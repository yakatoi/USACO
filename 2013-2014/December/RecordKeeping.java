1. Prologue: What Secrets Cost

Boilerplate disclaimer, applies to this and all future chapters: It's J.K. Rowling's sandbox, I'm just playing in it.

What this story is, in a nutshell: An AU covering Harry Potter's Hogwarts years, 1-7, with three main points of divergence. Those points:

1) Ariana survived the Grindelwald/Albus/Aberforth duel, and thus the history of Grindelwald's rise and fall is significantly different than canon.



2) Harry was born exactly one year earlier, and is thus one year ahead of his canon self - he's in the same year as Cho Chang and Katie Bell.

3) Sirius Black's trip to Azkaban was much shorter, as detailed in the prologue.

For more on the goals, mechanics, and plot points of this fic, see my profile. I share many authors' distaste for long A/Ns, so this is the compromise I came up with.

The Prologue is set about a month after Voldemort's downfall at Godric's Hollow. After that, it's all Harry Potter.



* * *



Prologue – What Secrets Cost

Sirius Black was going insane – unobtrusively. Azkaban was a quiet prison, as prisons went. The Dementors floated about, and the prisoners, chilled and sapped of animation, rarely made a sound. Every few hours the oppressive silence would be punctuated by a scream. Sirius could tell that it was different people screaming, but not who they were – the cells were too far apart, and the bars of his door looked out into a grey, dull hallway. But it was the same kind of scream every time – a bleak, raw, 'rage against the dying of the light' kind of scream. It would have unnerved him, if his mind was together enough to be unnerved.

Sirius had no idea how long he'd been there. It could have been a week, or a month, or four. His mind fumbled with disjointed images skittering in and out of focus, grasping for purchase.

"Got a few friends coming your way, Black."

Sirius looked up, trying to focus his gaze on the guard. The grizzled jailer was the only human being he'd seen in… his mind flinched away from that particular realization. The man, all heavy jowls and beady eyes, shoved a rough-hewn wooden bowl filled with something unidentifiable and grey through the bars of the cage.

"Friends?" asked Sirius, his voice alien to his own ears, raspy and thin. For a second, he felt a swell of something. He means… James? For a second, his mind mercifully muted his recent past, and warm memories bubbled to the surface. Hogwarts. Gryffindor. Quidditch. Pranks. Feasts, sneaking, girls, classes, corridors – and just like that, it evaporated like a breath in winter. The Dementors took anything warm, in the end. And one more name rose to the surface.

Wormtail.

Sirius choked back a scream as his brain shifted gears and quite rudely dumped him into the present.

"Reckon it'll be a nice little Death Eater reunion for you," said the guard, his mouth twisting into a sneer.

Sirius was in the process of forming a question when he heard a noise coming from down the hall. A cacophony of shouts, a staccato bang of curses, and one high, piercing laugh that he'd recognize anywhere. The group that came down the hall was large – a handful of guards ferrying four prisoners at wandpoint. Barty Crouch Jr. and the Lestrange brothers were going quietly – Barty, because he was limp and shaking, Rabastan and Rodolphus because they were clinging to their high-handed pureblood detachment for all it was worth. But it was taking three guards to subdue Bellatrix. Sirius's cousin looked a bit the worse for wear, her hair tangled into a rat's nest, and her black robes torn and tattered. When she saw Sirius, she locked eyes with him, threw back her head, and cackled.

"I said shut up, you stupid bint!" One of the guards jabbed his wand into Bellatrix's back, and with a flash of light, she stumbled to the ground. Her eyes never left Sirius's face as they dragged her past his cell, and she never stopped laughing.

"That's another four Death Eaters locked away," said the jailor with a hint of satisfaction. The man peered down the hallway to follow the progress of the new prisoners, then his beady eyes snapped back to Sirius. "Finish that right quick, or I'll come in and take it from you. I don't have all day."

Sirius started eating mechanically, idly considering a retort – the guard, in fact, did have all day. The human presence at Azkaban was a skeleton staff of low men on the Department of Magical Law Enforcement totem pole. Sorry excuse for a wizard probably really would come in here and take my bowl instead of using his wand, thought Sirius sourly. He can probably barely transfigure a teacup. He shuddered at the cold as he ate. Then again, considering the Dementors, he really doesn't need to.

"What did they do?" asked Sirius, gesturing down the hall with his spoon.

"They're Death Eaters," said the guard, his voice finally betraying an emotion, tightly controlled, as his face crumpled in rage. "Isn't that enough?"

Sirius could easily read the tapestry of pain and loss on the guard's face. It was a look he'd seen often enough in the years since the war started. With a slow shake of his head, Sirius pushed up the sleeve of his rags and bared his left forearm.

"No, you're worse, aren't you? Didn't even take the Mark. You were a spy. A traitor." The guard spat at Sirius, the wet glob landing in his lanky black hair. The guard jerked his finger over his shoulder, gesturing at the retreating group of new prisoners. "At least those pieces of human garbage were honest about it. Death Eaters to the bitter end. Went after the Longbottoms even after You-Know-Who fell to the Boy Who Lived and the Ministry started rounding up all of his blasted followers."

Sirius jolted himself out of his slouch. "What did you say?" he whispered. "The Longbottoms? Are they…?"

The guard sneered at him. "You'll be happy to know your cousin held them under the Cruciatus Curse for three hours looking for information on Voldemort and trying to get them to give up Harry Potter's location. They're at St Mungo's, and they're probably never getting out." He grinned savagely. "But they never broke. Bloody heroes, they are. Imagine what would have happened if those four had gotten to the Potter boy. Wrecked your coming out party, didn't he?" The guard's grin became feral.

Sirius weakly pushed the wooden bowl across the floor with his leg, his appetite gone. The guard reached through the bars and scooped up the bowl, and with a last, vicious look at Sirius, walked away. Sirius didn't even register his absence, his brain locked in a kind of spiral. Frank. Alice. The oppressive weight of the Dementors helped him on his way, until he couldn't stop picturing Bellatrix laughing and Alice screaming, and Frank's unresponsive eyes, and James's broken body, and Lily's auburn hair fanned out on the floor by the crib, and Harry crying…

The spiral stopped. It wasn't a happy thought, but it wasn't negative, and the Dementors couldn't take it from him. Harry. Harry is alive. My godson is alive. James and Lily's son is alive. Harry needs my help.

He held on to those thoughts like a hot ember against his heart, and though it tore at him, he remembered, and repeated his new, all-consuming goal like a mantra.

Sirius waited until nightfall. The Dementors never left, of course, but the guards slept. It wasn't like they needed to really guard anything. The Dementors took care of that. When he judged it close to midnight, he closed his eyes and transformed. It didn't come easy, and his very bones ached, and he whimpered pathetically as he sunk into his dog form, but he did it. He squeezed himself through the bars of the cell – however long he'd been there, a few scoops of gruel a day had left him emaciated – and padded down the hallway. He didn't remember his trip to Azkaban – everything from his confrontation with Peter to waking up in his cell was a hazy blur tinged with a desperate, furious chaos – but he figured that all else being equal, he'd head downward and see where that led him.

Finding his way out of the prison turned out to be simple. He loped out the main gate, right past two Dementors whose skeletal hands reached out, searching, clawing, but not truly sensing. He picked up speed and ran through the small, dingy graveyard and down to the craggy rocks of the beach, not even breaking stride as he plunged into the water.

The ocean was black and cold as death. His body rebelled against the terrible shock, but he forced his limbs into a jerky doggy paddle. He had no idea how far away the English coast was, or how long he'd last in the water, but he was beyond caring. He would swim until he couldn't swim any longer. And if the ocean swallowed him up, well, that wouldn't be so bad.



* * *



It had been a bad month for Remus Lupin. One moment they'd been at war, but happy. He had his friends, who were like his family, and it was dangerous for everyone but they were fighting back. The next moment, James and Peter were dead and Sirius was a traitor, a murderer, and in Azkaban for life. The three people he cared about most in the world were gone in one fell swoop.

Ever since that black Halloween, the wizarding world had been rocked by cataclysmic shifts. Dozens of Death Eaters rounded up in the wake of Voldemort's defeat. Dozens more shaking off the chains of the Imperius Curse at long last – or pretending to. Ministry workers reassigned, businesses reopening. The Order was gone, disbanded. And Remus Lupin somehow fell through the cracks. He was lost at sea. For the life of him, he couldn't figure out what to do. He wandered around his small flat and walked the streets of Muggle London waiting for his grief to make itself understandable to him.

He finally started sobbing one day over a t-shirt that James had gotten him for his birthday. It was black and red, and it had a picture of a grinning wolf with its tongue out. The caption under the picture said Werewolves Do It Monthly. He watched himself, as if from outside his body, gripping the shirt and soaking it with tears and he almost laughed at the absurdity of it.

James had gotten that shirt for him when he turned seventeen. That was three years ago. Remus Lupin was twenty years old and felt much, much older.

News of the attack on the Longbottoms, Sirius's escape from Azkaban, and the balled-up note all hit him at approximately the same time. Remus was sitting on the front steps of his flat, bravely chasing back the winter chill with a nice cup of tea, when a delivery own dropped a copy of the Daily Prophet in his lap. He stuck five Knuts in the owl's pouch, and then unrolled the paper only to find his former best friend's face splashed across the front page.

Below the fold were pictures of the Longbottoms. Remus's eyes scanned the page, his tea long forgotten, his hands clenching the newspaper in anger. He was just working himself into a good, old-fashioned murderous rage when the balled up piece of parchment hit him in the face. He blinked as it softly fell into his lap, only to magically smooth itself out, slide up his arm, and fold itself into his sleeve.

In less than a second, Remus was on his feet, wand out. The spell was one James had invented so the Gryffindor quartet could pass notes in class. Only two living people knew it, now, and if Remus had his way, soon there would be just one.

"SIRIUS!" he bellowed, his anger overriding good sense as he charged into the street, looking around wildly. "Come for me too, have you? Want to make a clean sweep of it? Come on, then, and try me! I promise, I'll put you down like the traitorous mongrel you are!"

He was breathing heavily as he spun in a circle, trying to look everywhere at once. After a few seconds it was clear that his ex-best friend wasn't going to make an appearance, and Remus retreated back to the steps of his flat. His anger had simmered down to a dull roar, and was being replaced with a healthy dose of guilt. The Prophet had emphasized the unprecedented nature of Sirius's escape from Azkaban, noting that not a single wizard or witch had escaped the island prison in the last hundred years. The article went on to almost gleefully theorize about what kind of Dark powers Sirius possessed, and how dangerous he might be to the average family.

Good for them. Now that Voldemort's been gone a month, they were running out of ways to scare people. I'm sure this will drum up some business, thought Remus sardonically.

The twisted smile slipped off his face. The paper also speculated about the exact means Sirius had used to escape, each theory more wild than the next.

Remus was pretty sure he knew how Sirius had done it.

He'd thought about coming clean a month ago when Sirius was tossed into Azkaban. Even written the letter to his former Headmaster. But he couldn't do it. Telling Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus meant admitting that Remus had betrayed Dumbldore's trust in letting him come to Hogwarts. It meant telling the person who'd opened the doors of Europe's most prestigious magical school to a werewolf that instead of keeping himself safe during the full moon, he'd been roaming the halls at night, putting children at risk because he was so selfishly happy to have real friends.

The piece of parchment in his sleeve rustled against his forearm, poking him, breaking him out of his reverie. He slowly drew it out and unrolled it. The handwriting was a familiar scrawl, and the words did nothing to help his fragile emotional control.

Moony,

It wasn't me. I convinced Prongs to switch at the last second. I thought it was clever. Wormtail was the Secret-Keeper. I went after him, he got the drop on me, blew up the street and transformed. At least I think he did. I was pretty out of it. I woke up in Azkaban. If there was a trial, I don't remember it.

I escaped when I heard what happened to Frank and Alice. I'm not asking you to trust me – James and I didn't trust you enough to tell you about the switch. Couldn't be sure it wasn't you leaking information to Voldemort. Knew it had to be someone close. Sorry about that. Never thought Peter had the stones for it.

Look, I can't prove anything I'm saying. But if even a tiny shred of you believes me, then I trust you figure out a way I can convince you. I'll be honest, I feel about as smart as a flobberworm right now. Reckon an extended stay at Chateau Azkaban has that effect on people. But just like always, I'm going to jump into trouble and count on my friend to get me out of it.

I'll be at the place in the Forest where we used to howl at the moon. I'd say 'come alone', but I'm in no position to be setting terms.

If you show up with a Hit Wizard squad I'll try not to hold it against you.

-Padfoot

Remus clenched the letter in his fist and closed his eyes.

It seemed his month of depression and inaction was about to end… one way or another.



* * *



Sirius paced back and forth on the bare rock. The clearing in the Forbidden Forest was unremarkable except for the several-meter wide stone, perfectly circular and almost white, buried in the ground. They'd found it in fifth year, when the novelty of their new Animagus forms was enough and they'd simply romped around the Forest, exploring. Remus had thought the rock must have been magical because of its unnatural symmetry, and they'd even sneaked out of the castle during the day to go back and test it, but they'd never found evidence that it was more than a rock.

Even if it wasn't magical, it did make a fairly excellent spot to pose dramatically during a full moon and let loose a wolf and/or dog howl.

The wind clattered through the branches of the leafless trees surrounding the clearing. Winter in Scotland had never been pleasant. Sirius drew his rags closer to his body, shuddering. He absently flicked his stolen wand, re-casting the Warming Charm around his body, though it helped little. The wand was a poor match, but it was better than nothing and he'd been lucky to nick it at all.

Sirius heard a low, muffled crack behind him, and he whirled around, managing to spot the outline of three figures before he was knocked off his feet by a brilliant, blinding white light.

He hit the rock hard, and spat out a mouthful of blood as he rose and slowly raised his hands, shaking the spots from his vision until he could make out the three people in front of him.

Albus Dumbledore looked as serene and implacable as ever, his majestic white beard gently swaying in the breeze. He had an unreadable but calm look on his face as he pointed his wand unwaveringly at Sirius. Belatedly, he realized that his own pilfered wand was resting comfortably in Albus's off-hand.

Remus Lupin was staring at Sirius with a look of such raw emotion and pain that it was all he could do not to rush over to him and embrace him in a manly hug.

The third man…

"What's he doing here?" asked Sirius, scowling.

Severus Snape regarded Sirius with his customary sneer, supremely unconcerned, his wand not even in his hand, looking, thought Sirius viciously, like he was a child hiding behind Dumbledore's robes.

"You asked me to figure out a way to believe you," said Remus, his voice cool and his face rearranging itself into a semblance of controlled detachment. "This is the way."

Sirius took an unconscious step back as Snape stepped forward, his hand plunging into his robes and coming up with a bottle of clear liquid.

"I'm not drinking anything from him," said Sirius, almost petulantly.

Dumbledore lowered his wand. "If you wish us to believe your rather incredible tale, we will require some proof as to the veracity of your claims."

"He wants to poison me," said Sirius, pointing at Snape.

"How perceptive," said Snape in that silky smooth voice. Sirius had forgotten how much the greasy git rubbed him the wrong way. "If you are responsible for the crimes you're accused of, as I'm quite sure that you are, it will be my very great pleasure to make sure your death is a painful one."

Sirius blinked. He'd never known Snape to particularly care for innocent lives, and certainly not the lives of Muggles. He'd hated James with a passion, and given their rather public falling out, he wasn't likely to have shed any tears for his one-time friend Lily Evans. The Order had him high on their list of suspected Death Eaters. So why was Snape looking at Sirius, who at this point was suspected of being everything Snape aspired to – like he'd strangled his puppy?

Sirius turned to Remus. "You trust him? After everything?"

Remus hesitated. "I trust Dumbledore. Dumbledore trusts him."

Snape swept forward and unscrewed the vial. "Enough of this. We're not the ones on trial here, Black. Drink, or you will be forced to."

Sirius looked at Dumbledore, who had stayed back, unmoving and impassive. "It's not reliable, you know. Veritaserum can be resisted. You must know that was part of Auror training."

"As the former Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, I do have a passing familiarity with the Auror department," said Dumbledore. "However, this particular batch was made by Severus himself, who, though you may find a trifle challenging to get along with, is a rather excellent Potions master."

Sirius hesitated as Snape held out a dropper well away from his body, as if he found the very concept of standing near Sirius to be distasteful. "I just want to make sure you've considered all the angles," he said. "When I tell you the truth, I want you to believe me."

Dumbledore nodded, stroking his beard. "Talented as you may be, Sirius, the combination of the potion along with my own observations will be sufficient, I believe. I am," he continued modestly, "a rather skilled Legilimens, after all."

Sirius took a deep breath, prepared to take the potion, but then pulled up short. "Did you say former Chief Warlock? What exactly – "

Dumbledore waved his hand dismissively. "As fascinating a story as my abrupt dismissal from the Wizengamot is, I'm afraid it must wait until you tell your own tale, Sirius "

Sirius huffed. "Fine, let's get this over with." He stuck out his tongue at Snape, who distastefully but carefully measured out three drops of Veritaserum onto it. All three men watched closely as Sirius closed his mouth and swallowed.

Immediately, he felt the potion's tendrils hook into his mind, wrapping around his thoughts and closing off all paths but the truth. He suppressed his instinctual response and let the effusive feeling of calm acceptance wash over him.

Dumbledore scrutinized him for a few long moments, then nodded to Remus.

Remus took a deep breath. "What is your name?"

Sirius felt the words flow from his lips. "Sirius Lycoris Black the Third."

Snape laughed. "What a perfectly ridiculous name."

Remus paid no attention and continued his questions. "From where did your middle name originate?"

"My great-aunt Lycoris Black," said Sirius.

"And why aren't you fond of that name?" asked Remus

Sirius bit his tongue, but the potion had him in its grip. "Because my cousin Narcissa dressed me up in girl's clothes and made me call myself Lycoris."

Snape looked like Christmas had come early.

Dumbledore stroked his beard again, his eyes merry. "I believe that proves the potion's efficacy. I do not believe Sirius would reveal that information in Severus's presence of his own volition." His merriment fell away and he regarded Sirius soberly. "Were you the Secret-Keeper for James and Lily Potter?"

"No," said Sirius clearly and evenly.

"Who was?"

"Peter Pettigrew."

Dumbledore leaned forward, very intent on Sirius. "Why did you choose to keep this information to yourself?"

At this, Sirius tensed up. He couldn't fight the potion completely, but he could be a bit…choosy when the question was as broad as that. "We wanted everyone to think that I was the Secret-Keeper. We knew someone was leaking information, so only the people involved in the ruse knew about it."

Snape pounced on that like a bat on a mosquito. "He's lying, Dumbledore! I can tell."

"Not lying, Severus," said Dumbledore calmly. "Merely telling only a portion of the truth. Sirius, why didn't you tell me the plan?"

Sirius felt the truth spill from his lips. "James didn't trust you, Albus. Something happened after you told them to go into hiding. They never told me what it was, but they learned something, and after that they were very careful around you. I asked James about it once, and he told me that it had something to do with why they went into hiding. Whatever reason you gave them for why you thought Voldemort was after them, they found out that you'd lied about it, or held something back, or deliberately twisted the truth, something like that."

Dumbledore had a pensive, faraway look in his eyes. "I see. That makes things… complicated."

Remus stepped forward and fixed Sirius with a piercing stare, ignoring Dumbledore. "How did you escape Azkaban?"

"They didn't feed me well. I transformed into Padfoot and I was skinny enough to fit through the bars. The Dementors couldn't find me. I swam to the coast."

"Why did you escape?"

"I saw them bring in Bellatrix and her friends. Heard what happened to Frank and Alice. Knew I had to protect Harry."

Remus studied Sirius for several long seconds. Then he turned to Dumbledore. "I believe him. I think he's telling the truth. Give him the antidote."

Dumbledore was still looking into the middle distance, and it took a moment for Remus's words to register. "I concur, Remus. Severus, please give Sirius the antidote."

Snape stepped forward, but Sirius waved him off. "No need. It's worn off enough that I can fight it." He regarded Snape, looking at him frankly. "Your hair isn't greasy at all, and I really, really respect you." He grinned toothily.

Dumbledore coughed politely, perhaps covering a smile as Snape glowered. Sirius ignored them and turned to Remus, a hopeful, almost shy grin on his face. "So you really believe me?"

"I believe you," said Remus.

They stepped forward as one and embraced, clutching each other tightly. "Sorry," they both muttered at the same instant.

As they parted, Sirius found that his voice was a bit hoarse as he cleared his throat and squared his shoulders. "So now that that's over with, how about some answers?"

Dumbledore still seemed distracted by something, but at Sirius's words, he shook his head, clearing out the cobwebs, and nodded decisively. "Yes. Perhaps that would be best. We have much to discuss, and much to plan, and little time to do it. I suggest we all make ourselves comfortable."

Sirius was about to interject that he couldn't exactly get comfortable while shivering against the wind on a slab of rock in the Forbidden Forest, but his words died in his throat as Dumbledore lazily waved his wand and the sound of the wind was muted down to a low rustling, while at the same time the air around them heated itself all the way up to comfortable. With a sharp flick of his wand, Dumbledore conjured four squashy chintz armchairs. He was sitting down before he even finished the wand motion, settling into the chair without even confirming its existence. Even with so many other pressing concerns, Sirius couldn't help but admire Dumbledore's casual mastery of magic.

"So," said Sirius as he plopped himself down on a chair. "Former Chief Warlock? Just how long have I been in Azkaban?"

"Thirty-six…hmm," Dumbledore snapped open his pocket watch, glancing at the bizarre configuration of planets and multitude of hands. "Thirty-seven days."

Sirius shuddered. "Felt longer."

"Indeed. Azkaban is a terrible place, and I am sincerely sorry that you suffered it unjustly." Dumbledore snapped his watch closed, forestalling Sirius's objection. "And before you ask, Sirius, I had nothing to do with your lack of trial. The Council of Magical Law has, under the leadership of Bartemius Crouch, taken sole responsibility for all Death Eater trials. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement has been rather…ardent…in their pursuit of justice, and given my reputation, I felt it wise not to oppose Bartemius."

"Anything less than full-throated support of the Ministry hasn't been tolerated this last month," said Remus. "People are feeling very patriotic now that we've won. Although, with Crouch's son exposed as a Death Eater, it's all shot to hell again. I honestly don't know how people are going to take that."

"As if it matters," said Snape, waving his hand contemptuously. "The Ministry will no doubt reorganize itself into a fascinating new configuration of the same mediocrity and incompetence. Crouch is nothing."

"On the contrary," said Dumbledore quietly, "Bartemius is a man of strong conviction, and though the Minister's position is beyond his reach now, he is not a man to be written off. If and when Voldemort returns, he has the potential to be a powerful ally, or a difficult roadblock."

Sirius's knuckles went white as he clutched the armchair. "He's not dead, then? I heard a few rumors in Azkaban, but nothing concrete."

Remus shifted nervously. "Everyone's acting like he's dead, but no one's really confirming it. People talk about him being gone, or defeated, or banished. But no one's actually saying he's dead. The one thing that's generally agreed upon is that they didn't find a body."

Sirius turned to Dumbledore for confirmation.

"Indeed," said Dumbledore. He arched an eyebrow at Sirius. "Though, from my understanding, it was you who was 'first on the scene,' as the Muggles would say. You didn't by chance notice a very dead Lord Voldemort, did you?"

Sirius closed his eyes, flashes of memory assaulting his senses. He hadn't heard from Peter in a few days, and he'd felt unsettled. He'd known right away that something was wrong when he'd gone to the Potters and hadn't felt that characteristic dragging sensation of Apparating through a Fidelius Charm. The images from inside the house would be imprinted in his mind forever. James had died violently, his body battered and bloody, but it was Lily who would haunt Sirius's nightmares. She was there, in that ruined room, splayed out on the floor, not a mark on her, little Harry's crying a flood on his senses. Her expression was terrible to behold. Her last moments frozen on her face – fear, rage, fierce love. Her eyes were wide open.

He'd picked up Harry, knelt over Lily, looked around the room, and…

"There was no body," said Sirius, his voice shaking a little. "It was just…just Lily and Harry."

Dumbledore raised an eyebrow. "Not even a wand? A pile of robes, perhaps?"

Sirius shook his head. "No, nothing. I was pretty shaken up, and the nursery looked like someone tossed an overpowered bombarda into the south wall, but I would have noticed anything that looked like Voldemort's remains. There was a lot of magic, though. The air was practically saturated with it. I didn't have time to delve into that, though. Harry was crying, and bleeding…" At this, he hesitated.

Dumbledore took his meaning. "I assure you, Sirius, Harry is quite safe."

Sirius relaxed, but not all the way. "Good. But… what happened, Albus? After I escaped, I snuck into a pub in Dover, figured I could nick a wand. Thought it would be easier to try on someone who was already three sheets to the wind. And then I heard some people toasting Harry Potter. Saying how he'd beat You-Know-Who." Sirius shook his head, his long, dark hair falling into his face. "Is my godson a folk hero at age one?"

Remus winced. "Hagrid wasn't very discreet. He told the Hit Wizards who showed up at the Potters after you'd left, and then a pub full of people later that night, and it kind of snowballed from there. It's common knowledge. I doubt there's a wizard in Great Britain who hasn't heard the story."

"But what is the story?" said Sirius, blinking rapidly. He was feeling foggy, and things weren't adding up for him, but he couldn't tell how much of that was the situation and how much the aftereffects of Azkaban.

"It's pretty vague," said Remus, shrugging. "Voldemort went to the Potters, killed James and Lily, turned his wand on Harry, and somehow couldn't kill him. The curse backfired."

Sirius gaped. "And people just accept that? That makes sense to people?"

"People are fools," said Snape waspishly. "They'll not look too hard at their good fortune. They'd believe the Potter child was a time-traveling Merlin if it meant the Dark Lord was gone."

"But he is not gone," said Dumbledore, his quiet voice nonetheless commanding attention. "And there is at least one Death Eater free and striving for his return. I'm afraid what Sirius saw proves that."

"Proves it how?" asked Sirius.

"There was powerful magic at work that night," said Dumbledore grimly. "Old magic. We may never know for certain exactly why young Harry survived, but Lily's death was no accident; she chose it, and her sacrifice proved to be a truly powerful protection. The Killing Curse did indeed backfire – instead of leaving the body and destroying the soul, it did the opposite. Voldemort's body was destroyed, but his soul remains. He lingers, even now, with less presence and ability to affect the world than the most pitiful spirit, but here nonetheless."

Remus looked thoughtful, and Snape wore a hooded, guarded look. "But… how is that possible?" asked Sirius. "If Voldemort's body was destroyed, how can he still be around? How can the soul exist without the body?"

"How indeed?" said Dumbledore. That faraway, pensive look was back. "I fear the answer to that question may be of some importance in the future, and rather sooner than we'd wish. The Dark Marks on the captured Death Eaters tell us that. Faded, yes, but not collapsed. The Mark is a complex bit of soul magic. Tom always had a knack for such things." Dumbledore lapsed into a wistful silence.

Sirius licked his lips. Dumbledore was being cagey. "Albus. What do you know? You must have some reason to believe he's not dead beyond what you've said. You wouldn't base your reasoning on how faded a tattoo is. Not just that, anyway. You know something else. You have to."

"I know many things, Sirius," said Dumbledore, his hands clasped in front of him. "But despite rumors to the contrary, I am not even slightly omniscient."

Sirius slumped despondently. "Please, Albus. Think of what secrets have just cost us."

There was something in Sirius's voice that made Dumbledore look at him, then. A steady, calculating gaze that seemed to take the measure of him, deep down.

"You are quite right, Sirius," said Dumbledore, and Snape stirred in his chair, looking like he might interrupt, but Dumbledore's next words quieted him down. "I must beg your forgiveness, however. Some secrets are not mine to tell. Suffice to say that I believe quite strongly that Voldemort will rise again, that he will seek Harry Potter's death again, and that we must do all in our power to oppose him."

Something about Dumbledore's words tickled at the back of Sirius's mind, but his overtaxed brain was unable to make the connection.

Sirius was on the verge of protesting, but Remus leaned forward and shook his head, catching Sirius's eye. Now is not the time, said his unspoken look. The werewolf turned to Dumbledore and asked, "You said something about there being a Death Eater trying to bring him back?"

"Indeed," said Dumbledore. He stood up, lazily banishing the chair, and began pacing. Sirius was immediately reminded of the many Order meetings he'd attended, Dumbledore thinking out loud, pacing just like that. "Voldemort's missing body may be accounted for by the unique circumstances of the backfiring Killing Curse, but for his wand to be gone as well…"

"Peter," said Sirius, straightening up, his voice dropping to a monotone. "It had to be."

"That was my conclusion as well," said Dumbledore. "And I fear tracking him down will be quite challenging, especially given the revelation of his Animagus form."

"He probably ran to the nearest master that would take him," said Sirius nastily. "We should check the Malfoys. He's probably licking Lucius's boot as we speak."

"The Malfoys have been exonerated, Black," said Snape. "Unwilling victims of the Imperius Curse. Did no one bother to tell you while you were chained up?"

"Unwilling my saggy left – " Sirius was quickly Silenced by Dumbledore with a quick flick of his wand.

"I suggest we keep this discussion civil," he said mildly.

"Pettigrew would find a cold welcome with the Malfoys, in any case," said Snape, clearly enjoying the furious but silent looks Sirius was giving him, combined with a few violent hand gestures conveying something anatomically impossible. "The Dark Lord's former followers are very…displeased… with the one whom they view as being responsible for his downfall."

"So he ran," said Remus, looking out into the Forest, the hundreds of dark trees swaying in the muted breeze. "He could be anywhere by now. Absolutely anywhere."

"It is imperative that we find him, nonetheless," said Dumbledore. "Even such a relatively unassuming wizard as Peter Pettigrew would be a powerful ally given sufficient commitment."

"Which he has," said Remus grimly. "There's nothing else left for him now." He leaned forward in his chair. "It's going to have to be Sirius and me, isn't it?"

"Don't be absurd," said Snape, scoffing. "A werewolf and an escaped convict, traipsing around Europe looking for a rat?"

"I hate to agree with Snivellus," said Sirius, finally breaking through the Silencing Charm, "but he's right. It sounds like the start of a bad joke."

"No, it has to be," said Remus, lost in thought. "Sirius, you missed a lot. The Order's all but disbanded. James and Lily gone, Frank and Alice…" he trailed off, looking down.

"I heard about that," said Sirius, a glum look crossing his face. He looked up at Dumbledore. "Is there really no hope?"

"There is always hope," said Dumbledore. "Alas, in this case I fear that hope will be in vain."

"You could have just said no," muttered Sirius.

"It's an old man's privilege to dispense inscrutable wisdom," said Dumbledore mildly.

Sirius was opening his mouth for a rejoinder, but Remus cut him off. "Sirius, they kicked him out of the Wizengamot. And it's six to five and pick 'em whether or not he's still Headmaster by this time tomorrow."

Sirius blinked, completely nonplussed. "What? Who…? I mean, why…?"

"Articulate as always, Black," said Snape.

"When the Aurors got to the Longbottoms, they swept the house for clues trying to track down the people responsible," said Remus. "Obviously they succeeded, but they found something else, too. Alice's diary." Dumbledore sighed heavily, and stopped pacing. Remus looked up at him almost nervously, but continued. "She was always a little leery of some of what the Order did. She was a good soldier, always went along with it, but she kept a diary that was very critical of some of the Order's more… ethically pragmatic actions."

Sirius's overtaxed mind whirled as he flashed back to the darkest days of the war. The Order hadn't always had the luxury of playing nice. He scratched his unkempt beard. "Let me guess. That dust-up in Wakefield?"

"And the altercation with the goblins in Ashford," said Remus grimly. "But what really made a dog's dinner of it was Alice ranting about that absolute cock-up in Glasgow."

"Bad business, that," said Sirius, looking down. And it had been. The fog hadn't helped, or the dark, or the fact that they'd gotten their wires crossed somewhere along the way and ended up in a three-way pitched battle with Death Eaters and Aurors.

"Yes, it was," said Remus. "And it looked worse from the outside. The Aurors didn't know we were there for Jugson, so when we nabbed him it looked like we were helping the Death Eaters escape. Doge covering our retreat certainly didn't help; he wasn't too picky who he cursed. And we did leave the Aurors there, and not all of them made it back, including a close friend of Alice's."

"Jugson had information we believed vital to the war effort," said Dumbledore, who stood still as a statue, his hands clasped behind his back, looking up at the sky. "Information that directly led to preventing dozens of deaths."

"I know that, and you know that, but most people don't know that," said Sirius. "You have to admit, there are a couple sides to this. And now that the public knows Alice's side…" he trailed off.

"They seem quite unwilling to forgive and forget," said Dumbledore. "An altogether unsurprising development, considering my role in Gellert's rise and fall. I had hoped that my years of faithful public service might have restored some of my rather tarnished reputation, but it was not to be. Alice's diary had some scathing words for Minister Bagnold's handling of the Auror Office as well, and though nothing is certain at this point, the Minister may be forced out of office as well. She and I have never had the most pleasant working relationship, and I fear her attitude at this point is decidedly of the 'if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me,' nature. In the past few days, she's been the architect of a series of articles calling for my dismissal from my various positions."

"That's…a big deal," said Sirius, trying to process the idea of a Wizarding Britain without Albus Dumbledore.

"Again, your mastery of the English language astounds me, Black," said Snape. "With Dumbledore effectively cut out of the government, and more likely than not gone from Hogwarts, the consequences will be far-reaching and unknowable."

Dumbledore turned around, his gaze intense. "Which is why we must move quickly. Sirius, you and Remus must track down Peter, starting tonight, if possible. The longer you dally, the colder the trail gets. Logically, starting the search in England makes the most sense, and as Severus pointed out, England may well soon be out of my sphere of influence."

Caught up in his energy, Sirius stood, as did the others, and Dumbledore banished the rest of the armchairs.

"Not that I think it's a good idea," said Remus cautiously as he stood up, "but is Severus coming with us?"

"Absolutely not," said Sirius and Snape at the same time. They each turned and shot each other a scowl.

"Severus is needed elsewhere," said Dumbledore. "One of my final acts as Headmaster may have been his appointment as the new professor of Potions."

"Well, that sucks for Potions," muttered Sirius.

Snape looked all set to counter that with a sneer and a cutting comment, but Dumbledore swept into motion. "Let us return to Hogsmeade. My brother can provide the two of you with provisions, as well as a safe place to stay the night."

Sirius raised an eyebrow. "Aberforth still owns the Hog's Head? I thought he gave that up when he started teaching."

"Keeping his inn was one of several rather…unique… conditions that my brother insisted on before he took the Care of Magical Creatures position," said Dumbledore distractedly as he looked Sirius over. "Remus, perhaps you should Side-Along Sirius to Hogsmeade. You look a bit worse for wear, Sirius."

Remus nodded, moving to take Sirius's arm, but Sirius again stopped them with a word. "Harry. Where is he?"

"Safe," replied Dumbledore, his voice betraying a hint of impatience. "As I said."

"Let me try that again, Albus," said Sirius. He seemed to shed his tiredness as he stood up straight. "Where is my godson? Because I'm not going anywhere until I'm sure he's okay. If tracking Peter is that important, I'll do it, and until I can clear my name I can't exactly raise him as an escaped convict, but I will do everything in my power to make sure he's safe and happy."

Dumbledore seemed to study Sirius for a moment. "I placed Harry with the only family he has left," he said at last. "Lily's sister Petunia and her husband will raise the boy."

"No!" Sirius and Snape shot each other a look as they spoke at the same time once again, surprised and almost offended by their mutual agreement.

"How could you do that?" said Sirius, aghast. "Lily's sister is a horrid woman. James told me all about her. She's not fit to raise a houseplant, much less James's son."

"The Dursleys are thoroughly Muggle and quite unpleasant, but they are Harry's last living blood relatives," said Dumbledore amicably, quite calm in the face of Sirius's obvious fury and Snape's subtler, cold rage.

"Petunia is more than merely unpleasant, Headmaster," said Snape. "She's a foul, noxious woman of limited intelligence and limitless pettiness."

"What do you care, anyway?" asked Sirius, twisting to fix Snape with a suspicious glare.

"I don't, Black," snapped Snape. "The brat could be raised by wolves, for all I care. I was merely expressing my opinion of Petunia."

Abruptly, Sirius noticed that Snape was not his usual cold, sneering self. He had those elements, to be sure, but his emotions were much closer to the surface than usual, and behind his icy demeanor, there was a hint of something…raw. An open wound.

"Regardless of Petunia's character," said Dumbledore, raising his hands in a placating gesture, "young Harry must reside in her home. The protection against Voldemort that Lily's sacrifice engendered was blood magic. Familial magic. As such, it lives on in Petunia. Her taking Harry into her home, however reluctantly, sealed the charm I placed upon him. While he calls that place home, it is the safest in the world for him."

"From Voldemort, maybe," said Sirius, turning away from his contemplation of Snape's odd behavior to growl at Dumbledore. "Not from being raised by a vicious, horse-faced shrew and her fat, loudmouth husband."

"Would you rather I had placed him with a loving family, close friends of the Potters, such as Frank and Alice?" asked Dumbledore quietly.

That was enough to bring Sirius up short. He shuddered. "Fine. I get your point. But someone has to look out for him. There's got to be some oversight, someone looking out for Harry's interests."

Dumbledore glanced speculatively at Snape. "Perhaps…"

Sirius's eyes nearly fell out of his head, and Remus looked a little ill, but it was Snape himself who reacted most strongly.

Snape laughed. It was an unhinged, bitter, ugly laugh. "Oh, yes, a splendid idea, Headmaster." He leaned over, as if talking to a child. "Hello, Potter brat, I'm Professor Snape. Magic is real. You can conjure a pretty bunny rabbit, but you can also rip the memories from someone, compel them to strangle themselves with their own intestines, make them forget their own name, give them a potion to twist their outsides into a different gender, confront them with a creature that turns into their worst nightmare, or simply kill them with a flick of the wrist and two words. It's also quite possible to make promises that will kill you if you break them, or spark a duel to the death over something you don't understand."

Dumbledore sighed. "Perhaps not."

Sirius was taking deep, calming breaths. "Definitely not."

Remus went to Sirius's side, putting a hand on his shoulder. "We all want Harry to be safe and happy. We just need to figure out a way to do that."

Sirius looked around, holding the gaze of the other three men. He was mentally and physically exhausted, half-starved, cold, and an emotional wreck. It had been a long night, and it was about to get longer. He squared his shoulders.

"I'll tell you what we're going to do."

Chapter 1 – The Mirror

Harry Potter sat on a bench in King's Cross and thought about breakfast.

The crowds of people swirled around him, thankfully ignoring the small boy with the large trunk and the owl in the cage. The Dursleys had been eager to get rid of him and head to the hospital for Dudley's procedure, so they'd dropped him off in the cold light of dawn, hours before the scheduled departure of the Hogwarts Express, a train that was set to take him to something grand and huge and life-altering.

A magic castle, a life free from the Dursleys, a vault full of gold, a scar people wouldn't stop staring at, and a wand that was somehow connected to the evil wizard who'd murdered his parents. It was, reflected Harry, quite enough to be going on with. So why couldn't he stop thinking about the breakfast he'd cooked that morning?

It hadn't been an unusual breakfast – quite the opposite, in fact. But there was something about the memory that struck him as important. Standing there in the kitchen in Dudley's oversized clothes, the tile floor chilling his feet, quickly and efficiently toasting bread and frying eggs like he'd done a thousand times before… and yet, his mind wouldn't stop fixating on it.

This would be easier to figure out if it weren't so noisy, thought Harry. King's Cross was bustling with activity as the morning commute filled the station. No one spared him a passing glance, which suited Harry just fine. He'd been more unnerved than he'd like to admit by his first exposure to the wizarding world; a bunch of strangers crowding him and touching him in the Leaky Cauldron wasn't exactly relaxing, and Hagrid's whirlwind tour of Diagon Alley had raised more questions than it'd answered.

"What do you think, Hedwig? Should we try to find somewhere else to sit?" Harry had gotten into the habit of talking to the snowy owl during the long month between his trip to Diagon Alley and the start of term, a time when the Dursleys had studiously ignored his existence. It would have been slightly pathetic, but he'd gotten the strangest feeling that Hedwig was actually listening to him, and after a few weeks he was surprised and more than a little depressed to realize the owl was quite literally the best friend he'd ever had.

Hedwig ruffled her feathers and gave him a bleary, flat look.

"Guess we'll stay put," said Harry. He craned his head above the crowd, keeping an eye on the barrier between Platforms 9 and 10. As the clock high on the wall had inched towards the departure time of 11 o'clock, Harry had spotted more and more Hogwarts families – they were pretty easy to pick out based on their dress alone. He figured there must be some kind of magic at work diverting attention from the barrier between platforms, because the Hogwarts people weren't exactly subtle about walking through a ticket box.

"Right, then," muttered Harry. He stood up and arranged his luggage cart, repositioning Hedwig's cage on top of his trunk. He hesitated, his excitement tinged with a healthy dose of nervousness. Harry glanced down at his trunk, cracked it open, almost changed his mind, then opened it fully and grabbed something off the top of the disorganized pile of clothes and school supplies.

Hedwig gave him a reproachful look, though Harry wasn't sure if it was for the object he now held in his hand, or for the way she'd been jostled around on top of his trunk as he'd rummaged around inside it.

"Look, it's not a real solution, I know that," he said to her. "I'm not hiding who I am or anything, I just don't want to be mobbed again." With that, he jammed the baseball cap on his head with more confidence than he felt.

The hat had cost him all the money he'd been able to scrounge up over the summer, but it was still the cheapest he'd been able to find within walking distance of King's Cross. It was dark blue and the fabric felt thin and cheap, and it had a cheerful Union Jack emblazoned on the brim, but it was better than nothing.

Harry adjusted the hat, pulling it low, the brim flush with his glasses, making sure his unruly dark hair wasn't poking out too much. Hagrid had mentioned how much he resembled his parents, but everyone in Diagon Alley had seemed to key in on his scar.

Well, it will either work or it won't, he thought. Hedwig was still looking at him, and he shifted guiltily on his feet. It wasn't like he was hiding, exactly. He didn't mind being himself, and he didn't mind other people knowing something about his past, but he still hadn't quite worked out how he felt about the fact that an evil wizard had murdered his parents, and having random people shaking his hand, thanking him for not being murdered alongside them wasn't helping, and bloody hell, he was thinking about breakfast again. He shook his head. This was getting ridiculous. He glanced up at the clock again. Might as well get this over with.

With a deep breath, Harry gave his luggage cart a push, accelerated to a brisk jog, and stepped into another world.



* * *



Platform Nine and Three-Quarters was a riot of noise and steam.

The Hogwarts Express, it turned out, was a regal-looking locomotive painted a sharp green with silver trim. The train was only a backdrop to the chaos, though. Parents and children of every age were everywhere, shouting greetings, saying tearful goodbyes, and lugging trunks onto the train.

Harry navigated through the crowd as best he could. The first few carriages were already filled; in some places students were hanging out the windows to accept last-minute packages from tearful parents. Harry pushed his cart further down the platform, looking for something a bit more sedate.

A few strenuous minutes later, he was sitting comfortably in an empty compartment near the back of the train, his trunk settled into the luggage rack. With no pressing concerns, he looked out the window and watched the crowd.

After a few minutes he noticed something odd. As families kept coming through the barrier, Harry saw a peculiar pattern: a great majority of the parents would glance at the train as they came through the barrier, and then either smile or frown slightly, always at the train itself, and always just for a second, as if not wanting to be too obvious about it.

"What do you make of that, Hedwig? You'd think the parents would have seen the train before." Harry said, making a mental note to cut back on holding long conversations with Hedwig, as 'Boy Who Talks To His Owl All The Time' was only marginally better than 'Boy Who Lived,' as monikers went.

"The train is painted the color of last year's House Cup winners," said a voice coming from behind him. "Slytherin's won five years in a row, and the parents who are former Slytherins or have Slytherin kids are pretty pleased with themselves. Other parents not so much."

Harry quickly turned away from the window to regard the speaker, who was a dark-haired girl around his own age, with a composed, friendly expression and pale, Asian features.

"At least that's what my mum says," said the girl, who looked a little more uncertain as she amended her statement. She hefted her trunk, which she was dragging awkwardly behind her. "Can I sit here? This thing is pretty heavy."

"Sure," said Harry. He got to his feet and helped the girl lift the trunk up to the luggage rack, which was a good thing because it seemed to be about twice as heavy as his own.

"Thanks," said the girl happily as she sat down across from him. "I'm Cho, by the way."

"Harry." He looked back out the window, not really knowing what to say, but, determined to brazen his way through his first real conversation in about a month, he asked, "so are you just starting Hogwarts as well?"

"Yes," said Cho. "I'm chuffed to bits to be here. I've wanted to go to Hogwarts ever since I can remember."

"So you grew up knowing about - " Harry waved his hand, indicating the platform outside the window. " – all this?"

"Of course," said Cho, nonplussed. Then her eyes widened fractionally. "Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean…" she held up her hands as her voice sped up. "It's not like I have a problem with Muggle-borns."

"I'm not a Muggle-born, or at least I don't think I am," said Harry. "That's kind of what I mean, though. If you don't grow up around all this stuff, it can be pretty confusing, all these new terms and ideas."

Cho bit her lower lip as she frowned thoughtfully. "I suppose that makes sense. I've never really thought about it." She tilted her head. "If you're not a Muggle-born, though, how did you grow up not knowing anything about magic?"

"My parents died when I was very young," said Harry. He winced at Cho's expression, but ploughed on. "I grew up with my aunt and uncle. Living with them is all I can remember, and as far as they were concerned, magic didn't exist."

Cho looked torn between compassion and natural curiosity. "I'm really sorry about your parents, Harry. That's just awful." She was able to hold it in for a few seconds, but then… "But… how come your aunt and uncle didn't tell you anything?"

Harry was saved from answering that particularly thorny question when the compartment door slid open. Three boys near Harry's age stood there, all dragging trunks, looking sweaty but excited.

"Hey, these seats taken?" asked the one who seemed to be the leader. He had an easygoing demeanor and close-cropped brown hair.

"Um…" Cho looked over at Harry surreptitiously. "I guess not," she said when Harry shrugged.

"Great!" said the brown-haired boy. "The train's about to leave and these things aren't getting any lighter." He indicated the trunks.

The other two boys started hauling their trunks inside. One was skinny and blond with a slightly upturned nose. The other was big, with wiry hair and ruddy features and a heavyset face.

The first boy sat next to Harry. "First years?" Harry and Cho both nodded. "Yeah, us too. I met these two on the platform. They were just telling me all about Hogwarts." He stuck out his hand to Harry. "I'm Mike Vaisey, by the way. Everyone calls me Vaisey."

The skinny blond boy was still struggling with his trunk, but turned for a second and muttered, "Zacharias Smith."

"Cormac McLaggen," said the third boy, who reached up and pushed Zacharais's trunk into place with one firm shove. As they settled into their seats, the train let out a shrill whistle and began to move, gathering speed.

"Nice to meet you all," said Cho, looking a bit more reserved than when she'd been talking to Harry. "I'm Cho Chang."

Harry was in the middle of shaking Vaisey's hand. "Harry Potter."

Vaisey's reaction was simply to nod as he shook Harry's hand, but Cho, Cormac, and Zacharias whipped their heads around to stare at Harry.

"Oh…" said Cho, almost to herself, her face lighting up with understanding.

"No way!" Cormac leaned forward, his eyes popping out.

"Really?" said Zacharias doubtfully. "Let's see the scar, then."

Harry frowned at that last statement, but before he could tell Zacharias exactly what he could do with his disbelief, Vaisey released his hand and looked around the compartment. "Uh, sorry, am I supposed to know you?" he asked. "I just got my letter last month, and my parents and I have been playing some catch-up with this whole 'magic being real' thing." He tried cracking a grin, but it faltered as the energy in the compartment didn't get any less tense.

"Uh…" Harry glanced around for help, but the other three were still looking at him like he was some kind of mysterious zoo animal. He half-turned to Hedwig for help before catching himself, then with a mental shrug, turned back to Vaisey. "I guess I'm a bit…famous." He said the word very reluctantly. "You know about Voldemort?"

Cho, Zacharias, and Cormac all flinched, but Vaisey just said, "Yeah, I read something about him when I was picking up my books. He's, like, a terrorist, right? Some nutter who used magic to kill a bunch of people a couple years ago?"

"Bit more to it than that, mate," said Cormac, a bit too smugly for Harry's taste.

Zacharias wore a guarded frown. "Yeah, I'd be careful how you talk about that stuff. And don't say his name. You-Know-You is a pretty touchy subject."

Vaisey nodded soberly. "Er…right. I tend to just say things, don't mind me. Touchy subject, got it. What does Vol – sorry, You-Know-Who, have to do with Harry here?"

"He, um, killed my parents," said Harry.

Vaisey shrugged. "Not to put too fine a point on it, but it sounded like he killed a lot of people's parents." Everyone stared at him, and he blushed faintly.

"Blimey, Vaisey," said Cormac, his expression almost impressed.

"Stupid lack of filter," muttered Vaisey. He turned to Harry with an apologetic grin. "You were saying?"

Harry shrugged. "Not much to tell. Voldemort – " he had to pause as Zacharias and Cormac flinched in their seats, the former giving him a dirty look. " – killed my parents when I was a year old, and then tried to do me in as well, but something happened. The curse didn't work, I got this scar on my forehead, and Voldemort, uh, was gone. And that," he finished rather lamely, "is what happened."

Vaisey scratched his head. "That's awful about your parents. Kind of a stupid story, though."

"Stupid?" said Cho, aghast. She glared at Vaisey. "Harry Potter defeated You-Know-Who. He saved everyone. That's not stupid."

Vaisey looked around, apparently undaunted by the three rather hostile looks he was getting from Cho, Zacharias, and Cormac. "What do you mean, defeated?"

"Defeated," said Zacharias as if talking to a much younger child. "As in, gone, no more, vanquished."

"I know what the word means," said Vaisey, showing a bit of irritation for the first time. "But it sounds like everyone knows the story but not what really happened." He turned to Harry. "So did you stand defiantly in front of You-Know-Who, wearing nappies and holding a baby-sized wand? Three inches, balsa wood and unicorn dandruff, slightly chewed?"

Harry grinned, to the surprise of the rest of the compartment.

"Not that I know of," he said. "I don't remember anything, actually. I don't think anyone knows what really happened. I just heard the story last month myself."

"Last month?" said Zacharias, his eyebrows climbing his forehead. "You mean you didn't even know who you were?"

"Of course I know who I am," said Harry, starting to feel a creeping sense of dislike for the blond. "I've always been Harry Potter, now I just know something about my parents."

Zacharias shook his head, seemingly lost for words.

"Can we see the scar?" said Cormac, leaning forward eagerly.

"That's very rude," snapped Cho.

"No it's not," said Cormac. "I want to see it because it's cool."

"It's not cool!" Cho seemed to be getting genuinely upset. "It's where someone tried to kill him!"

"I think it's kind of cool." Vaisey raised his hand. "I mean, a scar from someone trying to kill you and failing? That's tough to beat. All I've got is a scar from when my brother whacked me with a post-hole digger. It's pretty wicked, though." He lifted his shirt to demonstrate.

"That is wicked," said Cormac, craning his neck to get a good look. "I've got one from when my brother bet me I couldn't juggle Mum's good steak knives." He looked down at the thin scar on his forearm almost mournfully. "It's not as cool as yours, though."

"I'm starting to really regret meeting both of you," said Zacharias.

"I think I'm going to get some air," said Harry, standing. Four sets of eyes instantly locked onto him, like they'd forgotten he was there. Harry slid open the compartment door and walked out without a backward glance.

He walked down the length of the train, looking out at the countryside as it sped past. He felt a little numb. Guess I should have expected that, he thought sourly. It might have been optimistic, but he'd held on to hope that maybe kids his own age, not having lived through the dark times Hagrid had told him about, wouldn't make as much out of his story as the adults in Diagon Alley. If the scene in the compartment was a sign of things to come, though, he really shouldn't get his hopes up.

He'd been singled out at school his entire life – Dudley had made sure of that – but Harry wasn't sure that trading isolation and insults for impolite questions about his parents and his scar was much of an upgrade. He just didn't get it. Harry tried to imagine what he would have thought if, for some inexplicable reason, the Prime Minster's son had been in his class. Would Harry have treated him any differently? Harry had to really strain the hypothetical to gloss over the fact that Dudley wouldn't have let him get anywhere near the hypothetical kid, but assuming he did, Harry really liked to think it wouldn't have mattered. Why should it? It wasn't like the kid had done anything special.

So it must be more than that, with me, thought Harry. Either that, or everyone else thinks differently than I do. The problem was he didn't have enough information. A brief tour of Diagon Alley, some well-meaning but rather scattered tidbits of information from Hagrid, and a bunch of books on magical theory and history didn't give him any kind of context for what the wizarding world was actually like.

He was just firming up his resolve to learn as much as possible about everything he could in the shortest amount of time when he quite literally stumbled into someone. The other boy was taller, with dark brown hair and bright grey eyes, and was just exiting a compartment. He'd been looking over his shoulder to close the door, and Harry, lost in thought, had barreled into him.

They both stumbled back. "Sorry," muttered Harry.

"No problem," said the other boy. He brushed off his neatly-pressed jeans and turned to make sure the compartment door was closed behind him.

There was no one else in the train hallway, and Harry, having no particular aim at the moment, leaned against one of the walls. The other boy didn't seem to be paying attention to Harry at all, but he didn't leave, either, instead copying Harry's move, leaning against the opposite wall and crossing his arms.

"So what are you doing out here, anyway?" asked the boy abruptly.

"I just needed a minute. Things were getting a little tense in my compartment."

The boy blinked. "A little early for that kind of drama, isn't it? I mean you're a first year – I don't recognize you, anyway. What could have happened to make you storm out of a compartment?"

"I didn't storm out," said Harry irritably. "I just exited a situation that no longer interested me."

"So you said things like that, I gather."

Harry fought down a smile as he took off his hat. He wasn't quite sure why he did it, but he pushed aside his hair, making his scar eminently visible.

The other boy's eyes flicked to the scar, then he nodded thoughtfully. "Huh. I'd heard he was starting this year."

"In this case, he is me."

"Well, not really, though," said the boy. "I mean, who knows what Harry Potter is actually like? I mean, there's the story, and then there's some kid who might be any kind of person."

Harry gaped at him. He certainly hadn't expected that. He'd been so prepared for all kinds of unpleasant reactions to his name that the one thing he wasn't ready for was calm understanding.

"I'm Cedric, by the way," said the boy, sticking out his hand. "Cedric Diggory."

Harry took it slowly. "Harry Potter."

"Well, we'll see about that, won't we?" grinned Cedric. Harry grinned right back, and they released each other's hand, sharing a moment of surprisingly companionable silence.

"So, why are you out here?" asked Harry after a minute.

"No real reason," said Cedric, shrugging. "Nothing as good as your reason, I mean."

Harry just waited, content to let Cedric talk in his own time.

"I'm a second year," said Cedric after a few seconds of silence. "And I should be thrilled to be going back to Hogwarts, but I'm not."

"Why not?" asked Harry, intrigued. The more Cedric talked, the more Harry could see the truth of his words. He seemed cheerful and friendly on the surface, but something about the way he carried himself spoke of a kind of calm apathy that Harry recognized. He knew what it was like to not be excited to be somewhere.

Cedric frowned, deep in thought. "You know, I'm not exactly sure."

"No friends?"

"No, plenty of friends." Cedric threw his thumb over his shoulder at the compartment he'd just vacated. "Or plenty of people I'm friendly with in my year."

"That's not really the same thing."

"I guess," said Cedric absently. "I'm just…missing something. You know, I thought Hogwarts would be more magical than magical, if you get my drift. My friends are fine. The castle is fine. The classes are fine. It would just be nice if I had some…" Cedric trailed off, struggling for words.

"Excitement?" supplied Harry. "Adventure? Really wild things?"

"Yes," said Cedric, snapping his fingers. "That's it exactly. Where did you hear that?"

"Oh, it's from…" Harry frowned. Whatever he'd been about to say, it just… wasn't there. "A book," he finished. Except that wasn't quite right. It was from a book, but it was someone's favorite book, a book Harry had read a dozen times and he had no idea what it was.

Harry shivered.

It was the most disconcerting thing. It was like trying to remember a dream; he could tell it was there, just out of reach, could even see the shape of it. Reading, turning the pages…but it slipped out of reach.

"…Okay," said Cedric, oblivious to the byplay, but aware that Harry had stopped talking.

"It's just, I forget which book," said Harry. He hesitated, unsure whether or not to tell Cedric about the odd way his memory had been playing with him recently, when the door to the next carriage opened and a tall, somewhat stocky redhead wearing a loose burgundy sweater came in. He was carrying a pouch that clinked as he ambled over to them.

"Hey, Cedric," said the redhead. "Just making the rounds." He held up the bag and jingled it. "Fancy a flutter this year?"

"I'll pass, thanks," said Cedric dryly. He turned to Harry. "Harry, this is…" he trailed off, looking at the redhead expectantly.

The redhead grinned, a look that should have been accompanied by bells and a siren. "George Weasley." He looked at Harry appraisingly. "Say, you wouldn't be interested in getting in on a little pool the lower years have going? It's kind of a Hogwarts tradition."

Cedric coughed politely. "That you started last year."

"I said kind of."

"A pool on what?" asked Harry.

"On what happens to the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor," said George briskly. "Hogwarts hasn't been able to keep a steady one for a few decades. Some people say the job's jinxed. A few just retire or quit for some reason, but most of the time there's a pretty spectacular accident. Like last year, when Professor Slinkhard was transfiguring decorations for the end-of-term feast, and Peeves snuck up behind him with that wind horn Muggle gadget – "

"I think it's called an air horn," murmured Cedric.

" – and he's still at St. Mungo's with pumpkins for feet, I heard," finished George.

"Huh," said Harry. Several important questions occurred to him, but he found himself asking something else. "How much does it take to get in, and what are the popular picks?"

"Excellent," said George cheerfully. He whipped out a small black book and started flipping through pages. "Let's see, here... 'Poisoned by Snape' is always good odds." He glanced up at Harry. "You might also want to try one of the various forms of creature attack… hang on." His eyes wandered to Harry's forehead. "Are you…?"

"Caught on, have you?" Cedric rolled his eyes.

"Harry Potter?" George snapped the book shut as Harry resignedly nodded. "Well, that changes everything. We're going to have to re-figure some of these odds, maybe add a pick or two…"

And, muttering to himself, George walked down the hallway and into the next carriage.

"That was odd," said Harry.

"You don't know the half of it, mate," said Cedric. His lips twitched into a half-smile. "Literally."

"I take it he's a friend of yours?"

"Friend, friendly acquaintance," said Cedric. "We're in the same year but different Houses. He and his twin brother are in Gryffindor, I'm in Hufflepuff."

"Hufflepuff," said Harry. "I kind of thought Hagrid was kidding about that name."

Cedric frowned. "Don't tell me you're one of those kids who thinks Hufflepuffs are a load of duffers before you set one foot inside Hogwarts."

Harry held up his hands, protesting. "Hey, I don't pre-judge. What I know about Hogwarts you could fit on a postcard. A small postcard. But you have to admit, you're kind of starting off at a disadvantage with a name like Hufflepuff. Sounds like what a little girl would call her stuffed penguin."

Cedric chuckled, but as he trailed off he fixed Harry with a sober look. "You grew up Muggle, didn't you?"

Harry crossed his arms. "Is that a problem?"

"Not for me, and not for most people. But a lot of Muggle-raised kids make the same mistake when they come to Hogwarts. They see all the differences, all the strange things wizards do, and they immediately start pointing out how daft some of them are compared to Muggles."

"So you're saying I should try not to laugh when people say things like 'Hufflepuff,' or 'Hogwarts,' or 'Fizzing Whizzbee'?"

"Always thought that last one was a bit much, but, yeah, for the most part." Cedric spread his hands. "Look, all I'm saying is that you wouldn't go over to a friend's house and immediately start talking about how your parents' house did things better and had better things. It's just bad manners."

"I don't know, Cedric," said Harry, frowning. "I've never really been a big fan of manners. I'm more of a 'speak the truth and let the chips fall where they may,' kind of guy."

Cedric seemed to consider this, then grinned. "Sounds like this year will be less boring, at least. Just don't say I didn't warn you when you're being pelted by falling chips."

As he finished speaking, there was a loud bang as the carriage door opened and a redhead dashed in who looked identical to George Weasley, but with a garish yellow sweater that clashed horribly with his hair instead of a burgundy one.

"George just told me the news!" he exclaimed as he rushed up to them. "Say, Harry, do you think it's likely that a professor demonstrating counter-curses could set off a traumatic flashback that unlocks your hidden powers and makes you accidentally vaporize him?"

"Uh, can't say that I do."

"Well, let me know if you change your mind. There could be good money in it," said the redhead. He turned and noticed Cedric. "Cedric! Good to see you, mate. Still going to try out for Quidditch this term?"

"That's the plan," said Cedric.

"Oh, sorry, Harry. I'm Fred Weasley." The redhead reached out to shake Harry's hand, and Harry took it, feeling like he was caught up in a conversational tornado. "Anyway, must dash. Lee said Terence Higgs is giving him five-to-one that the new Defense professor makes it to Easter."

And with that, he scampered down the hallway and into the next carriage.

"Are they always like that?" asked Harry.

"Pretty much, yeah. The Weasleys are a big family, and I live near them so I've been over a few times. It's a bit… well, it's never quiet, that's for sure."

"And what was that about Quidditch?"

Cedric's eyes widened. "I forgot – you wouldn't know what that was, would you? It's a game, played on broomsticks, and it's loads of fun. Every House has a team."

"How do you play?"

"It's kind of complicated. There's four balls, and – you know what, I'll tell you later. Let's find someplace to sit. It's kind of a longer conversation than standing in a hallway calls for."

What surprised Harry the most was that he didn't doubt it for a moment: at some point, Cedric would tell him about Quidditch. And just like that, Harry felt some of his general apprehension and nervousness about going to school fade away.

"Do you want to check out my compartment?" asked Harry. "It's all new students, and they're probably done freaking out about, you know." He gestured to his forehead.

"Sure, that sounds – " Cedric was interrupted as one of the nearby compartment doors opened, then slammed forcefully shut, a girl moving into the hallway in the intermediate time. She was shorter than Harry, with dark brown eyes and mousey brown hair. She was scowling as she made a rude gesture at someone back in the compartment. Harry and Cedric looked at each other; a shrug, a nod, a question, an answer all in about half a second, then walked over to the girl.

"...stupid, prissy, stuck-up, bigot. And your hair is awful!" shouted the girl, scowling at a girl with curly red-blonde hair, still in the compartment.

"Something I can help with, miss?" asked Harry. "Don't worry, I'm a prefect."

Cedric did a double-take, staring hard at Harry, but stayed silent.

The girl was gulping in air for another blast of vitriol, but when she heard Harry and Cedric approach, she turned and fixed Harry with a glare.

"No, you're not. You look like you're nine."

Harry suppressed a scowl. It wasn't his fault he hadn't hit a growth spurt, well, ever. He schooled his features into a pleasant grin. "Well, maybe I'm not a prefect, but I do happen to be a prefect-lygood listener."

The girl's eyes narrowed, but her mouth quirked into a smile. "That's not very funny," she said unconvincingly.

"You're not shouting anymore, though," observed Harry. Internally, he experienced a moment of panic. The prefect joke had just…been there. Popped into his head, for no reason he could think of.

"Okay, it was a little funny," said the girl.

Cedric craned his neck, looking into the compartment. "That girl seems to be making some pretty emphatic hand gestures at you. Is this going to get ugly?"

"She's all talk," said the girl with a derisive snort.

"What did she do to you, anyway?" asked Harry.

"Oh, Marietta was just saying some very unkind things about Muggle-borns, and she was being so snotty about it that I just wanted to yank her stupid curly hair out. I'm Katie, by the way. Katie Bell."

"Well, Katie, Cedric and I were just about to head back to my compartment, where there's a girl who seems to be okay with Muggle-borns, and has much nicer hair than that one," said Harry, gesturing at Marietta. "You're welcome to join us."

"All right," said Katie, shrugging. "I really was trying to make friends, and Mum did tell me to work on my temper, but it's so hard when I'm not flying, and it makes me feel better to punch the occasional loudmouth, although usually it's a boy that I have to punch. It's going to be so hard this year, not flying, I might actually die. Isn't it so unfair that first years can't bring their brooms? Oh, and who are you, anyway?"

She said the last part to Harry, focusing on him, and Cedric took the opportunity to slowly inch away.

Harry was saved from identifying himself as the carriage door burst open and a redhead who looked exactly like George and Fred Weasley except wearing a very loud lime green sweater walked briskly in, sauntering over to them.

"Ah, Harry, there you are. My brothers were just catching me up. You'll be happy to know that we already have a few bets that you'll challenge the new Defense professor to a duel when you realize that he's not as good a spellcaster as you, and then he'll quit out of embarrassment when you beat him."

Harry closed his eyes. "You do realize I don't know anything about magic, right? People can't possibly expect me to be any better or worse than an average first year. That would be wrong on so many levels."

"Well, those are the breaks," grinned the redhead. "And let me add that it's a real honor to make your acquaintance. Eustis Weasley, at your service."

Cedric gave the redhead a flat stare, shaking his head. The redhead just grinned.

"Uh, thank you?" said Harry.

"You're quite welcome. And look! You've attracted your first female admirer." The redhead bowed to Katie. "Ah, well. I suppose it was inevitable. See you later, Harry!" And with that, he practically ran down the hallway and into the next carriage.

Harry turned to Cedric expectantly.

"They're messing with you," said Cedric. "There are only two of them." He rubbed the bridge of his nose. "I think."

"Let's go to my compartment," said Harry. "If we stay out here too much longer, something really weird might happen."

Harry's conception of his compartment as a safe haven of normalcy was dashed when the three of them returned to find Cho and Zacharias sharing identical looks of fascinated nausea as Vaisey and Cormac pontificated on the wonders of Marmite, apparently finding a point of common interest that bridged the gap between Muggle-born and Wizard-born.

Cho sighed when she saw Harry, by all appearances quite relieved to never hear another word of that particular conversation. What threw Harry a little off balance, though, was the snowy owl perched on her wrist. Cho had a sandwich balanced on her knee, and seemed to be in the middle of feeding Hedwig bits of turkey from it.

"Er, sorry, Harry," said Cho. "I wanted to check with you to see if it was okay, but you weren't here, and your owl seemed to be really unhappy in her cage, and she was eyeing my sandwich, and she's so beautiful, and she seems to be happy now, I think…" Cho looked at Hedwig, who gave Harry a look of smug superiority.

"It's fine," said Harry. "Just don't feed her too much. She's quite greedy, you know." Hedwig tilted her head, made an indignant whistle-bark sound, and looked like she'd cuff him with her wing if she could be bothered to move at that particular moment.

Harry turned to the rest of the compartment. "Would you guys make some room? I brought a few people."

Cho, who seemed cheered by the addition of Katie, was quick to make room. Introductions were made all around, and after Katie had threatened to punch him in the face for not telling her that he was Harry Potter, of all people, the six first-years plus Cedric settled in to talk.

Seven people being just about the number where it's impossible to hold a single conversation, the talk quickly devolved into three or four separate threads. Harry was happy to sit back and listen to Cho tell him about her pet cat she'd left at home because she was afraid her parents would miss him, while also keeping an ear on Katie and the boys as they argued about which House they'd be in.

"Hufflepuff?" said Cormac. "I don't know why anyone would want to get Sorted there."

"I'm in Hufflepuff," said Cedric, looking unruffled. "You could do worse. They're a friendly bunch."

"Yeah, a friendly bunch of losers," said Cormac. "First in friendship, fourth in points, that's what my uncle says."

"Excuse me," said Zacharias coldly. "My whole family was in Hufflepuff, and the Smiths are descended from Helga herself. Are you saying I'm a loser?"

Cormac looked around for support, saw none, and backtracked hard. "Well, maybe not you. There are probably decent blokes in Hufflepuff. My uncle Tiberius works at the Ministry, and he says they don't hire a lot of Hufflepuffs for the important positions…" Cormac trailed off, blushing. "He's kind of old, though," he muttered, as if excusing him.

There was an awkward moment of silence, which Vaisey broke. "Personally, I'm hoping for Slytherin. I wouldn't mind going anywhere, really, but I've heard Slytherin has the best Quidditch team, and Quidditch sounds amazing."

The argument that followed was very heated and involved a lot of shouting. At the end, Harry still didn't understand Quidditch but reckoned that anything that inspired that much passion was likely pretty entertaining. The Quidditch discussion dovetailed into a more sedate, but still interesting conversation about classes and spells.

Cedric was demonstrating a few of the spells they'd learn in first year, and seemed to fall quite naturally into the role of the teacher, seemingly unaffected by the spotlight of rapt attention.

"…and this one's actually a second-year spell, but I did a bit of reading over the summer, and I think I've got it down…" Cedric grinned cheekily. "Just hold that still, would you?" He gestured at the half-eaten sandwich still perched on Cho's knee. He twirled his wand in a tight circle. "Engorgio!"

Unfortunately, Cedric's aim was a bit off. Also unfortunately, Cho was still holding Harry's owl. The narrow, blue beam of light struck Hedwig directly, and there were at least three sets of screams as the snowy owl swelled to the size of a panda.

Only Cho's flailing arms were visible beneath Hedwig, who was now large enough that her head was squished against the top of the compartment. She fixed Cedric with a terrifyingly affronted stare, and her outraged "HOOT" was loud enough to rattle the windows.

"Reducio!" Cedric's voice was noticeably higher-pitched as he swept his wand in a quick V-shape, the beam striking true. Hedwig promptly shrunk to her usual size, though the furious glare she was sporting at Cedric remained quite heated.

"Sorry," muttered Cedric, grinning weakly. "Wand got a bit overexcited there."

"I bet you say that to all the girls," said Harry.

Cho was dusting herself off, smoothing Hedwig's feathers, and matching her glare for glare at Cedric. Katie Bell asked if you could do that spell just on someone's head, and the rest of the boys looked at her oddly.

Harry paid no attention, sinking into his seat. He was having another moment. That last comment to Cedric had felt natural, and yet Harry didn't even understand it. It had just felt right to say, like something he'd done forever. He felt like he needed a quiet hour or two to sort it all out, but he wasn't even sure that would work, because the more he thought about it, the more it seemed to slip out of his grasp.

There was a knock on the compartment door. An older, somewhat squat witch with grey hair and kind features opened the door and peered inside. "Anything off the trolley, dears?"

Cedric was already reaching into his pocket. "Two Cauldron Cakes, please. And Harry, if you want anything for your owl, it's on me."

"How do you know what they have?" asked Cho.

Cedric waved his hand dismissively. "Oh, they have the same thing every time."

Harry went completely still. Cedric's words bounced around his head until he could sort through it enough to put it into a coherent thought. And that thought was:

Breakfast.

That was what his brain had been trying to tell him. His memory of breakfast wasn't poking him because it was odd. Rather, it was because it was not odd. Harry flipped through his memories, recalling countless mornings making breakfast for his aunt and uncle and cousin. The same, all of them. Not similar. Not just the same food. The same memory.

Harry sat there, letting the sounds of the compartment wash over him as everyone chatted amicably about what treats they were going to buy. He felt cold.

About an hour ago, he'd resolved to learn everything he could as fast as possible. He was pretty sure he knew what he was going to start with.



* * *



Hogwarts was more impressive the closer you got, which was saying something. The boat ride across the lake with Cho and Katie had gone swimmingly (though thankfully without any actual swimming). His first view of the castle was something Harry would always remember. His heart had clenched, and then unclenched, like he was coming home.

The corridors and medieval architecture were fascinating, and the flagged stone floor of the Entrance Hall went perfectly with the flaming torches on the wall, not to mention the ghosts that floated up through the floor.

Harry was looking everywhere at once, trying to soak it all in. He was barely listening as the Deputy Headmistress, a stern-looking woman named McGonagall, explained the Sorting and the House system. He'd picked up most of it in conversations on the train, anyway. Cho was walking next to him, not quite as wide-eyed but still looking everywhere.

After McGonagall left them in a little side-room in the Entrance Hall, telling them in no uncertain terms to wait quietly until it was time to be Sorted, Harry found himself thinking about the Houses. He'd never really considered where he'd like to go, and even though most people seemed to put great stock in the question, he found he didn't have much of a preference. He was going to study, and learn magic, and make friends, and investigate his memory problem, and he could do that anywhere.

Now that he thought of it, though, he wouldn't mind being a Hufflepuff. Lowering expectations seemed like a good idea, given what he'd experienced in the wizarding world so far, and he'd felt a kinship with Cedric.

"Do you know where you want to go, Cho?" he said quietly to the girl beside him.

"My parents expect I'll be in Ravenclaw," she said tersely. She was looking at the door in front of them, foot tapping the stone floor nervously.

Harry noticed she hadn't really answered the question.

Before he could probe further, the double doors opened and McGonagall waved them inside. The sound of hundreds of voices filled the air.

The Great Hall rivaled his first look at the castle for sheer wonder. Literally thousands of hovering candles caught the eye at first glance, but one's gaze was inevitably drawn to the ceiling. It was velvet black, streaked with grey, wispy clouds, and bright stars that outshone the candles. It was so breathtaking that Harry thought for a second that the giant room was simply open to the air.

If this was what magic could do, thought Harry, he could get very used to it indeed.

It was a bit unsettling to stand near the front of the room with a couple hundred older children, faces framed in candlelight, looking at you, so Harry focused on standing tall and looking placid as the Sorting was musically explained by a talking hat.

McGonagall stepped forward holding a long scroll and began calling names, and just like that, their futures were decided.

"Aldermaston, Patrick!"

A pudgy kid with a pug nose who reminded Harry a little of Dudley approached the Sorting Hat and tentatively lifted it onto his head.

The entire room was quiet, only a few coughs and scuffing of chairs marring the silence. Harry shifted from foot to foot. It wasn't exactly gripping theater.

After a minute that felt like ten, the Hat opened its 'mouth' and shouted "GRYFFINDOR!"

The room burst into applause, particularly from the red and gold table. Harry saw Fred and George clapping enthusiastically, and didn't see anyone who looked like them, so felt safe in assuming the whole triplets thing had been a joke. Those two struck him as the kind of people where you never really could be sure, though.

"Bell, Katie!"

Katie bounded up to the Hat, fearless. This time, the Hat spent only about ten seconds doing whatever it did before yelling "GRYFFINDOR!" Katie turned back to them, waved at Cho and Harry, and went to join the red and gold.

Miles Bletchley joined the Slytherins, who looked a hard bunch, even in the candlelight. Eddie Carmichael became the first Ravenclaw, and the blue and bronze table clapped a bit more sedately, but willingly enough, and then…

"Chang, Cho!" The dark-haired girl next to him grabbed Harry's hand and gave it a quick squeeze, then approached the Hat. Harry watched, fascinated, as Cho closed her eyes with the Hat on her head, her lips moving imperceptibly. It was almost like she was having a conversation.

Cho's Sorting stretched on, and Harry was starting to get a bit nervous, but finally the Hat shouted "RAVENCLAW!" and Cho hopped off the stool, her face unreadable.

Harry missed the next few names. He was looking between the tables. He watched Cedric welcome a new Hufflepuff, saw Cho slide in next to an older Ravenclaw, and Katie start chatting with the Weasley twins at the Gryffindor table. He sighed. Well, it had been a nice fantasy, anyway. He'd have to add "inter-house activities" to the research list.

"McLaggen, Cormac!" Harry looked up as the larger boy swaggered to the stage. He wasn't quite sure what to make of Cormac, but all things being equal, he'd just assume not share a dormitory with the kid, whose defining trait based on six hours in a train compartment seemed to be "loud."

The Hat had barely touched Cormac's head before it shouted "GRYFFINDOR!"

Yes, thought Harry. Definitely Hufflepuff for me. Katie Bell and her humorous, good-natured violence would have to fend for herself.

Harry felt curiously lackluster as the names crept closer to his own. What was the point of splitting everyone up at age eleven, anyway? Mindful of Cedric's advice, he resolved to not immediately say that Houses were stupid. At least not on his first day. Or without doing some research.

"Potter, Harry!" McGonagall's crisp voice cut through his musing, and Harry looked up.

Everyone was staring at him. He heard his own name run laps around the room, repeated in whispers. From a little down the line, Mike Vaisey gave him a tentative thumbs-up.

Harry blew out a breath, walked to the stool, and shoved the Hat on his head.

It was a curious sensation. The voices of the Hall dropped away to a buzz, and a small voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere spoke in his ear.

"Well, this is a problem."

And that was all. Harry shuffled on the stool. Feeling foolish, he closed his eyes and thought, uh, hello? Anyone there?

"Be quiet, Mr. Potter," said the small voice. "I'm thinking."

The Hat lapsed into silence again. Harry waited. He couldn't hear anything; either the magic around the Hat took a while to kick in completely, or the Hall had gone silent. He felt a kind of breathless anticipation.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said the Hat. "Your mind is…not all there. No, no," it said, picking up on Harry's dismay. "I don't mean you're damaged or mentally ill or anything like that. I mean your mind, your memories, literally aren't all there. I can see that you've been struggling with this yourself. I wish I could offer you an answer, but I cannot. Whoever did this to you guarded specifically against the way in which I examine your mind… and I will leave you to draw your own conclusion about that."

So can you Sort me or not?

"Curious. You don't appear to be overly worried about the possibility that I cannot."

If you can't, I'll figure something out.

"Yes, you are quite resolved, aren't you?" said the Hat. Its voice had a quality of…tasting, or measuring. "That does indeed seem to be your most defining quality. You, Mr. Potter, are implacable. When the trumpet sounds, when the lines are drawn, you will rush in where angels fear to tread."

Harry could see where this was going, and his thoughts took a panicky turn. Wait, don't I get a say in –

"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the Hat.



* * *



Harry couldn't sleep. The four-poster had deep-red velvet curtains, and was unquestionably the finest bed Harry had ever slept in… that he could remember, at least.

And therein lay the problem.

It was a strange and horrifying thing, not to be able to trust his own mind. Harry didn't know what magic could do, but he was pretty sure Hagrid had mentioned a whole department of the Ministry of Magic dedicated to modifying people's memories. And that was terrifying.

He had to know. He had to know what someone could do to a mind, if it could be fought, or detected, or reversed, and he had to figure it all out without tipping off the person who'd done it, who could be literally anyone with a wand, lest they catch on and finish the job. Discretion was his only advantage.

Harry sighed and sat up in bed, opening the curtain. He could see grey light filtering in through the windows, though he had no idea what time it was. He'd have to add that to the list: buy a watch. Harry assumed there wasn't an easy magical method of telling time, since he'd seen plenty of students on the train with watches.

He vaguely remembered the Gryffindor Prefect who'd led them to the common room, a tall, dour-looking blond named Vogler, mention something about curfew, but he didn't recall any restriction on when one could get up.

Padding quietly out of bed, Harry dressed, taking care to make as little noise as possible – though it was hardly necessary with Cormac snoring up a storm.

The Gryffindor common room was empty and lifeless, though the fireplace crackled merrily. Harry opened the portrait hole and climbed out.

The castle was still and quiet. Despite his forewarning to take note of where he was, he was lost within minutes. But since he wasn't trying to be anywhere in particular, he was unperturbed.

Portraits watched him, their silent eyes following him as he explored the empty hallways, and he could have sworn one of the suits of armor turned its head to follow him.

Harry was just starting to consider trying to look for something specific, namely the library, when something caught his eye. He'd been walking down a hallway a few floors below Gryffindor Tower, poking his head into the various doorways, which seemed to be mostly disused and dusty classrooms. But the last door in the hallway was actually protruding from the wall, like someone had propped up a freestanding doorway flush with the wall.

Standing in front of it, it looked exactly like the other doors in the hallway, but when Harry twisted the doorknob and pulled, it opened onto the hallway's stone wall.

Blinking, Harry moved back and examined it. A doorway to nothing seemed to fit the general spirit of what he'd seen of the castle so far, but surely there had to be some reason for it. He moved to the side and saw that the hinges seemed to be supported by air; attached to nothing. Yet when Harry tried to budge the door, it refused to move.

After a few minutes' investigation turned up nothing, Harry resorted to angrily swinging the door open. Instead of bouncing off the wall, it stayed there, fully open, snapping into place with an audible click.

Harry was bemused, but undaunted. He stepped back. He looked at the door from every angle. He even got up close to the wall and tried to see what the door had stuck to when it opened.

And that was when he noticed, quite accidentally, that the hallway seemed to have sprouted an extra door.

Harry slowly stepped back. He was sure there had been six doorways, counting this one that led nowhere, but now there were unquestionably seven. With mounting excitement, he scurried forward and started opening them again.

Disused classroom, disused classroom, disused classroom…

Disused classroom with a giant mirror inside. Harry slowly entered the room, his eyes on the huge object sitting in the center.

The mirror was gigantic, stretching almost to the ceiling. Yet it was very beautiful, with an ornate gold frame and two gently curving clawed feet. Written across the top, engraved on the gold, was an inscription in an elegant scrawl.

Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.

Harry approached the mirror…

…and nearly jumped out of his skin.

His own image looked back at him, and surrounding him was a crowd of vague, ominous black shapes, people-sized shadows standing still as statues.

Reviews, as always, are very much appreciated.





3. Chapter 3

Author's Note: Chapter 1 has been revised. Vaisey hit too many cliche alerts (although to everyone pointing out that he's an OC, go check the dramatis personae for Half-Blood Prince; he's actually a canon character) and has been (hopefully) toned down from "ragequit the story" annoying to "normal 11-year old" annoying. I appreciate the feedback - it honestly makes the story better.

Chapter 2 – The Nature of Hufflepuffs

Cedric Diggory sat on a bench in the Great Hall and thought about breakfast.

This was not at all odd, given the fact that Cedric was, at the moment, participating in that very activity. September 2nd happened to be a Sunday, and that meant everyone got one glorious day before classes started, the result of which being a breakfast that was long and lingering. It seemed no one was eager to start the day, and the steady buzz of conversation in the Hall had a light, cheerful energy.

Also on Cedric's mind, besides breakfast, were Quidditch tryouts. He'd practiced hard over the summer, and though he knew it was a long shot, he harbored a not-so-secret desire to be Hufflepuff's Seeker. Gabriel Truman, the team's current Seeker, hadn't caught the Snitch once last year. Cedric was trying to tamp down his excitement – second years hardly ever made House teams, and Truman wasn't bad, exactly – and having only moderate success.

And finally, Cedric was thinking about Harry Potter. It was a secondary, idle thought, but it was there. Harry was a bit of a puzzle. On the one hand, Cedric felt like he'd connected with Harry more in one train ride than he had with his housemates in a whole school year. On the other, Harry was…odd. For someone who ostensibly grew up in the Muggle world, Harry sometimes seemed awfully relaxed and confident joking about brand-new things. Then again, sometimes he didn't.

As if his thoughts had summoned him, Cedric became aware that Harry had entered the Hall. Cedric was facing away from the entrance the Gryffindors used, but it was easy enough to tell. The energy in the Hall changed. Cedric saw several of his housemates craning their necks, staring, and he heard Harry's name in dozens of fragments of conversation.

Cedric looked over his shoulder, and in the space of a few seconds the "puzzle" aspect of Harry reared its head. Harry was walking into the Hall, seemingly impervious to the attention, his body language calm and relaxed, even his walk smooth and quiet. And then from one moment to the next, he was tense, looking around while obviously trying to be subtle about it, so clearly and gracelessly eleven that Cedric was almost convinced that he'd imagined those first few moments. But he hadn't.

He waved at Harry, catching his eye, motioning him over. Cedric turned to the third-year Hufflepuff next to him. "Budge up."

Harry Potter plopped down onto the bench beside Cedric, elbows slumping on the table.

"Hey, Harry. Cutting it a bit close – breakfast is nearly over," said Cedric.

"It's okay, I'm not very hungry," said Harry, scowling down at the food as if personally offended by it.

"You feeling all right?" asked Cedric, glancing over at the younger boy. "You look a bit peaky."

Harry took a while to answer. "I didn't sleep well," he said at last.

Cedric took a moment to chew his food. "The first night can be tough," he said. "I remember my first night here. I was really excited by Hogwarts and everything, but it's kind of scary and sad to leave home."

Harry looked at him, quickly shook his head. "That's definitely not it." He started loading his plate with food, scowling all the while.

Cedric filed that bit of information away. Unhappy home life, got it. He was about to apologize for bringing it up when Zacharias Smith leaned forward from a few places down the bench and fixed Harry with a haughty stare that he couldn't quite pull off.

"What are you doing here, anyway? This is the Hufflepuff table."

The reaction of the table to Smith's words was interesting. Cedric had already noticed the strange, double-sided nature of his House: an exclusive inclusivity. Hufflepuff was no more immune to House pride and rivalry than any of the others, but their mandate of hard work, loyalty and friendship made them almost aggressively try to be the most welcoming House. Sometimes. Which is why it was interesting that, at a glance, about a third of the table was looking at Smith with disapproval, another third with annoyance, and the last third like they agreed with him but weren't going to say anything about it.

"I'm having breakfast," said Harry. "What's the problem?"

"Leave it alone, Smith," said Cedric over Zacharias's protests. "I invited him."

That seemed to be enough to forestall any comments, but Cedric didn't miss the undercurrent of tension that hung around. Another feature of Hufflepuff was that, as a whole, they were fairly resistant to change, especially disruptive change.

"People seem to take the whole House thing pretty seriously," said Harry. Then, for no reason Cedric could think of, Harry winced, like he'd said something wrong and was waiting for the fallout.

"That's an understatement," said Cedric.

Harry pushed some food around on his plate. "So is this where you tell me that I should not say whatever I think about how good or bad the House system is until I know what I'm talking about?"

"You remembered," said Cedric, a little bit touched. "And yes, I wouldn't mouth off about Houses just yet. You're kind of stuck with them, and they're set up so that they're important. You'll spend more time with the Gryffindor first year boys than with everyone else combined, probably."

Harry scowled. "Great." He looked over his shoulder at the Gryffindor table, then back to Cedric. "Does this mean we can't, you know… hang out?"

He said it with such a strange combination of bravado and vulnerability that Cedric burst out laughing. "No, no," he said at Harry's offended look. "I wasn't laughing at you. You're just very, I don't know, direct." Harry just stared at him. "We can hang out," said Cedric, hoping that would clear things up.

Harry nodded, going back to his breakfast. They were both quiet for a few minutes. Cedric was just putting the finishing touches on a decent-sized ball of anxiety over Quidditch tryouts when Harry got his attention.

He was pointing to the High Table. "Who's that?" Cedric followed where he was pointing.

"The Headmaster? You didn't hear him speak last night at the Sorting?"

Harry grinned sheepishly. "Wasn't really listening."

"I've been there," said Cedric. "I don't think I heard one word from when we stepped into the Hall to when McGonagall called 'Diggory'."

Harry was staring at the High Table, his eyes narrowing. "He's familiar."

Cedric tapped the side of his cup thoughtfully. "I don't see how that could be. You were raised Muggle, and Aberforth Dumbledore is about as wizardly as wizards get."

"Tell me about him." Harry's eyes hadn't left the High Table.

"Well," said Cedric, struggling to remember the bits and pieces he'd picked up last year, and what his parents had told him. "He's been Headmaster for about a decade, and he taught Care of Magical Creatures before that. That reminds me, actually, whatever you do, do not mention anything about goats in his presence, ever."

Harry finally broke his gaze from the High Table and looked at Cedric, bemused. "Huh?"

"Something I heard from one of the upper forms. He said he'd tell me why when I was older. But last year the Weasley twins charmed all the salt shakers on the High Table to make goat noises at the Headmaster during the Leaving Feast, and I think their detentions actually carried over to this year."

Harry looked across the room to where Fred and George were playing "celery walrus teeth" for the amusement of the Gryffindor table. "Yeah, they seem like the type."

"Anyway, aside from the goat thing, he's a really powerful wizard. He dueled his own brother and Grindelwald long enough get Albus to see the light. And then the two of them took Grindelwald down together, or at least that's how the story goes."

Harry was looking back at the High Table, a faraway expression on his face. "Grindelwald was a Dark wizard?"

"A bad one," said Cedric. "I don't know much about him. It was almost fifty years ago, but it was a big deal. Even the Muggles got involved, I think. You could look it up in the library."

"Oh, I think I'll be looking up a lot of stuff in the library," said Harry softly. "So he's powerful. What else?"

"I… don't really know," said Cedric. Aberforth Dumbledore was old and powerful and an authority figure. It had never really occurred to him until this moment that he was also a person. It felt a bit strange, like wondering if Professor Sprout had ever been married, or what color her curtains were.

"What about the brother? Albus?"

"Him I know something about," said Cedric. "My dad's in the Ministry, and he had a few run-ins with Albus over the merpeople living in the Black Lake back when Albus was Headmaster. My dad says he's a stubborn, crazy old codger, but a lot of people really respected him."

Harry didn't miss the phrasing. "And they don't anymore?"

Cedric shifted in his seat nervously. "Something to do with the war against You-Know-Who. No one really likes to talk about it, especially my parents. All I know is that right after You-Know-Who vanished, Albus Dumbledore went from being the best hope for England, to losing his positions at Hogwarts and on the Wizengamot. I think he was even formally banned from England. No one's seen him since he left, but you still hear his name sometimes because he's the head of the ICW."

"ICW?" asked Harry.

"It's, uh, this group of international wizards, in some kind of… confederation…" Cedric trailed off, then blushed. "You could probably – "

Harry grinned. "Library. Got it."

Cedric fought down a sense of irritation. He tried to listen when his dad pontificated about the Ministry, but it was dreadfully dull, and Cedric hadn't been exaggerating when he'd told Harry on the train that his life could use a bit of excitement. To be twelve years old and bored was a terrible thing.

They were both quiet again, and Cedric let the noises of the Great Hall wash over him. He looked up at the enchanted ceiling – overcast sky today. A group of Slytherins, tight-knit and scowling, stood up and headed towards the dungeons. At the Slytherin table, Cedric saw Mike Vaisey eating by himself, looking a bit shell-shocked. Cedric hoped he was tough; life wasn't easy for a Muggle-born in Slytherin. Across the room, Penelope Clearwater was giving an impromptu lecture on basic Arithmancy to a group of rapt first-year Ravenclaws. He spied the girl from Harry's compartment, Cho Chang, among them. Just another morning at Hogwarts.

Harry was staring at the High Table again. "What about the rest of them? I remember McGonagall from last night, but that's it."

Cedric gestured with his fork. "Professor Flitwick, Charms. That's Professor Sprout next to him, she's Head of Hufflepuff. Professor Vector, Arithmancy. That's Professor Snape on the other side of the Headmaster; he teaches Potions and he's… not fun. Next to him… huh." Cedric squinted, getting a better look at the man. He ate very stiffly, his hair wispy and white and covered by a moth-eaten fez. His face and hands were pockmarked, the skin around the scars carrying a faint greenish tinge. But the most interesting thing about him was the fact that, standing discreetly behind him, a man and a woman in dark Auror robes stood, still as statues but very alert, quite obviously with their attention focused on the white-haired man.

"That's Elphias Doge," said Cedric. "He wasn't at the Feast last night. What's he doing here?"

"He's a famous wizard?" asked Harry, who seemed to have entirely forgotten the food in front of him.

"More like infamous. He's a criminal, I think. He had a big trial in front of the Wizengamot. He was part of the Order, and they're bad news. I can't believe he's in the same room as the Headmaster. Maybe that's what the Aurors are for?"

Harry shook his head. "Cedric, you just used a bunch of words that I don't understand. Do you think you could back up and – "

"Hey, Potter, what are you doing over here?" A voice cut into their conversation, and Cedric looked over his shoulder and saw Cormac McLaggen sweeping his gaze over the Hufflepuff table with disdain.

Cedric saw Zacharias Smith return the look with interest, and noted with half amusement and half sadness that it wouldn't be the first budding friendship destroyed by the House system.

As Harry turned to reply, his expression scathing, Cedric nudged him, and as Harry looked his way, he shook his head fractionally.

"Just talking to Cedric," said Harry, his voice controlled.

"Well, you should come back to our table," said Cormac. "People are gonna start to wonder."

"Sure," said Harry, swinging his legs over the bench and standing. He glanced at Cedric. "We'll catch up later?"

"Okay," said Cedric, nodding.

He watched as Harry and Cormac started walking over to the Gryffindor table. About halfway there, as Cormac kept talking, Harry's expression got more and drawn in until he abruptly turned and walked away, leaving a baffled-looking Cormac standing in the middle of the Hall as Harry slid into place at the Ravenclaw table next to Cho Chang, an easy grin on his face as he started chatting with her.

It's a puzzle, thought Cedric.



* * *



The golden ball flickered at the edge of his vision as Cedric swung his broom down and to the left, cutting viciously through the air, his hand stretching, sweeping…

And gone. He clenched his teeth, pulling up and looking around. He accelerated, the wind whipping at his hair as he rose above the pitch, his gaze darting from place to place.

There.

The Snitch hovered close to the ground at the far end of the pitch. Cedric tore after it, arrow-straight. He approached at a shallow angle as it dipped and dived near the goalposts. Cedric tensed, watching for the bolt, that moment when the Snitch took off in a random direction.

When it came, he was ready, and he leaned forward, flat on his broom, following the Snitch as it shot straight up toward the middle hoop. He almost missed the moment when the Snitch swerved again, almost at a right angle, and when he veered to compensate, his foot clipped the outer edge of the hoop.

Cedric wobbled, his Cleansweep Seven shuddering with the impact. He fought to reorient himself. Even as he spun, he focused, his eyes seeking that glint of gold. Found it. He hauled the broom on target, leaned forward…

A whistle blew sharply, loudly.

"Ten minutes, Diggory. Come on down."

Heidi Macavoy's voice hit him like cold water, and he descended slowly. Near the middle of the pitch, a crowd of players in canary-yellow Quidditch robes watched. Gabriel Truman, his competition, was already celebrating. His girlfriend, a sixth-year whose hair was currently a shockingly bright purple, had her legs wrapped around Gabriel's waist and was kissing him soundly. Cedric didn't know Tonks well, but from what he'd seen, she wasn't one for subtlety.

"Sorry, Diggory," said Macavoy as Cedric touched down beside her. "Maybe next year."

"Yeah, sure." With a supreme effort, Cedric settled his features into an easygoing grin and stretched out his hand. The Hufflepuff Captain took it. "Thanks for considering me. Good luck this year."

"You're good, Diggory," she said. "Almost as good as Truman, and you're a second year. Keep at it." She pumped his hand a few times, released it, turned around and walked over to the rest of the Hufflepuff team.

Cedric allowed himself ten seconds to stand there and feel sorry for himself. Then he let out a long breath, mounted his broom, and zoomed up to the stands where Harry and Cho sat. The crowd of spectators was pretty thin for the Hufflepuff tryouts, and the three of them had the whole section to themselves.

"Bad luck," said Harry. "Truman's Snitch seemed a lot slower than yours."

Cho nodded distractedly, eagerly watching the Chaser tryouts taking place below. "It wasn't fair at all. Only giving you guys ten minutes, I think that's very random."

Privately, Cedric agreed. "It is what it is," he said.

"I thought you were brilliant," said Cho, finally averting her eyes from the pitch to glance at Cedric. She blushed. "I mean, your flying. I've been practicing since I was seven, and I'm not that good."

Cedric didn't quite know what to say to that, but Harry jumped in before the silence became too awkward.

"It looks really, really fun," said Harry. "Flying. It's the best thing I've seen since I've been here. Even after a few weeks of classes and magic and moving staircases, I think this is it. I mean, flying. Who doesn't dream about that?"

Cedric shook his head. No matter how much he kept reminding himself that Harry had grown up Muggle, it was still surprising. To think, there was an entire group of people – bigger than wizards, if what his dad told him was right – that didn't grow up with the idea that flying was something normal and common.

He held out his Cleansweep Seven. "Want a go?"

Harry took it, his eyes widening.

"I know you haven't had flying lessons yet, but it's honestly not hard. Broom does most of the work."

Standing, Harry swung his leg over the racing room. "There's something here. It feels soft."

"Brooms have a lot of charms and enchantments on them," said Cho excitedly. "You're feeling the Cushioning Charm. It was invented in 1820 by Elliot Smethwyck but it was really simple back then. It was only thirty years ago that they perfected the Auto-Adjustable part of the…" she trailed off, looking between the two boys. "What? I like Quidditch."

Cedric exchanged a look with Harry verifying that neither of them were going to say anything stupid.

"You going to try out next year?" asked Cedric.

"Yes." Cho sounded determined, but pulled into herself a bit when she said it.

"What position?"

"Seeker." The smile she gave him that time didn't come with a blush, and was a little bit scary.

Meanwhile, Harry had set himself up on Cedric's broom. He was hovering about a foot off the ground.

"It feels natural," was his only comment. He took another few seconds to settle himself into position. "Like all I need to do is lean forward and go."

Without waiting for a comment, he did so. Harry accelerated up and over the stands, then dove almost straight down. Cedric and Cho raced to the top of the stands, looking down, Cedric for a heart-stopping second thinking about how he'd have to explain to all the professors exactly how he'd handed Harry Potter the tools to break his own neck, but even as the scenario unfolded in his head, it was dashed as Harry climbed into their line of sight, shooting almost straight up at an extreme rate of speed, his whoop of joy trailing behind him.

In just a few seconds Cedric had to squint to make him out. He'd leveled off and was making for the Black Lake. Harry dove, and sped up into the dive, pulling up in a spray of water as he leaned to the side and trailed his arm beneath him.

"He's insane," said Cedric.

Cho was almost squealing with joy. "He's brilliant!" Then her face fell, as quickly as it had lit up. "He won't be on my team."

They watched as Harry made his way back to the stands in a roundabout fashion, dipping and diving, then accelerating into broad, sweeping turns that became barrel rolls.

When he alighted next to Cedric and Cho, his hair was in disarray, even more than usual. His hands were white-knuckled as he dismounted, but he was grinning hugely.

"That was bracing," said Harry. He ran a hand through his hair, which did nothing to help.

Cho practically wrenched the Cleansweep out of Harry's hands, barely waiting for Cedric's nod of assent before she took off, climbing into the sky and starting a series of exuberant aerial maneuvers that came quite close to anything Cedric could pull off on a good day. He sighed.

"First time on a broom, huh?" said Cedric.

Harry shrugged.

"Bollocks," said Cedric, and Harry blinked at Cedric's tone. "There's no way. Even if you were a complete natural, even if you learned how to do that as you were doing it, I don't buy it. Too many things you did right away are things you learn over time. Way you set your feet. Way you gripped the handle."

Harry tensed, and let out a long breath. "That was the first time I've been on a broom, Cedric." His voice got very quiet. "That I can remember."

Cedric crossed his arms. "What do you mean?"

"I… look, I can't talk about this now. Meet me tonight? Midnight, fourth floor, by the tapestry of Queen Mab?"

"After curfew?"

Harry grinned. It was a nervous grin, but it was still a grin. "You were complaining about not having any excitement in your life."

They watched as Cho finished off a loop, making her way towards them. She slowed as she descended towards the stands.

"All right," said Cedric, finally. Harry nodded in grateful acknowledgement.

Cho hopped off the broom and swept it over her shoulder in one graceful motion. She handed it back to Cedric.

"This is a great broom, Cedric," she said. "I've got a Comet Two-Sixty at home, and it's like a brick compared to this." She sighed. "I really, really wish first years could have brooms. It's just not fair."

"Hmm," said Harry, who rubbed his chin in an exaggerated 'thinking' gesture. "Is there a rule that says that Cedric can't have three brooms?"



* * *



Cedric felt like tiptoeing, but knew it would look ridiculous. It wasn't like running into Mrs. Norris was that likely, given the size of the castle, but if he was going to be caught, he was determined to do so in a dignified manner.

The abandoned wing of the fourth floor was even more unsettling at midnight. Every sound was magnified, including Cedric's breathing. The tapestry of Queen Mab looked harsh and beautiful in the stark light of Cedric's wand.

Harry was there, sitting on the floor, his back propped up against the wall opposite the tapestry. He was holding his wand in one hand, moving it slowly and precisely over a quill he held out in front of him. Cedric watched as the tip of the quill elongated, turning silver.

As Cedric approached, Harry looked up, and Cedric noticed a large bruise across his right cheek.

"You okay?" asked Cedric.

"Sure," said Harry, pocketing his wand and the half-transfigured quill. He rubbed at his face absently. "Did you know that the Queen Mab tapestry is actually a secret passage? You can only get into it if you're running fast enough, though."

"How on earth did you figure that out?"

Harry stood up, working out the kinks in his neck. "Trial and error," he said weakly. "A lot of error. She talks to you if you stand still in front of her long enough, gives you a riddle. I used a brute-force approach."

"I'll say," said Cedric. He stood there, watching Harry gather himself. "So… are you going to tell me what we're doing here?"

"Yes," said Harry.

Harry led the way down the hallway past the abandoned classrooms. With a practiced motion, he swung open the last door, which opened into nothing but the wall, and slammed it into place, completely open. Then he turned around, making his way to a doorway that Cedric was quite sure hadn't been there a moment ago.

They stood there for a full minute without saying anything. Cedric was still taking in the grandeur of the mirror when Harry spoke.

"Do you recognize it?"

"No," said Cedric, keeping his voice low, just above a whisper. Something about the mirror demanded it, like a courtroom, or a library. "There are a lot of famous magical mirrors. And a lot of them are really dangerous."

"This one's only dangerous if you let it be," said Harry, approaching it. "It was one of the many, many things I looked up after we talked about the library a few weeks ago." He stood at the mirror's side, running his hand along the burnished edge. "This is the Mirror of Erised. It's supposed to show you your deepest, most secret desire."

"It shows you what you want," said Cedric, stepping forward in spite of himself.

"Basically," shrugged Harry. "I get the sense that it's deeper than that, but I can't really tell, because it doesn't work for me."

Cedric turned him, surprised. "Really?"

"We'll get to that in a second. Go on, give it a try."

He should have thought about it, considered, been cautious. Instead, he stepped forward, directly in front of the Mirror.

Cedric stood there, entranced.

He wasn't sure what he'd been expecting, but it wasn't this. He was older, for one thing. In his late teens, by the look of it. Handsome, strong, confident. He was wearing an odd assortment of clothes; furs, leathers, gloves.

The scene flickered, as did the people surrounding him. An arctic wasteland, a dense jungle, a sun-scorched desert.

He was an explorer. A curse-breaker, maybe. He could see it in the eyes of the people near him – respect, admiration, even a little bit of awe. It was easy to get swept up in the vision. The Cedric in the mirror looked confident, at ease, in a way that was very familiar, yet achingly out of reach. It was a confidence borne of experience.

Was that all he really desired? To grow up? It seemed too simple, too common.

He felt a tapping on his shoulder, and, very reluctantly, turned away.

"It worked for you," Harry said. Not a question.

"Yes," murmured Cedric.

"When I look into the Mirror, all I see are dark shapes."

Cedric blinked. "Dark shapes?"

"Shadows. Vague impressions of people, objects. It's blurry."

They moved away from the Mirror, facing each other.

"It's like you don't know what you really want," said Cedric.

"I don't think that's it," said Harry. He brushed a hand through his hair, suddenly looking tired, almost exhausted. "I've given this a lot of thought. Even if I had no idea what I really wanted, the Mirror should know my heart's desire. That's what it's for. Were you surprised, when you saw? You don't have to tell me what it was."

Cedric glanced at the Mirror, then back, an involuntary reaction. "I was surprised."

"So you didn't know either. The Mirror showed you. That means with me, there's something… missing, maybe. Or blocked. The Sorting Hat said…" he looked down, as if afraid to meet Cedric's eyes. "It said my mind wasn't all there. That it couldn't see all my memories."

Cedric's mind was racing, trying to track the implications. "So… the broom thing…"

"I think you're right, I think I have ridden a broom before," said Harry. "I just don't remember it."

"What possible reason… I mean, how would you even…"

"There are spells," said Harry. His voice was flat. "Memory modification. I looked it up."

"Yeah, but they're… you can't change a person's life like that. I mean, Ministry Obliviators can make a Muggle forget they saw a wizard Disapparate or something, and the really good ones can tinker with a few days, maybe a week, change something big, but you're talking about something bigger."

"A lot bigger. Years."

"Do you know when… I mean, do you think everything – " He cut off, but the sentence hung in the air. Do you think everything you know is a lie?

Harry took a deep breath. Let it out, slowly. "I've been trying to narrow it down," he said at last. "I think whatever it is happened when I was around seven. I made breakfast for my aunt and uncle and cousin every day, since I could reach the stove…"

"What?"

"… and I can remember doing things wrong, getting yelled at in different ways. When I was younger, I mean. But around seven, it's all the same. Same breakfast, every morning. The same memory, I think. There are lots of little things like that. Tests, homework, even the weather."

He was talking faster, the words tumbling out. "And the more I think about it, the more little things I find that seem off. I mean I had no friends, absolutely none. There were times the summer before last when I probably didn't talk for a month. I remember being really shy, closed off. I am shy and closed off. Except when I forget to be. It's like I'm two people, or two versions of the same person and it's really scary." He stopped abruptly, gulping in air, looking at Cedric nervously.

"That's…" Cedric was momentarily lost for words. "That does sound scary. Not being able to trust yourself."

"You won't tell anyone, right?"

Cedric shook his head. "No way. This is… I mean, it's big, but it's your thing. I just want to help."

"Good." Harry breathed a gigantic sigh of relief. "Okay, that's good."

"We just need to think about this." Cedric walked to the side of the abandoned classroom and dragged over a pair of dusty chairs. "Let's just sit down and think this through."

"Okay," said Harry. They sat.

"Let's assume it's possible, what you're talking about. I mean, someone used magic and erased a bunch of your life and tried to make it seem like nothing happened. I mean, if you think it happened when you were around seven, then something strange happened then, and someone wants you to think that your life just kept going on like normal."

Harry ran his hand through his hair again. It seemed to be a wholly unconscious gesture. "Right. So do we try to figure out who did it, why they did it, or what happened to me in the first place?"

"I think the why is less important," said Cedric, leaning back in the chair, trying to relax even as his brain galloped forward. "Obviously it's very important, but it kind of answers itself if we get the other two."

"And the why is pretty easy," said Harry grimly. "Either someone's trying to help me, or someone's trying to hurt me."

"Maybe," said Cedric. "It might not be that simple. It might be to help someone else, like if you saw something you shouldn't."

"Something that lasted four years?"

"Okay, that's true. Maybe…"

"I keep coming back to the broom thing," said Harry. "Something long-term happened, and I learned how to ride a broom. It can't have been something bad then, right?"

"I… don't think you can be sure," said Cedric. "Four years is a long time."

"So we don't know anything."

"We know some things. It might help to write it all down."

"No." Harry shook his head. "I don't want to risk it, leaving something like that around. Someone could see it. Can't trust anyone."

Cedric hesitated. "Cho?"

"I don't know. Yeah. Probably. I've only known her a couple weeks."

"I don't mean to make you more paranoid or anything, but you've only known me for a couple weeks."

"I have to trust someone," said Harry. He looked terribly small just then, hunched over in the chair, head in his hands. "I think I'd go stark raving mad if I didn't. I honestly do."

Cedric didn't quite know what to say to that. The idea of not trusting someone was kind of a fuzzy one, something that happened in stories, or far in the future. Harry Potter, he supposed, had a way of making you think about all kinds of hypothetical things in a more personal way.

Harry stood up. "I think we should go. Can't risk being out too long. That stupid cat nearly got me night before last."

Following his lead, Cedric got to his feet. "Can't say I'm totally okay with breaking the rules like this."

"It's fine," said Harry, waving his hand like he was brushing away a fly. "If they really cared all that much, they'd make it a lot harder to wander around at night."

They opened the door to the hallway, slowly peeking their heads out to make sure the coast was clear.

"I'll tell Cho this weekend," said Harry. "Maybe bring her here, do it the same way."

"That's good," said Cedric absently, already mentally mapping out the best way back to the Hufflepuff dormitory. "Maybe you should start really focusing on times when you feel like you're different, or remembering something, or whatever you call it. Keep a list in your head."

"Yeah," said Harry, slipping out of the room and into the hallway. "Good idea. Listen, Cedric…" He turned, not quite looking Cedric in the eyes. "Just… thanks."

There was a lot of meaning packed into that word.

"Sure, Harry," said Cedric. He tried to put the same amount of feeling behind his two words and wasn't sure he'd done it right.

They parted ways, and Cedric took his time getting back.



* * *



"Heads up!"

Harry's voice caught him off-guard, and Cedric barely had time to react. He threw himself down and to the right, almost slipping off his broom, and caught the bean bag a few feet off the snow-covered ground.

He leveled off, felt the bag grow hot even through his gloves, and threw it up in the air blindly.

He heard Cho's startled yelp and turned just in time to see the bag glance off her outstretched fingers.

Harry adjusted his dive, swooping in to grab it. He was clutching a second and third bean bag in his left hand, and he flicked one at Cedric as he dove. He caught and threw in the same motion, passing it back to Cho.

"Yes!" Harry threw up his arm triumphantly, and then noticed the remaining bag in his hand. "Crap."

It exploded in a poof into a purple, foul-smelling cloud.

After Cho had finished laughing, she joined Cedric as he hovered near the ground. They were near the Black Lake, snow all around them, the tall, imposing fixture of Hogwarts in the background. They weren't the only ones enjoying the last weekend before the Christmas holiday. A group of fifth-year Hufflepuffs were taking a break from revision to start a snowball fight near the gamekeeper's hut. Fred and George Weasley were nearby, in the middle of building a fifteen-foot tall, monstrous looking snowman that would undoubtedly be Charmed to do something unspeakably rude and humorous.

Katie Bell was sitting near the greenhouses, chatting with two second-year Gryffindor girls whose names escaped Cedric. Cedric had originally thought Katie might have gravitated towards himself, Harry and Cho, as she was the only other first-year Gryffindor Harry could stand, but instead, she'd bonded with the two girls she was sitting with now, both Chasers on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, if Cedric remembered right.

Harry floated down to ground level, joining them, but keeping himself far enough away that the stench of Dungbombs was muted.

"We need to get another set of these," said Harry, holding up the bean bag. "There was no way that was five seconds. It's losing its magic or something."

"Don't be a sore loser," said Cho, hovering sideways to nudge his shoulder. She crinkled her nose. "You smell terrible."

Harry glared at her.

"So, you're both staying for the Christmas hols?" asked Cedric, brushing a dusting of snow off his broom handle. His finger traced the dark blue lettering that read Cleansweep Seven. Harry and Cho's brooms bore similar markings.

Cho bobbed her head. "My mum's dragging my dad to a Transfiguration conference in Prague. They said I could come, but, you know…" she trailed off. "Not that I don't want to see them. But this will be nice, I think, being here. It's really beautiful when it's snowing."

"I'm staying," said Harry. "I'd stay even if we had to go to Potions every day. It would still beat my aunt and uncle's house."

Cedric cast a sidelong glance at Harry. "I still don't get why you hate Potions. It's a really interesting subject."

"Snape is such a… such a twat," said Harry.

Cho sputtered at the coarse language, almost falling off her broom as she tried – ineffectually – to smack Harry, who dodged easily.

"Honestly, Harry, he's not that bad," said Cedric.

"You only think that because you've never had a Potions class with the Slytherins," muttered Harry darkly. "And he's got it out for me. Last week he took points off because I didn't know the capital of Greece."

"He didn't really ask you that," said Cho uncertainly.

"Did too. I said Athens, and then he just smirks and says in his slimy, arrogant voice, 'The magical capital, Potter.' Like I was supposed to know that!"

"Well, to be fair, the ICW has its headquarters in Patras, so most wizards would assume that's what you were – " Cedric held up his hands as Harry glared at him. "Right. Not helping."

"You know who's worse than Snape?" asked Cho. "Professor Doge. He's creepy. I don't think I've ever seen him blink. And those two Aurors that follow him everywhere don't even pretend that they're not watching him. Why would we have a Defense professor who needed to be guarded by Aurors?"

"I don't know, Hogwarts runs through Defense professors pretty fast," said Cedric. "At this point, we're probably down to 'qualified, respectable, and willing to teach – pick two'."

"He knows what he's talking about, at least," said Harry. "But he's got a pretty bad reputation. I asked around. That vigilante group, the Order of the Phoenix – he was part of it. A few months after, you know –" he gestured at his scar "– he almost went to Azkaban for something. And then about a year ago, he got caught breaking into the Ministry. I think he's teaching because of that, actually. You know, like, community service."

Cho and Cedric looked at each other blankly.

"Never mind," said Harry. "Anyway, there's something off about him, definitely, but at least he's not a complete git."

"You think Doge might have something to do with your... thing?" asked Cedric. He lowered his voice at the end.

"Dunno," shrugged Harry. "Can't go around accusing everyone who appears kind of evil of Memory Charming me, or I'd have started with Snape and Filch."

Cedric sighed. It had been months, and although Harry's jarring personality shifts had faded, they weren't any closer to solving the mystery of his missing years. Even with Cho's input, they'd been unable to think of any good avenues to explore. They'd been hampered by Harry's insistence that they keep their project a secret, and blatantly asking teachers about memory modification or checking books out of the library on Obliviators wasn't exactly keeping a low profile.

"What are they doing, do you think?" asked Cho. Cedric craned his neck to follow her glance, and saw a group of older students clustered together near the main gates. They weren't doing anything outlandish – a dozen or so sixth and seventh years standing in a loose circle – but what was notable about them was the fact that the group was made up of students from all four Houses.

"That's odd," said Harry, apparently picking up on it as well.

"Huh," said Cedric. He looked back toward the gamekeeper's hut, at Fred and George. "You know, something like this happened last year around the same time. The weeks leading up to Christmas, you'd see groups of older students from different Houses getting together like this. The Weasley twins were bragging that they knew what it was about, said one of their older brothers told them about it."

"Want to go ask them about it?" said Harry. "Maybe give them a hand with that snowman; it looks interesting. Are those tentacles?"

"Actually," said Cho, "I was hoping we could do something else." She gestured and Cedric and Harry glanced at each other, then followed as she rose into the air. She ended up several hundred feet off the ground, hovering just at the edge of the Black Lake.

Without speaking, they arranged themselves in a triangle, facing inward. Cho smiled slightly as Cedric and Harry looked to her, waiting for her signal. She wasn't shy about letting them know how much she enjoyed taking the lead.

One hand steadying herself on her broom, Cho reached into her thick winter coat and pulled out her wand, holding it up. Harry and Cedric copied her, watching closely for her first move.

Even before she started to cast, Cedric was speaking. They'd practiced, and for the timing to work out just right, he needed to jump the gun a bit.

"Cephusortia," said Cedric firmly, focusing on the centerpoint between them and moving his wand in a quick wavy gesture.

"Wingardium Leviosa." Harry's timing was nearly perfect, and Cedric's conjured shallow, stone bowl barely dipped.

"Caerulignis." Cho rushed it a little, trying to time it right on top of Harry's spell, and the bluebell flames spilled over the bowl for a moment, flickering to the ground like dying blue cinders.

The end result, when all was said and done, looked rather impressive. Cedric, Cho and Harry inched forward, warmed by the fire, hovering high in the air, surrounding a wide, stone bowl with a roaring magical blue fire contained in it. Cedric noticed the snowball fight on the grounds flag for a moment as more than a few students looked up at them.

"God, magic is so cool," mumbled Harry as he tugged off his gloves, holding one hand at a time out over the fire.

They hung in the air for a minute, enjoying the warmth.

"So, I wanted to make this a special occasion," said Cho. "I know it's not really Christmas yet, and we're all staying here anyway, but I wanted to say…" she sped up, her voice getting a little higher. "I know you're boys so you're not allowed to say it out loud, but you're both my really good friends and you mean a lot to me and I thought maybe we could tell each other something about our lives that we've never told anyone else, or something about our feelings, and Harry if you laugh at me I swear I'll hex you right off that broom."

Harry wiped the grin off his face, looking at her soberly. "No laughing. I don't know about sharing feelings, though. You know boys only have like three of them, right?"

"In the spirit of not being a stereotype, I'm going to have to disagree with you," said Cedric.

"I was only kidding," muttered Harry.

"Maybe not feelings," said Cho. "But we've talked about a lot of stuff, and I've noticed we never talk about our lives away from Hogwarts. And I think there's a good reason – none of them are that great. At least, that's what I've picked up on from you two. And I thought since it's kind of uncomfortable, we'd never talk about it if we didn't bring it up all awkwardly like this, but maybe if we did, it would be nice."

"Tell me honestly," said Harry, turning to Cedric. "Have the three of us just been spending too much time together, or did that kind of make sense?"

"Prat," said Cho, not unkindly.

"There's not much to tell," said Cedric. He kept his tone clipped and even. "My parents are fine. I mean, they've never done anything wrong or yelled at me or anything, and they're really proud of me when I get good grades and stuff. They're just a little… cold, I guess. We'd never have this kind of conversation. They care a lot about what things look like, and less about what's actually going on under the surface."

Cho was looking at him, her gaze a bit too understanding.

"They're really not bad," said Cedric, feeling a need to defend them, and recognizing at the same time that it came from an ingrained need to project the right image. He scowled. "But if you ever come visit, Harry, they'll be a lot more happy that you're the Boy Who Lived than they will at me making a friend."

"Gotcha," said Harry, sighing.

Cho brushed snow off her jacket, looking intently into the bluebell flames. "I guess my parents are a little like Cedric's," she said after a few moments. "They don't care as much about appearances, but they don't talk about feelings much either. They run a business making high-end telescopes for Astronomy, and they're really focused on that. They assume I'm going to be a part of it, and they hate that I like Quidditch so much."

"That's… not fun," said Cedric. He tried to imagine what it would be like to have his parents fight him on something like that. On the one hand, it would be nice to know that they cared. On the other… well, he did enjoy the latitude that came with parents like his.

They both turned to Harry expectantly.

"My turn, huh?" he said. He followed Cho's example and looked into the fire. The flames, thought Cedric, were even more mesmerizing than real fire. The blue seemed to deepen in the center of the bowl, and the way they sprung into being continuously was almost hypnotic.

"Besides the obvious bit where I can't really tell what my life at home was like past the age of seven, growing up with the Dursleys was pretty much what you'd expect," said Harry. "My first memory of dear old Aunt Petunia is of her slapping my hand away as I tried to hug her, and her saying 'I'm not your mother.' I'll just let you extrapolate the rest of my childhood from there."

Cedric was torn between asking Harry where he'd heard the word 'extrapolate' and flying over and giving him a manly, but supportive clap on the shoulder.

Cho apparently felt no such uncertainty. She dipped her broom and nudged over to Harry, and then tentatively – because of the fact that it was hard to balance with one hand on a broom, or because she was nervous? – put her arm around his shoulders. She didn't say anything.

"Thanks," said Harry after a while. Cho moved away, going back to her place in the triangle. "I'm kind of over it, though. After a while it just becomes normal. And I don't think I'm too messed up because of it. That's why I like to think whatever happened to me was a good thing, even if I can't remember. I mean, it had to be better than that."

Cho looked away.

Cedric cleared his throat. "Um. You guys want to go ask Fred and George about those upper years?"

Harry drew his wand quickly, apparently eager for the change of subject. "Yeah, definitely." He pointed his wand at the stone bowl. "Finite Incantatem."

The bowl and the flames popped out of existence.

"Show-off," said Cho, grinning at him.

"If you have friends in second year and you're not learning all the spells they know, you're not trying hard enough," said Harry with a solemn expression that quickly turned into a smirk directed Cho's way.

At more or less the same time, they wheeled in the direction of Fred and George's monster snowman and started flying.

Cedric drifted to Harry's side. "How did you cancel the bowl and the flames at the same time?" He had to raise his voice over the rushing wind.

Harry frowned. "Not sure."

"Something to add to the list?"

"Damn. Yeah." Harry was barely concentrating on flying, his expression looking almost comically thoughtful. "I think it helps if you think of them as one thing. The bowl and the flame, I mean."

Cedric would have continued the discussion, but it was a short flight to the gamekeeper's hut.

Harry and Cedric landed, brushing against the snow, coming to a stop and then dismounting. Cho, on the other hand, elected to go with her signature move, not even stopping as her feet hit the ground, pulling her broom through her legs and sweeping it onto her shoulders in one movement.

"Now who's the show-off?" said Harry.

"Aw, it's okay, Harry," said Cho. "You could learn how to do it if you really tried. Probably. Maybe."

"I know I could learn it, but I could spend the ten hours it would take learning something useful instead."

"It's very useful."

"How, exactly?"

"Because sometimes it's useful to look awesome."

Harry stared at her for a moment before throwing up his hands in exasperation and walking towards Fred and George.

"So how long did it actually take you to learn?" asked Cedric.

"Maybe an hour a day, all of last summer," said Cho. "And I fell down a lot."

"Right. Gonna have to go with Harry on this one."

Harry was already deep in conversation with Fred and George as Cedric approached.

"… couldn't say one way or the other," said one of the twins. "We're not the type to just go around blabbing other people's secrets."

"Not unless it would be really, really funny," said the other.

"How about a trade, then?" said Harry. "I happen to know for a fact that you've been trying to unlock the secret passage on the second floor near the statue of Barnabas the Bloated."

"We know you know," said a twin. Cedric decided, arbitrarily, that it was Fred. "You weren't very sneaky when you were watching us."

Harry's eyebrows climbed his forehead. "I was extremely sneaky. There was no way you spotted me."

"We have our ways," said George, with a passable attempt at a mysterious smile.

"Regardless," said Harry, shaking it off. "Do we have a deal? I tell you how to unlock the statue, you tell us what's going on with the upper years."

The twins looked at each other, one of those silent moments of communication. "Deal," said Fred.

"You first," said Harry. "We both know the secret passage is worth more. Whatever the upper years are doing can't be that interesting or they wouldn't be doing it out in the open."

"It's kind of an open secret, actually," said George. "The staff knows all about it. There's a Christmas party every year for every student above third year. Last year's House Cup winners get to pick location and details, and the losers have to pay for it."

"That's it?" said Cho, looking unimpressed. "Just a party?"

"Just a party?" said Fred, aghast.

"From what we hear, it's a bit more than that," said George. "It lasts the whole night, right before everyone goes home for Christmas, and it's basically the one time the Houses aren't at each other's throats. You do the math. People get crazy. Our older brother Charlie told us everyone calls the train home the next day the Hangover Express."

"I'm surprised the professors let them get away with that," said Cedric.

"It's kind of an unspoken understanding, from what we hear," said George. "The staff turns a blind eye, and in return the upper forms make sure everyone cares about House points."

"I knew there had to be a reason everyone was so uptight about points," said Harry.

"Well, we still don't care about them," said Fred loftily. "One has to maintain one's priorities."

"Now the secret passage, if you please," said George.

"Fine," said Harry, rolling his eyes. He stepped forward and cupped his hand around his mouth, leaning close to Fred.

"Really?" said Fred as Harry pulled away. "With your leg?"

"I swear," said Harry.

"If you're having us on…" said George.

"Don't worry, I'm not pulling your leg," said Harry.

Fred groaned. "We really should have had that one."

Cedric stepped forward, breaking into the conversation. It was better to not let Fred and George get on a roll. "Hate to break this up, but we're about to have company." He pointed to the left, where a group of boys were trudging through the snow towards them.

"That's Zacharias Smith," said Cho, narrowing her eyes. "What does he want?"

"Who knows?" said Harry, glancing over at the oncoming group, then away, dismissing them. "Whatever it is, it's bound to be annoying. I say we fly off."

"Hey, you can't just leave us here," said George. "Our snow-monster isn't even done yet. And we haven't charmed the tentacles to snake out and drag people into the mouth."

"Hilarious," said Cho.

"Let's see what he's got to say," said Cedric. "They're all people from Hufflepuff. It wouldn't look great if I just flew away."

Harry half-turned, giving him a look, and Cedric was reminded of what he'd told Harry and Cho a few minutes ago about maintaining an image. He squared his shoulders, facing the approaching group.

There were six of them, all Hufflepuffs, all boys, no one older than third year. Cedric knew all of them.

"What's that supposed to be?" said Zacharias, pointing at Fred and George's creation.

"Why don't you step about ten feet closer and find out?" said George. He waved his wand and one of the snow-tentacles twitched ominously.

Zacharias crossed his arms. "We're not here for you two. We just want to talk to this lot." He pointed at Harry, Cedric and Cho.

"Make it quick, Smith," said Harry, flicking a bit of snow off his fingernails. "Going by our previous conversations, I don't exactly have high hopes that you're going to say anything worthwhile."

"What an arrogant git," he muttered. He turned to the group of Hufflepuffs. "See what I mean?" He turned back to Harry. "What gives you the power to know what I say isn't important?"

"Experience?" said Harry, shrugging impatiently.

"Did you guys come down just to trade insults?" said Cedric. "I really don't like how that looks for us."

"That's rich," said Zacharias. "You said us. When you spent more time with those two than you do with your own House."

"It's called having friends, Smith," snapped Harry. "Maybe you should try it."

Cho put an arm out and tugged on Harry's sleeve, trying to get his attention and shaking her head.

Zacharias pointed at them dramatically. "Fine! You want me to get to the point? It's those!" He swept his finger over the three of them, pointing at their brooms. "You and Chang can't have brooms. You're first-years. Just because you're Harry Potter, you think you can get away with special treatment."

"They're Cedric's brooms," said Harry mildly. "Cho and I are just borrowing them."

"Bollocks, Potter!" said Zacharias, almost shouting now. "No one bought that stupid excuse when you got them months ago, and no one's buying it now. You're just using a stupid loophole."

"Maybe instead of complaining about it, you should use that stupid loophole too."

Zacharias was glowering. "That's not… you don't… you can't…"

Cedric realized he'd lost track of Fred and George during the confrontation, and had just a few seconds to feel an impending sense of doom before the snow-tentacle whipped over his head, winding around Zacharias's waist and dragging him, screaming, into the gaping, fanged mouth of the snow-beast.

Fred and George were standing next to it, their wands out, muttering incantations around their huge grins.

Zacharias's screams were muffled as the mouth closed, and the snowman made a distinct burping noise. Fred and George backed up, wearing identical looks of anticipation. Cedric could see the middle section of the snow-monster moving, shaking, snow falling off in clumps.

Then Zacharias was expelled, forcibly, from the snow-monster's lower section, on the opposite side as the mouth. The noise was loud, and like a burp but much more juvenile.

Fred and George high-fived each other, then collapsed with laughter. That pretty much set the match to the kindling, and by the time Cedric started chuckling, everyone else was too, including the Hufflepuffs.

Cedric barely registered it as Zacharias picked himself up, shaking with anger, and pointed his wand at them. "You… you…" his voice was hoarse and very, very ugly.

Cedric rolled to his feet, adrenaline shooting through him. Zacharias wasn't aiming at Fred and George. He was aiming at Harry, Cedric and Cho.

"Watch out!" It was an exclamation from someone behind him. One of the Hufflepuffs. Cedric barely heard it. He was reaching for his wand.

Too slow. Zacharias was bringing his arm down, twisting his wand. He was pointing at Cho.

"Anteocul –" Zacharias's incantation was interrupted by a flash of light that sent him stumbling back, wide-eyed and reeling, as the spell died on the tip of his wand.

Cho, who had started to dive out of the way, looked up at Harry. Cedric followed her eyes and saw Harry, standing with his wand out, his arm just completing a slashing, twisting motion.

No one said anything. Harry Potter lowered his wand, his eyes wide.

Cedric exchanged a wary look with Cho. The same thought was obviously running through her mind. He just blocked a spell. That's… he shouldn't know how to do that. I don't know how to do that. Cedric's mind was trying to process the implications. Maybe we can ask everyone not to say anything. Except, damn, Smith… can't ask him, he'll tell for sure that way. Blackmail? Anything I can use? If he'd had time to think about it, Cedric would have been a little shocked how fast he'd considered that.

"Harry Potter."

And just like that, it didn't matter anymore. The voice was an adult one.

Cedric looked over his shoulder. It was one of the Aurors who shadowed Professor Doge, the female of the pair. She was shimmering into view, her form turning gradually from a chameleon-like transparency back to normal.

She was pointing at Harry, gesturing. "Come with me. We're going to the Headmaster's office. Right now."

Harry pulled himself to his feet – he'd freed his wand from his robes from a sitting position in about a second, Cedric noted absently – and looked at his friends.

"Not them, just you." The Auror's voice was implacable.

Harry turned to them. "You know what to do." He caught Cedric and Cho with a meaningful gaze.

"Right now means right now," said the Auror, and took a step forward.

"All right, all right," said Harry. He started walking towards the castle, and the Auror put a hand on his shoulder, walking behind him. It wasn't a friendly gesture, like a friend would do. It looked more like someone leading a prisoner.

Cedric reached out and took Cho's hand as they watched Harry walk towards the castle, the Auror at his side, both shapes gradually getting smaller as they faded into the snow.

Good reviews keep me motivated, reviews with solid and/or insightful feedback keep the story good, and all reviews are very much appreciated.





4. Chapter 4

Author's note: A big thanks to my betas, Shaydrall and Alyksandr, for their work on this as well as their help tightening up previous chapters.

The end of this chapter and the beginning of this one have been revised - Harry no longer uses a nonverbal Shield Charm against Smith. (He's advanced, but he's not that advanced.) There are a few other changes/fixes.

Chapter 3 – The Wardrobe

Harry's mind was racing as the Auror led him through the Entrance Hall. She'd paused very briefly during the walk to shoot an ethereal, silvery hawk in the castle's direction, but aside from that, she seemed determined to convey Harry to the Headmaster's office without stopping, and without talking.

"Look, can you tell me what this is about?"

"What's your name?"

"Would you mind stopping for a second so I can tie my shoe?"

All were met with silence.

Harry started to panic a little as they crossed the threshold into the Great Hall. He stopped walking, and the Auror glowered at him, starting to raise her wand.

"Just listen to me," said Harry, holding up his hands. "You went to Hogwarts, right?" It was a guess, but an educated one. "You know what this place is like. You walk me through the Great Hall like I'm under arrest and by the time we're done with whatever this is, the story will be that I dropped Zacharias Smith from my broom and impaled him on the school gates."

The Auror raised her eyebrow. She looked at him, her stare penetrating. Harry crossed his fingers.

"You walk ahead of me," she said at last. "I'll meet you in the hallway. You do anything I don't like, start running, start shouting, anything, and I'll put you in a Full Body-Bind in front of all your friends."

Harry let out a breath. "Thanks."

She pursed her lips. "Elaine Savage. Gryffindor, class of eighty-two." Harry nodded, turned to go. "I was watching you fly, before." She pointed a finger at him, almost accusingly. "You try out for Quidditch next year, got it?"

"Got it," said Harry, nodding weakly.

"Good," she said. "Now go."

Harry walked into the Great Hall, trying to act naturally. He responded to a few older Gryffindors who threw greetings his way, and he walked slowly, keeping an easy smile on his face. Internally, he was the opposite of calm. She was just there. Was she watching me? Seems like it. How long? Just today? The whole year? No, I've seen her and the other one guarding Doge together. Only sometimes? Why now?

He waited for Savage just outside the Hall. She caught up with him, then jerked her head in the direction of the Headmaster's office.

"You're one of those long-winded types, aren't you?" murmured Harry. She didn't even twitch.

Harry didn't seriously consider running, but the thought did cross his mind for a fleeting moment. He couldn't imagine he was going to get a detention – if anything, he'd expect to get points for stopping Smith from cursing Cho – rather, he suspected he was in extra-scholastic trouble, something that went beyond Hogwarts. If the Ministry was responsible for Harry's memory problems, they'd undoubtedly be concerned that he'd blocked a spell as competently as he had. He'd only read about blocking spells a few weeks ago.

The male Auror was waiting for them at the base of the stairway to the Headmaster's office. He was no more expressive than Savage, but he was leaning against the wall with his eyes closed and his arms crossed.

He opened his eyes as Harry approached.

"Savage," said the male Auror.

"Proudfoot," replied Savage evenly.

Harry felt an impulse to bellow "Proudfeet!" but thankfully squashed it. He'd gotten better at identifying, controlling, and integrating moments when his "other self," as Cedric called it, asserted itself. Given the situation, Harry didn't want to have to explain yet another thing he'd done that he didn't understand himself.

Savage walked to the stone gargoyle and tapped it with her wand. "Auror Savage, override."

The gargoyle sprung to the side adroitly, revealing a winding stone staircase. Harry walked forward, though he didn't have much of a choice with Savage leading the way and Proudfoot behind him. As they crowded into the stairwell, Savage murmured something inaudible and tapped the wall. The staircase started rotating with a soft grinding sound, stone on stone.

Harry's view of the Headmaster's office was obscured by Savage's robes, but when she stepped aside, Harry almost stumbled as he looked around.

The room was large, circular, and strange. Harry's eyes traveled over the walls. There were dozens of portraits, men and women of age and dignified stature. Most were asleep. Harry noticed that one was covered by a heavy black velvet drape. The centerpiece of the room was an enormous, claw-footed desk, the style and construction of which reminded Harry vaguely of the Mirror of Erised. Both, perhaps, were part of the castle's history. He looked around. Shelves, tables, and four separate bookcases. One table had what looked at first glance like a terrarium, but when Harry looked closer, it was actually the mouth of a river in miniature – sand, trees, rocks, green grass waving gently in a non-existent breeze, all replicated in intricate detail. The river spilled over the edge of the table, the flowing water vanishing in midair about halfway to the floor.

Harry could have spent the rest of the day just looking around the room if he hadn't been about to have a panic attack.

His eyes focused on the desk, and the man sitting behind it.

Aberforth Dumbledore was still, but not calm. Though he was dressed in formal robes, everything about him, from the somewhat ragged way his beard framed his face to the way the sleeves of his robes were sun-bleached and worn, screamed "rough around the edges." He narrowed his eyes, looking over his spectacles at the intruders into his domain.

"Auror Savage, Auror Proudfoot, and Harry Potter walk into my office. Could be it's the start of a joke, but somehow I don't think I'm going to be laughing." Aberforth steepled his fingers and leaned back in his massive chair.

"Headmaster," said Savage, tilting her head fractionally. "My apologies. We require the temporary use of your office. May we use your Floo?"

Aberforth smiled, but it was a bitter one. "I suppose it's decent of you to pretend I have a say in the matter."

Proudfoot walked to the ornate fireplace, tossed in a pinch of silvery powder, and green flame sprung up. "Ministry of Magic, Auror Office." He stepped through without a backward glance.

In the ensuing silence, Harry learned two things about himself. First, that he really didn't like standing still. And second, that he was a born contrarian. It was so blindingly obvious that he was supposed to crack, to break down and demand to know what was going on, to panic and say something that would get him in trouble – but that would be the obvious thing to do, and so Harry focused, very hard, on looking placid. It wasn't easy to look like you hadn't a care in the world when you were, in fact, sweating through your winter cloak, but it gave him something to do.

Surprisingly, it was the Headmaster who broke the long moment of stillness. He stood up. Walked to the window. Clasped his hands behind his back. Harry could see his reflection in the windowpane. He looked a little wistful.

"You know, there used to be days when I actually enjoyed this job," said Aberforth. When he turned around, he was all business. "Now, one of you needs to tell me what the bloody hell is going on. I don't have the patience for regulations and proper channels."

Savage glanced at the Floo and looked thoughtful for a moment. "As you know, Headmaster, we were assigned to Hogwarts to keep an eye on Elphias Doge. He's a known criminal, after all, and it would be completely irresponsible to let him teach a class full of children without supervision." She glanced at Harry for a moment. "What you weren't told was that we had a…secondary objective."

"Of course you did," muttered the Headmaster. "And we won't even get in to your third objective of making sure to subtly remind everyone that the Ministry walks tall and carries a big stick."

"The Minister was concerned that Mr. Potter might have been in contact with, or unknowingly influenced by… undesirable elements," she continued smoothly, apparently ignoring Aberforth's comments. "We were instructed to observe Mr. Potter for signs of anything unusual."

"And?" asked Aberforth gruffly.

"Let's wait for the others," said Savage. "I prefer not to repeat myself."

Aberforth blew out a breath, his beard fluttering. "Bureaucrats." It wasn't a complimentary statement. He turned to Harry. "And what about you, boy? Anything to say for yourself?"

Harry found himself bristling a little at the "boy" comment. He smoothed his features into an expression of mild curiosity as he looked up at the Headmaster. "I honestly have no idea why I'm here, sir. Unless you're going to personally award me points for stopping a fellow student from getting hit with an antler-growing hex?"

Aberforth pursed his lips, then turned to Savage.

She shrugged. "Like I said, I'd rather only explain it once."

At that moment, the fireplace belched green flame, and four men stepped out, one after another.

The first one through was Auror Proudfoot, and the three that followed, aside from the fact that they all wore formal robes, couldn't have been more different. The first was a broad-shouldered, powerfully built man with a tawny mane of hair like a lion's. The second man was tall and thin and dressed impeccably, but had an air of gauntness, of brittleness. Bringing up the rear was a short, portly man in a pinstriped cloak. He clutched a lime-green bowler hat against his chest, and he had a gold pocket watch chain dangling from his waistcoat. He looked like someone dressed as a dandy, who only knew what a dandy was via rough description.

The last one through zeroed in on Harry right away, breaking into a jovial smile. "Harry Potter, in the flesh! Excellent to meet you." He walked over to Harry, moving in for a vigorous handshake. "I know, I know, not the best circumstances for a meeting, but it couldn't be helped! I'm Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic."

"Hello," said Harry, a bit taken aback by the flurry of activity. Even as Fudge had introduced himself, the lion-haired man had cornered Savage, interrogating her in a low voice. The third man simply stood close to the fireplace, not looking at anyone in particular.

"I'm sure you're wondering what all this is about," said Fudge, still with that big smile plastered on his face. "Not to worry, not to worry. We'll have this all cleared up in a jiffy."

He seemed to notice Harry's eyes traveling around the room. "Of course!" said Fudge. "How inconsiderate of me. Introductions all around!" He drew Harry forward, where the Ministry men were congregating into a loose semicircle. "You've already met Aurors Savage and Proudfoot, of course, and this fine fellow is their boss, Rufus Scrimgeour, Head of the Auror Office."

None of the three individuals spared Harry so much as a glance. Either Fudge wasn't aware of the tension in the room, or he was doing a very good job of pretending it didn't exist.

"And this gentleman is Bartemius Crouch, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot." Fudge gestured with his bowler cap in the direction of the tall, thin man standing off by himself. "He's here in case we encounter any, er… legal difficulties."

Harry was still trying to get his bearings, but given the titles of the three new individuals, he was pretty sure his best course of action was to say and do absolutely nothing until he was asked a direct question. He simply nodded as the Minister led him around the room.

Scrimgeour broke away from the two Aurors and strode over to Harry, standing in front of him. "Your wand, Mr. Potter."

Harry looked around, trying to get a read on the room, and didn't like what he saw. He didn't have any allies here. The only possible wedge he'd seen was the animosity between the Headmaster and the Aurors. He doesn't like the Ministry interfering with Hogwarts, thought Harry, shrugging mentally. Well, it's worth a shot.

He turned to Aberforth. "Headmaster? I haven't had a chance to read up on the finer points of wizarding law. Am I required to give up my wand?"

The Headmaster frowned at Harry. "The Ministry has a broad range of powers when it comes to educational oversight." An ambivalent answer if Harry had ever heard one, and Aberforth's expression seemed to say you're on your own, kid.

"Now, really!" said Fudge. "This is just an informal, friendly meeting. No need to start off on the wrong foot." He glanced at Harry somewhat apprehensively.

Harry took a deep breath. Pick your battles. He reached into his robes, and didn't miss the way the Aurors subtly tensed. He drew out his wand, slowly, and held it out.

Scrimgeour plucked it from his hand and held it up, drawing his own wand. He held the tip against Harry's wand. "Prior Incantato!" he said firmly.

A ghostly image erupted from the point where the wands met. It was blurry, indistinct. Scrimgeour and the Aurors leaned in, studying it closely as a vague cloud of smoke seemed to solidify into a shape, only to be dashed into dust motes, like someone blowing on a column of smoke.

"Not a very impressive block," said Scrimgeour. He turned to Savage. "You say it stopped a low-level hex?"

"Anteoculatia, to be precise. The antler-growing hex," said Savage. "The reason I called it in is the way he cast it." She nodded meaningfully at Harry. "He reacted on reflex. Implying practice. Implying a lot of practice."

"You're positive?" said Scrimgeour. "That's a fairly subjective and subtle detail to notice."

Savage looked a bit put out. "I'm trained to notice exactly those kinds of details, sir. As you well know."

Scrimgeour grunted. "I suppose so." He waved his wand. "Deletrius." The ghostly image wavered, and dissolved into nothing. The Head Auror fixed Harry with a level, steady look. "Explain yourself, Mr. Potter."

"I just reacted. Stuff like that just happens around me," said Harry. He tried to keep his voice steady and calm. "Since I can remember, really. I'll get really stressed and then something odd happens, like my hair growing back after a bad haircut, or getting onto a roof to escape a bunch of bullies and having no idea how I got there."

The Aurors exchanged a long glance with their boss.

"Accidental magic," said Scrimgeour. He seemed to be weighing the phrase. "I suppose it's possible. But a blocking a spell is a deliberate bit of magic. Not something a scared child is likely to produce on a whim."

"I've read about blocking spells," said Harry irritably, trying not to let the 'child' bit get to him. "It's not complicated, at least for anything Smith is likely to know. It just takes good reflexes, good timing, and practice." He jerked his head towards Savage. "She was watching me fly, before, so she can tell you about that."

"Mr. Potter is quite advanced for his age," said Aberforth, breaking in quietly. He stood a bit off to the side, leaning against his desk. "Flitwick, in particular, is quite pleased with the boy's progress in Charms."

Scrimgeour turned to the Headmaster, arching an eyebrow. "And the fact that blocking spells isn't even mentioned in the first year Defense curriculum?"

"It's not a crime to read ahead," said Aberforth, shrugging. "The boy's mother was a bloody prodigy, and I personally saw James Potter do things with a wand that would take the combined efforts of a lunatic asylum to think up. It's not a stretch to imagine the lad's inherited some of that."

"Should I take it as suspicious, Aberforth," said Scrimgeour, "that you of all people are coming to Mr. Potter's defense?"

Harry noted, as the confrontation played out in front of him, that Scrimgeour, not Fudge, was clearly dominating the meeting. In fact, Fudge was looking between Harry, Aberforth, and Scrimgeour, his brow furrowed, shaking his head a little.

The Headmaster scowled and crossed his arms. "Take it however you want, Rufus. It's my job to look out for all my students."

"So," said Scrimgeour, turning back to Harry, who couldn't help but shrink a little at the intense scrutiny. "A talented student goes a step further, brought on by the focus and stress of defending a comrade." He paused deliberately. "No, I don't think so. It's possible. But I have doubts." He jerked his head towards Proudfoot. "Proceed."

Fudge took a step forward. "Now really, Rufus, is this necessary?"

"Need I remind you, Minister, just whom we suspect of interfering with Mr. Potter?" Scrimgeour flicked his wand at the wall, and the black velvet covering one of the portraits dropped to the floor. The man in the portrait was sleeping, and looked quite a bit like the Headmaster, except his beard was whiter, his entire countenance more dignified. He was gently snoring, half-moon spectacles threatening to slip off his face, which made the fact that Fudge turned ashen and backed up a step fairly puzzling to Harry.

"I've never seen that man before in my life," said Harry. "Who is he?"

"My brother," said Aberforth curtly.

"A very dangerous, very clever old wizard who's a constant thorn in our side, even from another country. And a man who, once upon a time, saw to it that you were placed with your aunt and uncle, completely removed from our society," said Scrimgeour.

"Now, Harry, you have to understand, we're looking out for you here," said Fudge, instantly shifting into an approximation of a soothing, comforting smile. "We just want to make sure that man didn't…" he trailed off.

"Influence you," finished Scrimgeour.

"I told you, I've never seen him before," said Harry. He was starting to get a nasty feeling about the direction of the conversation.

"Of course you haven't!" said Fudge. "But, Harry, that man is a powerful wizard. You could be Confunded and not even know it."

"Does he look Confunded, Fudge?" said Aberforth.

"Well, no, not as such," said Fudge, hands fluttering in consternation. "Best to be sure, all the same. Precautions. Procedure. Can't be helped."

"Enough of this," snapped Scrimgeour. "Do it, Proudfoot."

Harry barely had time to brace himself. Auror Proudfoot stepped forward, his wand leveled at Harry. Harry felt a moment of panic, and a strong urge to rush forward and punch the Auror in the face.

"Legilimens!" cried Proudfoot.

The world melted away. Harry was vaguely aware that he'd crumpled to the floor, but his senses were assaulted by a stream of input. Memories, vivid and quick. He was four, and Dudley was stealing his food. Flick. He was six, staring at the ceiling of his cupboard, listening to the family open presents on Petunia's birthday. Flick. He was eight, and at school, and he had a sinking feeling that he shouldn't have done so well on that last test. Flick. He was ten, making breakfast before anyone else was up, shivering, moving the pan aside so he could warm his hands over the heating element. Flick. He was huddled in a rainstorm, the massive figure of Hagrid bracketing the door of the little shack on the island. Flick. Flick. Flick.

Harry's life, in scrapbook form, bite-sized and fast-forwarded.

He gradually became aware of voices. Harry's face was pressed up against the thick carpet in the Headmaster's office.

"... assure you, it was quite safe…"

"… could have used a more delicate hand. We don't want…"

"…seems to have led an unassuming life with his aunt and uncle, though they seemed to be rather beastly people, even for Muggles."

"So the Headmaster was essentially correct, and this was simply a case of a talented boy being talented?"

"My probe was very thorough, sir. The boy's had a boring life, and anyone popping up and introducing him to magic would have stood out like a signal fire. He didn't even know wizards existed until he got his letter. And let me tell you, whoever was in charge of that little misadventure made a real dog's dinner of it."

"I'll thank you to keep your opinions to yourself, Proudfoot, and leave the business of running my school to me."

Harry blinked. His mouth was open against the carpet. It tasted…fuzzy. He slowly got to his feet. Everyone was looking at him, with expressions ranging from Crouch's complete lack of interest to Fudge's nervousness to what might have been a quick flash of concern from Savage.

"Ah, welcome back, my boy," said Fudge. He took a tentative step forward. "You, er, had a bit of a bad reaction to that spell. Happens sometimes. Quite unfortunate, quite unfortunate. I think the best thing for you would be to head back to your dormitory and have a bit of a kip. There's a good lad."

"Right," said Harry slowly.

He turned to go, but Scrimgeour's voice stopped him. "Your wand, Mr. Potter." Scrimgeour handed Harry the holly and phoenix feather wand. Instead of letting go at once, he held the tip a moment, locking eyes with harry. "By the way, everything said and done in this room is off-limits for discussion with anyone else. Barty?"

Crouch roused himself, taking out his wand. He swept it in a wide circle, and a bright tongue of flame sprung out, running laps around the room until the walls and ceiling were covered in fiery lines, like latitude and longitude on a globe. Harry felt a brief sensation of pressure as the lines flared once, and then faded.

"As Chief Warlock, I affirm this meeting to be a closed side session of the Wizengamot." Crouch's voice was a strong baritone, quite at odds with his thin, impeccable figure. "Let all those present keep their own council of the matters discussed."

Fudge started to usher Harry out of the office. Harry, in a daze, let him. "Don't mind the others, Harry. Just a bit of bureaucracy. You'll keep this to yourself, won't you? No need to give anyone else the wrong impression." He shook Harry's hand. "It was a pleasure to meet you, Harry. A real pleasure. Don't think we don't appreciate you helping us out today. Why, in a few years, the Ministry might be able to return the favor! You might find yourself in line for a very prestigious internship. Something to think on, Harry."

Fudge had almost maneuvered Harry out the door when the Headmaster's voice stopped them.

"Potter," said Aberforth. The corners of his mouth twitched up. "Ten points to Gryffindor for defending a friend."

Harry looked him in eye, nodded, and left.

He barely noticed the ride down the stone staircase. His thoughts were tangled, disjointed. He wasn't sure if it was the aftereffects of the mind probe, or the fact that he was generally off-balance, but it was taking him an inordinate amount of time to feel anything. His emotions eventually started trickling in as he made his way to the library. Anger at having his mind violated. Confusion that they'd apparently missed the big secret, whatever it was. Resentment at being treated like a very stupid child.

And then, practically from one step to the next, everything clicked into place. That thing the Ministry had been watching for, that they apparently feared enough that merely blocking a spell warranted the presence of three high level Ministerial staff, including the Minister – well, it was true, wasn't it? They don't know, because I don't know, thought Harry. The Headmaster's brother did influence my life. I can ride a broom, I know more magic than I should, and that's because of him. Has to be. And I can't remember… because they'd have known. That spell read my mind. He must have done something, covered it up, even from me.

Having come to that conclusion, Harry was still troubled. Messing around with his head, with his memory… even to protect him, it didn't sit right. He needed to know more. He needed to remember. And the meeting he'd just left had provided him with one fat clue where to start.

One thing he was almost sure of: Privet Drive wasn't where he'd be spending the summer, one way or another.

Harry found himself breaking into a huge smile. He'd been treated badly, had his mind violated, had his wishes run roughshod over by the Ministry, had his Headmaster stand by and watch it happen, and he was the only one who'd left that meeting knowing more than when he'd entered.

Serves those bastards right, he thought with a rush of vindictive satisfaction.

He entered the library in a very good mood indeed. Cho and Cedric were at one of the tables, heads close together in conversation. They looked worried, tense. They hadn't seen him yet.

Harry schooled his features into a placid, casual expression, slowed his purposeful stride to a mere amble, and started wandering in their direction. I'm probably a bad person for doing this, he thought, but it's not like I'll get another opportunity.

When he was about fifteen feet away, Cedric heard him coming and glanced up. His eyes went wide, as did Cho's when she looked up. They stood as one and raced to Harry's side.

"Harry," said Cedric, looking relieved and anxious at the same time. "Are you okay? Did they… do anything to you?" His voice dropped to a fearful whisper at the end.

Harry summoned his best 'vaguely puzzled' expression as he regarded them. "I'm sorry, do I know you?"

The twin look of shock and dismay on his best friends' faces was too much; Harry broke down laughing after only a few seconds.

"You… you… " Cho was sputtering, incoherent.

Cedric smacked the side of Harry's head. "That wasn't funny."

Harry was laughing too hard to feel it. "I'm sorry," he managed, gasping for air. "But you should have seen your faces."

"We've been worrying about you!" said Cho. "We had that whole thing planned with the list of trigger words in case you got Obliviated, and the three people we left messages with, and the sock in Cedric's room that he turned inside out to remind us something was wrong in case they got all of us, and you made a joke out of it!"

Harry was calming down, just barely chuckling now. "But it was such a good joke, Cho. And it's not like I'd get another chance to pull it…"

Cedric smacked his shoulder, but with less conviction. "It was only a little funny."

They sat down at the table, Harry sandwiched between his friends. "So, I can't tell you much," said Harry. Experimentally, he opened his mouth to start describing the meeting in the Headmaster's office, and felt a curious sensation, like he was standing on a frozen lake, and had just heard the sharp, musical twang of the ice starting to crack.

Harry cocked his head to the side, considering. "I'm not sure what happens, exactly, if I tell you, but at the very least, I'd get in trouble."

"Okay," said Cedric. He started cleaning up their table, and Harry noticed that several of the books had to do with wizarding law. One rather thin tome was the official Hogwarts Charter. Harry was touched by the gesture, and curious just how far Cedric and Cho would have gone if he'd come back from the meeting with more memory problems.

"I have a clue now, though," said Harry. "There are like sixteen reasons why we can't talk about it much, including the fact that an invisible Auror could be listening to everything we say. So for now, just know that I think things are good, in general. That, and I…I wanted you to know that I really appreciate you guys looking out for me."

"Of course, Harry," said Cho, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. Cedric nodded the same way.

"Right." Harry cleared his throat and tried again. "Right. Anyway. Tell me exactly what happened with Smith after I left. Did the snow-monster do anything else? Does he think he's about to be interrogated by Aurors? Tell me everything!"

The three friends sat close together, talking in low voices of nothing consequential until Madam Pince kicked them out an hour later.

The Hufflepuff Basement had low ceilings and lots of earth tones. Circular windows studded the walls, and sunlight filtered in, even though it was cloudy and snowing outside. One wall was dominated by a roaring fireplace, and copper lamps hung from the ceiling. It was almost aggressively cozy.

Harry, Cho, and Cedric sat in front of the fireplace, surrounded by torn wrapping paper.

"I thought we had a deal, Harry," said Cho. She was holding up a pair of fur-lined gloves, shaking them in Harry's direction.

"They're not from me, Cho. They're from Hedwig."

The owl in question was currently perched on Cho's shoulder. Hedwig gave a short bark of agreement.

"You two are ganging up on me," said Cho. She was frowning, but Harry saw through it to the ghost of a smile in her expression. "You weren't supposed to get me anything, that was the deal we had when you got the brooms. Now you're just cheating."

"Cho," said Harry. "Are you really going to refuse a gift from Hedwig? I think she'd be pretty upset. And it's not a big gift, just a pair of gloves. I overhe – Hedwig overheard you tell Marietta that you hated how cold your hands got in the winter."

Cho scowled at him for a second, then turned to Hedwig, ruffling her feathers. "Well, you're a very thoughtful owl, Hedwig."

"I notice that Hedwig got me a Kwikspell course," said Cedric dryly, holding up the thin packet. "And it looks like she's very helpfully highlighted Lesson One, 'Holding Your Wand: Some Useful Tips'. Quite the sarcastic owl you've got there, Harry."

Harry ran a hand through his hair, hiding a smile. "Well, I reckon Hedwig's still a bit sore over the whole Engorgement Charm incident. Can't blame her for holding a grudge. Long memories, owls."

"I thought that was elephants," said Cedric.

"Either way," said Harry. "And you'll notice that I got you something, too."

"I did notice that." Cedric hefted the dark green case and peered inside. "A broomstick-servicing kit! Thanks, Harry."

"You're welcome." Harry felt warm and lazy. He leaned back against an overstuffed armchair. A beat-up record player in the corner was playing jazzy versions of Christmas standards by a brass quintet. There wasn't anyone else in the room. Three half-finished mugs of hot chocolate sat by the fire, keeping warm. It was a good day.

"Who's that from, Harry?" asked Cho, pointing to Harry's last present. It was long and thin, and wrapped in newspaper.

"It's from Hagrid," said Harry. He unwrapped it, and uncovered a beautifully carved wooden flute. It was roughly cut and unvarnished, but the craftsmanship was superb. "I feel bad," he said, balancing it on his knee. "Hagrid showed me all around Diagon Alley, and I haven't visited him at all this year."

"No time like the present," said Cedric cheerfully, hopping to his feet. "Let's pop over to the kitchens and take him some food."

"Hang on," said Cho. She reached behind her and came out with two envelopes. "I haven't given you two your gifts." She held them out, one in each hand.

Harry took one, ran his finger under the seal, opened it, and started to read. After a few moments, he looked up. Cho was looking at the two of them nervously.

"We're going to Quidditch camp?" said Cedric, breaking into a big, goofy grin.

"Technically, it's not just Quidditch. It's all kinds of broom sports. And you'll have to buy an international Portkey; they're kind of pricey." Cho still looked nervous. "My parents are sending me as a reward for getting into Ravenclaw. It's a week at the end of the summer, and I thought, you know, the three of us…"

"I think it's brilliant, Cho," said Harry.

Cedric dropped the letter and drew Cho to her feet, going in for a hug. Harry saw Cho's surprised look melt into a pleased smile with a bit of a blush as she returned it.

"I definitely want to go," said Harry. "I really don't know what's going on with me this summer. I know I haven't been able to talk about it, but if I'm right, I can probably go."

Cedric pulled back from the hug and looked at Harry. "I wouldn't think your aunt and uncle would go for that," he said carefully.

"No, they wouldn't." Harry gave Cedric a meaningful look.

"Right." Cedric stood up. "Come on, then. Hagrid's, more food, maybe a little flying before it gets dark, Christmas dinner in the Great Hall, then we come back here and hang out. It'll be the best Christmas ever."

Harry couldn't argue with that.



* * *



Defense Against the Dark Arts was held in a classroom on the third floor, and it wasn't Harry's favorite. Doge was an indifferent teacher at best, and for a dangerous, edgy criminal who was constantly being observed by Aurors, he was remarkably boring in class. He taught in a calm, even drone and he didn't get frustrated when the class was having trouble with a spell, but he didn't seem to particularly care when they did something right, either.

Harry was sitting in the back of the classroom, bored. His textbook was open to the section describing the theoretical underpinning of the Disarming Charm, but he wasn't looking at it. He'd read it ages ago. Instead, he was looking over at his classmates.

Cormac McLaggen held court in the center of the class, the rest of the Gryffindor first year boys surrounding him like lemmings. Harry shared a dormitory with those four, but that was about all he shared. They were polite, they talked sometimes, they said hello at meals – but they were indifferent to Hogwarts.

It was something Harry couldn't wrap his mind around. Even Cho and Cedric, who'd grown up knowing about the ancient, magical castle, had been caught up in Harry's enthusiasm. You could find something amazing just by walking around. And they did. Hardly a week went by when the three of them didn't find some new quirk, some fascinating, small secret. A mirror in the fourth-floor boy's bathroom that read you your height and weight. A row of suits of armor that produced different musical tones when you tapped their helmets with a wand. A staircase that led, impossibly, from the east section of the third floor to the west section of the third floor, except for a fifteen-minute window every day where it led to a balcony with a breathtaking view of the sun rising over the Black Lake.

And all of it was wasted on his dorm-mates. They treated magic like it was work. They groaned and griped at practicing spells, at learning theory that would help them understand, and thus be better at spells.

They learned by rote, not by wonder. And for that, Harry was forever divorced from them.

Harry looked up as Professor Doge's voice cut across the classroom.

"That's it for the day. Next week, we'll begin reviewing material for the end-of-term test." He had to raise his voice over the scraping of chairs and low hum of conversation that sprung up. "Homework for the weekend: an essay, to be handed in Monday, on theoretical uses of the Disarming Charm beyond its accepted, practical use. Read the chapter again if you're stuck; there are hints in the theory."

Harry scooped his textbook into his bag and stood, joining the crowd as they filed from the classroom.

"Mr. Potter, stick around for a minute," called Professor Doge.

Harry felt like a boulder in a stream as he stopped mid-stride and the flow of students rushed around him. He waited until the classroom emptied and then turned to Professor Doge, who, as always, was flanked by the ever-silent Aurors Proudfoot and Savage, who stood a respectful distance away, but were keenly watching as Harry approached.

"Yes, Professor?" said Harry, adjusting his book bag over his shoulder as it started to slip.

"I wanted to return your last essay personally, Mr. Potter," said Doge, reaching into his desk and pulling out a roll of parchment. "As I've noted on your work before, your conclusions are good, but you have a tendency to fail to show your work. One well-researched and well-supported argument is worth ten educated guesses. I had to mark you down for it, this time."

"Right," said Harry. He frowned. He didn't obsess over his marks, but off the top of his head, he couldn't recall Doge getting on his case for this before.

Doge handed him the parchment roll. "Please pay strict attention to my corrections, and I think you'll understand why I had to give you the mark I did."

"Of course, Professor," said Harry. He took the parchment and slipped it into his bag. He was very aware of the Aurors watching him.

"Well?" said Doge as Harry dawdled. "Off with you, Potter."

Harry left, already thinking ahead to History of Magic and what homework he could get done from other classes while Binns droned on.

It wasn't until after dinner that Harry remembered Professor Doge's words. He was sitting at a table in the Gryffindor Common Room, reaching into his bag, just about to start his Transfiguration homework, when the roll of parchment slipped out.

Frowning, Harry unrolled it. Professor Doge's comments were written in the margins in an untidy scrawl of red ink. They were unremarkable, and amounted to what he'd said in the classroom: Harry needed to be more diligent and methodical.

It was the grade that caught his eye. C+ was written in large text in the bottom corner. That's not a standard grade, thought Harry. He drummed his fingers on the table. Something didn't add up. Normally, this would be the kind of thing Cho or Cedric could help with, but they weren't here. This whole "different Houses" thing is pretty inconvenient.

Harry looked around the room, zeroing in on Katie Bell, who was curled up in a chair reading a worn, dark green tome called Birds of Friendship and Flame: A Phoenix Compendium. Harry wandered over to her.

"Hey, Harry," said Katie amicably, glancing over the top of the book.

"Hey, Katie. What're you reading?"

She hefted the book, showing off the title. "Angelina and Alicia were telling me this Hogwarts story about how there's a wild phoenix that lives in the Forbidden Forest. I kind of thought they were messing with me, so I got this book to prove them wrong."

Harry sat cross-legged in front of her. "And?"

She held out her hand, palm down, and rocked it side to side. "Hard to say. Phoenixes are really incredibly magical, and wild ones aren't found unless they want to be. People say there are werewolves in the Forbidden Forest, though, so it's probably just a stupid story."

Harry hummed. He held out his essay. "What do you make of this, Katie?" He indicated the bottom of the parchment.

"That's weird." She leaned forward. "I don't think I've ever gotten a mark like that. What's it stand for? Clueless?"

"Ha ha. No, it's a Muggle thing. Doge has never marked your stuff with Muggle grades?"

"No. He's a bit dotty, though. Maybe he just forgot. Is C+ a good Muggle mark?"

Light bulb, head, illumination. Harry bolted to his feet. "Uh. About average. Anyway, thanks Katie."

He barely heard her answer as he ran up the stairs to the first-year boy's dormitory. Thankfully, no one else was there. He climbed onto his bed and yanked the curtains shut, then pulled out his wand.

All it had taken was hearing it out loud. It was pathetically simple, and Harry was torn between being offended that Doge thought it needed to be that easy, and embarrassed that it had taken him that long.

C+. See plus.

Harry tapped the parchment three times in a measured, even beat, and on the last one, spoke. "Aparecium."

Letters faded into view, tucked in the lower left-hand corner, in the same handwriting and red ink as the notes.

Mr. Potter,

For reasons that should be obvious, I could not approach you directly.

Before she died, your mother left this in my possession. I pass it on to you, in the hopes that you will use it well.

Finite this parchment, and keep it to yourself.

-Elphias Doge

Harry sat on his bed, holding the parchment, unmoving, for about a minute.

"Okay…" he said out loud. He thought about it. Doge had been a member of the Order. The Headmaster's brother Albus had been in charge of the Order. The Ministry was deathly afraid of Albus Dumbledore. Harry was pretty sure that Albus was responsible for Harry's memory loss, and only a little less sure that it had been to help him, rather than to hurt him. That meant that Doge was probably, but not definitely on his side.

"Okay," Harry said again, a little bit more confidently. He held his wand against the parchment. "Finite Incantatem."

The parchment flexed, shuddered, and then, in a flash of light, transformed into a small, leather-bound notebook. It was worn, obviously handled many times, but treated well. Harry flipped it open and looked at the inside cover. He was already pretty sure of what he'd find, but the reality of it made him tremble.

This journal is the property of Lily Evans

Harry's eyes traced the neat, feminine handwriting the way a man dying of thirst in the desert would stare at a mirage of an oasis.

When his roommates came into the dorm an hour later, Harry didn't even hear them. He was devouring the journal. His mum had started it in her fourth year, and at first it was mundane, everyday life stuff. Still fascinating, if a bit unsettling at times – it was a candid look into the mind of a fourteen-year-old girl who was also his mum, and that was…strange. But around sixth year, it started to get very, very interesting. Apparently Lily had developed interests in magical theory, Potions, and history.

There was too much to absorb. Homemade spells, started, revised, then abandoned. Potions recipes that were so far above Harry's level he couldn't even understand half the instructions. Annotated notes about various historical figures – apparently Lily had become fascinated with the history of the Founders. Harry flipped through the journal, skimming from page to page. He'd have time to savor it later, but right now, he was gorging himself. Towards the end of the journal, Lily started making references to her exploration of Hogwarts – and here, Harry felt a warm glow: a connection to his mother, something long wished for but never expected.

His eyes scanned over a section, snagged on something. Just a scribbled note at the bottom of a page.

Chamber of Secrets – Slytherin

Gallery of Refuge – Hufflepuff

Room of Requirement – Ravenclaw

Hall of Honor – Gryffindor

Harry's eyebrows climbed his forehead, and he started to read the next few pages very carefully.

Outside, unnoticed, the dark night sky faded into a grey dawn.



* * *



"This is too much."

"I know, I'm getting sick of it."

"Is it honestly that big of a deal?"

"Well… probably. Fred and George aren't helping."

"I think they're just excited about making out like bandits with that betting pool."

The compartment rocked with the motion of the train. Harry and Cedric sat on one side, and Cho, Katie, Angelina, and Alicia sat on the other. Hedwig, that traitorous owl, was perched on Cho's shoulder again.

"Did they really get all the money?" asked Harry. "That doesn't seem quite right."

"Nobody bet on the Defense Professor lasting the whole year," said Cedric. "It's kind of unprecedented. And it is a big deal. Did you see how everyone was acting the last few days? As it got closer and closer to the end of term? I think everyone was waiting for Hogwarts to get hit by a meteor or Doge to spontaneously combust."

Alicia lowered her voice. "Do you think it's true, what people are saying? Do you think it means You-Know-Who is really gone?"

Harry didn't miss the way most of their glances flicked his way for a second. He stifled a surge of irritation.

"I don't see how that could be," said Cho. "You-Know-Who was defeated more than ten years ago."

"Maybe the curse just took a while to wear off," said Angelina.

"That whole thing's just a theory," said Cedric dismissively. "Dumbledore's speech to the Wizengamot right after they exiled him spawned all kinds of nutty ideas. My dad says the Ministry still gets letters every day claiming You-Know-Who is back because they broke three teacups in a row or something. If people can blame their bad luck on something, they're going to."

"Well, I wish people would stop talking about it anyway," said Katie, shooting an irritated glare at a pair of third-years who were walking by the compartment. "It's getting annoying."

Suiting action to words, Katie launched into long spiel about Quidditch. She'd followed Harry and Cho's lead, coming back from Christmas with a "gift" for Angelina of Katie's own broom, and had been much less prone to random acts of violence since then. She channeled most of her enthusiasm into her hopes and dreams for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

"… be so much better next year once Harry and I are on the team," Katie was saying.

"I wish you'd stop assuming that, Katie," said Harry.

"No, it's pretty much a given," said Alicia. "Robert Dearborn missed half the practices to study for N.E.W.T.s, and on a good day he was an indifferent Seeker at best. You're a shoo-in, Harry."

"I still wish you'd stop saying it," muttered Harry. "Don't you guys get by now that I'm all about lowering expectations?"

Cho, meanwhile, had opened the window and was leaning outside for the fifth time in order to get a glimpse of the blue-and-bronze paintjob of the Hogwarts Express.

"Stop it, Cho," said Cedric. "We get it, you guys won."

"Knocked off the Slytherins from their perch!" she said, beaming. "Mum's going to be so proud."

"I'm as happy the Slytherins lost as anyone," said Cedric, "but gloating about it isn't going to make it easier to deal with them next year."

"Next year," said Cho, waving her hand, brushing it off like it was some distant point in the future.

The hours slipped by, and before he knew it, Harry found himself back on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. The crowd's energy was just as intense as it had been in the beginning of the year, but the flavor was different. Here, just before the summer, it was all about partings. Harry found himself struggling to get through the crowd, burdened as he was by Hedwig's cage and his trunk. All over the platform, students were finding parents, were stopping to hug other students goodbye, were scribbling hastily-composed notes and reminders about summer plans.

Harry saw Cho waving him over. He fought his way through the crowd, making his way to her.

"Harry, these are my parents," said Cho, gesturing to the man and woman standing beside her. "Mum, Dad, this is Harry. We're friends. I told you about him, remember?"

"Pleased to meet you," said Harry, sticking his hand out despite his nervousness. Cho's father took it after a moment, shook it once, and dropped it. Cho's parents wore guarded, judging looks that weren't exactly unfriendly, but weren't warm either.

"Our daughter tells us you're a talented student," said Cho's father. Then he smiled, and it was amazing how much the simple expression changed his face. "She also tells us you share her unfortunate enthusiasm for Quidditch."

"I don't know about that," said Harry, matching his smile. "I like flying, but I still barely understand the game, whereas Cho here can tell you every Seeker the Tutshill Tornados have had for the last hundred years."

"Indeed. I hear you're joining her this summer for the Moutohora Macaws Youth Training Camp. You and another boy." He put a peculiar emphasis on the last word that Harry didn't quite understand.

"Er, yes. Cedric. He's… I kind of lost track of him after we said goodbye. He's here somewhere."

Cho slipped out of her mother's reach. "I'll go find him. I want to introduce him to Mum and Dad as well." She lunged forward and threw her arms around Harry. "If I don't see you, bye for now. Have a wonderful summer. Owl me, even if it's just to vent about those lousy Muggles."

"Sure, Cho," said Harry, hugging her back. Her parents were giving him the oddest look, and for some reason Harry was very relieved when Cho pushed away and dashed into the crowd looking for Cedric.

"Um. I should probably go. My uncle isn't very patient."

"It was nice to meet you, Harry Potter," said Cho's father. Both he and Cho's mother had that guarded, weighing look again.

"You too." Harry turned and started making his way to the barrier, trying not to hurry too much.

Vernon Dursley was waiting for him on the other side. It was impossible to miss his uncle, even from a hundred feet away. No one that large and angry-looking could blend into a crowd.

"Hello, Uncle," said Harry, keeping his voice even as he approached.

Vernon ignored him. Didn't even look at him. He just went to the back of the car and opened the boot. He didn't offer to help Harry with his trunk, he just stood there, staring into the middle distance. He was, however, grinding his teeth so hard Harry could practically hear them.

"Okay, then." Harry shrugged, and hoisted his trunk into the boot. He carried Hedwig's cage with him as he slipped into the backseat. A few seconds later, Vernon wedged himself into the driver's seat, saying nothing. He started the car and they started to drive.

Five minutes later, Harry was confused. His uncle still hadn't said anything. On the whole, Harry quite preferred it, but it was still fairly unsettling.

"So… er, have a good year?" asked Harry, feeling supremely weird about trying to have a civil conversation with Vernon.

Again, Vernon didn't say a thing. He did, however, without taking his eyes off the road, reach into his coat, pull out a folded piece of paper, and toss it in the backseat. With a mental shrug, Harry picked it up and opened it. It was written in his own handwriting.

Hi, Harry! It's me, Harry. I have a bet with my godfather about how confused you'll be when you read this, so even if you have no idea what's up, go ahead and pretend that you'd figured it out when you see him. I have faith, though. I, we, whatever, have changed a lot in the past few years, and I'm betting that'll shine through.

Don't antagonize the Dursleys too much. They've been well trained to ignore your existence, but I wouldn't push it. Just head to your room when you get home, and all will be made clear.

Very respectfully,

-Harry Potter

The signature was his, though Harry had never personally thought to make the O in his name a smiley-face.

"Cheeky bastard," said Harry, and he laughed.

Number Four, Privet Drive was exactly as Harry remembered it. The lawn was neatly trimmed, the flowerbeds meticulous. Everything was impeccable and boring. Harry retrieved his trunk, and laboriously maneuvered it inside as he balanced Hedwig's cage in his free hand. Petunia and Dudley were in the living room watching television. Neither of them so much as turned to look at him. Vernon stomped in behind him, brushing past Harry to join his family in the living room, where they loudly started talking about Vernon's trip to London to buy Dudley a new bicycle.

Harry felt a strong urge to run into the living room and start dancing around madly to see if he could get a reaction out of them, but quashed it. Instead, he dragged his trunk upstairs, made a second trip down for Hedwig's cage, and opened the door of the smallest bedroom. The doorknob resisted him for a second, and then clicked open.

Harry's room was exactly as he remembered it – mostly bare, devoid of possessions – except for one massive difference. Against the side of the room, practically taking up the entire wall, was a huge antique wardrobe. The wood was dark, and so lacquered it was almost reflective. It was tall, and the outward-swinging doors had ornate brass handles on them.

As Harry walked towards it, it evoked something in him. He couldn't remember ever seeing it before, but something about it was incredibly familiar.

"I think I see what's going on here," he said. He took Hedwig's cage and set her on the bed, which, as Harry touched it, seemed to be much more comfortable than he remembered.

He went to the wardrobe and opened it. The coats seemed to go on forever; it was too dark to see the end of them.

Harry rolled his eyes. "Oh, come on." Muttering to himself, he climbed in and started brushing the coats aside. He wasn't surprised when the doors clicked closed behind him. It was almost completely dark. Harry waited. His breathing felt very loud in the enclosed space. He was starting to get a bit worried, and was just about to start blindly groping his way forward when the door in front of him opened.

Warding his eyes against the sudden light, Harry blinked and stepped forward onto a beach. The moon was startlingly bright, but most of the illumination came from a series of torches planted in the white sand. The air was warm and dry, and smelled like something Harry couldn't identify, but again carried a strong sense of familiarity.

It was also snowing.

Waiting for him as Harry stepped out of the wardrobe was a…thing. His top half was a grinning, dark-haired man who was sporting a pair of horns on his forehead, and his bottom half was a pair of goat legs with cloven feet. He was holding an umbrella, which was covered with a light dusting of snow.

He tipped the umbrella jauntily. "Hello, Harry! I'm Mr. Tumnus!"

Harry stood stock-still for about three seconds. His eyes narrowed. Then he pulled his wand out of the pocket of his jeans.

"Petrificus Totalus!"

The man dodged away from the Full-Body Bind, cursing as his goat legs wobbled. "Harry! Cut it out! Same team, Harry, same team!"

"Rictusempra!"

That one got deflected by the umbrella. "Damn goat legs," said the man. "Lupin! A little help over here?"

"Tarantallegra!"

The spell clipped him on the ankles as the man tried to dodge again, and his goat legs started jerking wildly. The man toppled to the ground. "Remus!" His voice was noticeably higher-pitched.

A man stepped into Harry's field of vision from behind the wardrobe's exit. He had worn, tired features and hair that was streaked with grey, but his smile was full and bright. "Best go easy on him, Harry. You don't want to know what he had planned until I talked him down to this."

"Hmm," said Harry. He stuck his wand back in his pocket. "Somehow, I get the feeling that he kind of deserves it."

The half-goat man on the ground was cackling to himself as pulled out a wand and applied the counter-curse to his legs. He didn't stop at that, and with a few wand-motions his legs started transforming back into human ones.

"He does at that," said the other man. He turned to regard Harry. "I'm Remus Lupin. You know me, but you don't know that."

"I kind of figured," said Harry dryly.

"No way!" said the man on the ground, who was now waving his wand carefully over the horns on his forehead. "You did not figure this out. You're just acting all cool and collected because it's your default position."

"Yeah, I got kind of a big hint when the Minister, the Head Auror, and the Chief Warlock flipped out over the fact that I blocked a spell, and – " Harry felt that sense of pressure again. "Damn."

"We know," said Remus quietly. "We can take care of the binding spell later. But Aberforth filled us in."

"Ministry bastards," said the other man. He hopped to his feet. "I'm Sirius Black, although I don't know why I'm telling you since you're going to remember everything in about five minutes." He glanced up at the snow, which seemed to be coming from nowhere. "Take care of that, would you, Remus? I was always pants at weather."

Lupin pulled out a wand and swept it in a wide arc. "Meteolojinx Recanto!" The snow immediately stopped falling.

Sirius gestured grandly down the beach. The torches seemed to mark a path towards the shoreline. "Shall we?"

Harry looked over his shoulder. The wardrobe was sitting there in the sand, looking dreadfully out of place. "Should we get my stuff?"

"Later," said Remus. "We'll move the wardrobe back to the house. And, unfortunately, you'll be using it all summer, so there's no rush."

They started walking down the beach. Sirius walked a few paces ahead, flicking his wand at the torches, making them flash brilliantly with various colors, grinning all the while.

"Using it all summer?" said Harry.

"It's the compromise we came up with," said Remus, shrugging. "When you go to bed, you go back through the wardrobe to the Dursleys and sleep there. The bedroom's charmed so they can't go in. They'll leave you alone."

"Huh," said Harry. "I suppose this is going to make a bit more sense once I get my memories back?"

Sirius looked back over his shoulder, his eyes narrowing. "Just how much do you think you know about what's going on right now? You might just be faking this whole 'taking it in stride' thing. I want some proof before I pay up."

"I know that sometime after I turned seven, one of you came for me," said Harry calmly. "And I know Albus Dumbledore is involved." He looked around. "I know that I've spent a lot of time here. This place feels familiar. I know that you guys are on the outs with the Ministry, and for some reason you knew they'd read my mind at some point, so you made sure there wasn't anything to read. We're going to have a long conversation about that, by the way. And I know you have an agent at Hogwarts."

Sirius and Remus exchanged a long glance. Remus quirked an eyebrow. "Told you."

"Balls," said Sirius. "Fine, Harry, I owe you ten Galleons."

"How'd you know about the agent at Hogwarts?" asked Remus.

"Well, it's pretty obvious," said Harry. "I mean, he started this year, he used to be part of the Order. Doge even gave me –"

"Hang on," interrupted Remus. "Doge?"

"Yeah?" said Harry.

"Doge isn't our guy at Hogwarts," said Sirius slowly. "Snape is."

Harry felt his mouth go dry.

"Doge pretty much hates Albus these days, and Aberforth isn't exactly his favorite person," said Remus. "They were all very close, of course, but after Ariana went to St Mungo's…"

"Remus, he's going to remember it all in thirty seconds, there's no point in telling it all over again."

"Snape?" said Harry, his voice a little shrill. Doge had given him his mother's journal, but if he wasn't part of this conspiracy, then what game was he playing? Harry couldn't even process it right now; his mind was elsewhere. "Seriously. Snape?"

"Seriously," echoed Sirius. "He's not my favorite person, but he's on our side. Why? Did he give you a hard time?"

"A bit," said Harry. He looked around. They were almost at the water's edge. "Is he here too? Where is this, anyway?"

"This is a small, private island two kilometers off the coast of Greece," said a voice from the darkness. A circle of torches sprang to light, surrounding a pedestal with a wide, stone bowl. Behind it stood a wizened old man in a bright blue robe with gold moons and stars embroidered on it. Harry recognized him from the portrait in the Headmaster's office. "It is the sometime residence of Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel, and the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix."

Albus Dumbledore broke into a wide, kind smile. "Forgive me, Harry, for indulging Sirius's penchant for the dramatic."

"You didn't protest too hard, Albus," said Sirius, going to stand by his side.

"Can we get on with this?" asked Harry. "It's been a long year of doubting my sanity and not trusting my own mind. I'd rather not spend more time doing that than I have to."

"Right. Sorry, Harry," muttered Sirius. He waved Harry forward. The stone bowl was filled with swirling light. Most of it was silvery and seemed almost like a liquid, but ripples of gold popped up here and there, and every now and then, bubbles burst to the surface in a prismatic spray of color.

"This will be quite disorienting, Harry," said Dumbledore as he drew his wand. Harry peered over the edge of the bowl, entranced. "It was a very complex spell that modified the Pensieve in this way, storing your memories and removing them completely from your mind. With luck, the false memories we concocted will simply fade away like fog in the sunlight, your true memories settling into their well-worn paths. Alas, the mind is a complex, many-layered thing, and certainty is never possible. I think it quite likely that even if all goes as planned, your old memories will take some time to integrate completely. I tell you this, merely to make you aware of the dangers ahead."

"In other words," said Sirius, "don't panic."

Harry looked up at Dumbledore. "Do it."

Dumbledore twirled his wand, his expression one of pure focus as he dipped his wand into the bowl, stirring. A few seconds went by, and Dumbledore gave the tiniest of frowns, and for a brief second, Harry's heart dropped into his boots. Then Dumbledore's wand stopped moving, snagged on something. "Oho," said Dumbledore happily as he fished up a glowing band of liquid light. He drew it, very slowly, to Harry's temple.

"This is going to feel… quite odd," said Dumbledore, and the band of light brushed against his skin.

Harry had enough time to see the bowl draining at an alarming rate, and to feel a curious sensation, not unlike what he imagined it would feel like if someone parboiled his brain. Then he blacked out.

…

A high, cold laugh and a green flash of light. No, that's too far. A motorcycle in the air. Snow. A half-goat man. No, that's too far the other way. Light. No light. A cupboard.

Ah.

…

The first time Harry saw his godfather, Sirius Black scared him terribly. He was nice at first, and Harry didn't believe half the things he said when they talked out in the garden, but he was kind and unlike anyone Harry had ever met, but his face kept getting colder as Harry told him about his own life, and Harry knew he was doing something wrong, and later, after Sirius saw the cupboard, he had a terrible expression on his face. He unfroze the Dursleys, and he said, "If you say one word to my godson, from now until the end of your miserable lives, just one word, I will kill you." It wasn't the words that really scared Harry, it was the voice.

…

"It would have been a mere formality. I gave a statement that you were the Potters' Secret-Keeper. You were found laughing, quite madly, I would add, over the corpses of twelve Muggles and the bloody finger of Peter Pettigrew. Given your close ties to James and Lily, and given their status as heroes of the war, I believe Minister Bagnold feared what a very public, well-publicized trial would reveal." Harry listened through the door as Sirius argued with Dumbledore. He was supposed to be back through the wardrobe by now, sleeping back in England, but the conversation was too interesting to miss. They were talking about when Sirius went to Azkaban, and Sirius never talked about that. "They thought… they thought I was having an affair with Lily?" Sirius started making a choking noise that sounded like it was half laughing and half crying.

…

Harry sat with Sirius at a café in Paris. He'd just turned ten, and this wasn't his idea of a fun birthday. "That's it," said Sirius. "Now look more pathetic. No, not angry, pathetic. Remember, you're an orphan. And I'm your handsome, compassionate godfather who has raised you all by himself. Is she looking?"

…

Remus's lessons were never dull, but Harry couldn't call them terribly exciting. He liked it when Remus got off on a tangent, though. It happened a lot when he started talking about the state of magical Britain. Sometimes, it dovetailed into what could reasonably be called a rant, especially if a full moon was coming up and Remus was getting antsy. "It's almost as bad as the war, it's just not as obvious," said Remus. "No, that's not true. It's fine. For some people. Not everyone. Not for me. If I went back there, if I did nothing but walk down the street and stay at an inn for a week, I'd be arrested. Guaranteed. They never realized what they had when Dumbledore was running things. He was a moderating influence. With the Council of Magical Law folded into the Wizengamot, Barty Crouch having free rein to persecute so-called traitors… no one really talks about it, but it's two steps removed from McCarthyism." Remus blinked. "What were we talking about?"

…

They always went bowling after their lessons. Dumbledore was cheerfully infuriating, and Harry was always a bit steamed after another lesson of abstract concepts he barely understood, and nothing else. He took out his frustration on the pins, though he hardly ever won. Harry and Dumbledore sat on cheap plastic seats between games. "I don't get why you won't teach me anything useful," groused Harry. Dumbledore regarded him calmly, those electric blue eyes forever unfazed. "Are you so sure that I am not, Harry?" "I'm sure you haven't taught me a single spell," said Harry. "I'm sure that Voldemort is out there, and I'm going to need to know spells." "I am not sure," said Dumbledore quietly, and he looked old and wise and legendary and sad and vastly out of place in a bowling alley. "I was sure, once. I was absolutely sure that I needed to rule the world for its own good, and I was absolutely wrong." His voice dropped almost to a whisper. "I will never be sure again."

…

Nicolas and Perenelle unnerved the hell out of Harry. They weren't around very often, but when they were, they were memorable. Nicolas, when he bothered, was dry and sarcastic and charming and sometimes said something offhand about magic that floored Harry and sent him reeling back to the library to study for a week. Perenelle told the most marvelous stories, and Harry was positive that when she looked at him, there was genuine affection on her face. But both of them had this habit of going still and quiet and not moving for minutes, even hours. They perceived time on a different scale. And sometimes, when they looked at Harry, Harry wondered if they saw anything significant at all.

…

Snape spent as little time on the island as possible. When Harry was nine, Snape began spending more of his summer on the island trying to teach Harry Occlumency. Dumbledore had begged off, as his schedule was too irregular with the ICW. "This is pointless," said Snape, two weeks into the training. Harry was nursing a fierce headache, and Sirius was facing off with Snape in the other room. "Teaching a child even basic Occlumency is a fool's errand, even if he was the most self-disciplined child in the universe, which Potter is decidedly not." Sirius's voice had an edge to it. "Harry knows what's right, and he acts on it. Wearing your heart on your sleeve isn't a bad thing." Harry could practically feel Snape's sneer. "It is, Black."

…

Harry was nine years old, and Sirius had insisted he be a part of the meeting. Snape had rushed back to the island, and he looked pale and worn. He'd never once come unannounced, in the middle of the school term. They stood there in the living room in a loose circle. Sirius, with Harry by his side. Remus. Dumbledore. Snape. Nicolas and Perenelle, for once seeming very interested in the conversation. Slowly, Snape pushed up the sleeve of his robe, baring his left arm. There was something there – a mark. "The Dark Lord's power rises. You failed, Lupin." Remus looked away. "Are we sure it's Peter? He couldn't have found someone else?" asked Sirius. "How far are you willing to stretch coincidence to spare your friend's feelings?" said Snape scathingly. "Last year he lost the trail in Albania. Dumbledore's ICW contacts reported rumors of a dark presence in the forests of Albania." Dumbledore stirred. He'd been lost in thought, now he looked around, taking the measure of them all. "I fear we must adapt our plans greatly."

Harry opened his eyes. He was on his back, looking at the stars. He raised his head and saw that the scene in front of him had barely changed. Dumbledore, Sirius, and Remus stood around the stone bowl, chatting. Harry leaped to his feet, strode over to Sirius and slugged him in the chest.

"You owe me twenty Galleons, you git!"

Chapter 4 – A Lion in Winter

Harry's excitement for Quidditch Camp had dimmed over the summer for two reasons. The first reason was that it was the first summer since he'd started learning a hodgepodge of magical theory from some of the greatest minds in the entire world that he had the use of his own wand. It was like he'd been reading about famous chefs and cooking tips and secret recipes for four years, and now he was finally allowed in the kitchen. Cutting into his studies for a week seemed a lot less appealing than it had at the beginning of the summer.

The second reason was that New Zealand in August was cold. No one had mentioned the whole "inverted seasons" thing. Warming Charms and winter robes helped, but it still wasn't exactly pleasant.

"Remind me again whose idea this was?" asked Cedric, blowing warm air into his hands and rubbing them together vigorously.

Harry, Cho, and Cedric were walking off a professional Quidditch pitch along with a couple dozen other youths. They were definitely in the lower range, age-wise. Harry could hear the babble of five or so separate languages wash over him as the crowd made its way off the pitch and into the training complex.

"I know it's not exactly comfortable, but we've learned loads, haven't we?" said Cho as they followed the crowd to the cafeteria.

"One entire day out of the seven that we're here to drill Arresto Momentum into our heads," said Cedric.

"Well, it's a safety thing, isn't it? And we can use magic here, that's nice, right?" said Cho, starting to sound a bit desperate.

"I like it," said Harry firmly. "We're learning from professional Quidditch players, and the worst person here could fly rings around most people at Hogwarts. I'm glad we came," he said, looking at Cedric meaningfully.

"Right," said Cedric, taking Harry's hint. "I didn't mean I wasn't having a good time or anything. This was a really good idea. I'm glad we're here, Cho!"

"Laying it on a bit thick, mate," muttered Harry.

The atmosphere inside the cafeteria was blessedly warm and comfortable. After piling their plates with carbohydrates, the three of them made a beeline for an empty table. The short time they'd been there, combined with the other kids' ages and the frequent language barrier had made their group insular. Not that Harry minded, particularly. In fact, today he was quite glad of that fact.

"So," said Harry as they sat down, "what did you two sign up for this afternoon?" He started playing with his silverware nervously. He'd asked an easy question to start with, and was psyching himself up for a much tougher conversation.

"I put myself down for Tactics and Strategy again," said Cedric. "The Hufflepuff team is really coordinated, and they work really well together, but they're not very creative. They're bringing back the whole Chaser line next year, as well as both Beaters, and if I can bring some new plays to the table, it could be huge for us."

"Don't know how you can stand that one, Cedric," said Cho, wrinkling her nose. "I took it the first day and nearly fell asleep. Who wants to be in a classroom when you can be up in the air? I'm doing Seeker Skills. Did you see those guys drilling yesterday?"

"I saw how you kept pestering that older kid," said Harry, grinning at her. "He seemed kind of ticked off, though it's hard to tell because I don't think I've ever seen him not scowling since we've been here. What's his name – Vikram?"

"Viktor," corrected Cho. She leaned forward. "He's brilliant. His English isn't so good, but I think I used enough hand gestures to get my point across. He taught me a couple moves. He's…" words seemed to fail Cho. "I've never seen anyone fly like that. Ever."

"Hey," said Harry.

"Yeah, hey," said Cedric.

"You boys are quite good as well," said Cho. "Don't get all huffy." She quickly changed the subject. "What about you, Harry? Going to do another pick-up match?"

"Nah," said Harry. "I think I'm going to try Aerial Maneuvers. I'm starting to think it's not Quidditch I like so much as flying really fast and having to dodge things."

Cho, and to a lesser extent Cedric, gave him looks that communicated their disbelief of his stance.

"Anyway," said Harry, trying a final time to settle his nerves as he surreptitiously drew his wand under the table. "I wanted to bring something up. I've been meaning to talk to you guys about it, and I've been trying to find a good time, and, well, I guess this is as good a time as any."

Cho and Cedric exchanged a quick look, and then nodded. "Go ahead," said Cedric guardedly.

Harry focused. "Muffliato," he whispered. He closed his eyes for a second, trying to feel his way around the spell. "Damn. Botched it." He kept his eyes closed, slowed down his hand as he moved his wand, and cast. "Muffliato," he said in a louder, firmer voice. He opened his eyes, breathing a sigh of relief.

"What was that?" asked Cho.

"Just something to make sure we're not overheard," said Harry. He leaned forward, planting his elbows on the lacquered wooden table. "So." He suddenly wasn't sure how to start. His emotions were all over the place. He was excited to tell them, nervous about what they'd think, and desperately afraid that it would threaten their friendship.

"You got your memories back," said Cedric calmly.

Harry blinked.

"It wasn't hard to guess, Harry," said Cho, rolling her eyes. "You dropped enough hints that you'd figured something out, something big, and you weren't worried about the summer at all."

"Right," said Harry, nodding. He dropped his eyes to the table for a second, and then looked up. "And I need to know if you want to know about it. You saw what happened with the Auror. When I got to the Headmaster's office, I got run over by a bunch of Ministry people wanting to know how I'd blocked that spell, and when I couldn't give a good enough explanation, they had an Auror use Legilimency on me."

Cho gasped, and Cedric's eyebrows rose. "That's… I don't know if that's illegal or not, but even if it's not, it's pretty harsh," said Cedric. "Even at the Death Eater trials, they hardly ever –"

"Are you okay, Harry?" interrupted Cho.

"I'm fine," said Harry. "They didn't find anything, and that ended up kind of clarifying things for me. They were all worked up about the Headmaster's brother, worried he'd corrupted me or something, so I figured that was probably what had happened, but in a good way. They even had the Chief Warlock use some kind of binding spell so I couldn't talk about any of this, but luckily I happen to know a former Chief Warlock who knows how to remove it." Harry took a deep breath. "Before I say anything else, I want to give you guys the chance to back out. Knowing this stuff could be risky. Not 'I might get detention' risky, either. You could get hurt."

Cho opened her mouth, and Harry could tell she was about to wave off all of his worries. He made his voice cold. "You could get other people hurt, too."

That sobered them up.

"I'm not saying we're going to chase Dark wizards down the halls of Hogwarts, or overthrow the Ministry, but if I let you two into my circle, when we go back, school and Quidditch aren't going to be the only things I'm working on." Harry clasped his hands and leaned back. He hoped the message had gotten through.

It took them only a couple seconds. Harry was surprised, and relieved, and surprised that he was relieved.

"Tell us," said Cedric. Cho nodded in agreement.

Harry blew out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. "Okay. What do you know about a wizard named Sirius Black?"

It took the rest of the lunch break for Harry to explain the circumstances behind Sirius's imprisonment and subsequent escape from Azkaban. He found himself having to continually retreat further into the past, drudging up details that he himself was foggy on. Sirius and Remus talked about Harry's parents willingly enough, but neither of them brought up Peter Pettigrew casually, and both were reluctant to go into detail about their globetrotting, seven-year search for the man.

"This is huge," whispered Cho as the three of them walked over to the bins, depositing the remains of their lunches. "I remember when I was really little, my parents talked about Black sometimes. Like, they were afraid to go outside at night because he might be out there somewhere. I guess that stuff died down over the years. But still, finding out that it was all a big mistake… is that why they went looking for the other man – Peter, was it?"

"Partly," said Harry, very aware that they'd left the safe confines of the Muffliato spell. "If they found Peter, they could clear Sirius's name. But there was another reason. I'll have to save that for next time." The cafeteria was emptying, everyone heading outside for the afternoon session. Harry hesitated. "I don't need to tell you to keep this to yourselves, right?"

"Of course," said Cedric. He'd worn a perpetual frown that had gotten deeper and deeper as Harry had spun his tale. "This is going to take some getting used to, though. So he was the one who…raised you, I guess, when you were seven?"

"Yeah. There's so much more I have to tell you. It'll have to wait until dinner, I guess." The three of them seemed to be the last ones left in the cafeteria.

Harry started to move, but Cedric stopped him. "Harry. Thanks for trusting us with this."

"I couldn't not tell you, you know?" said Harry. He looked away, staring off into the middle distance. It was less embarrassing that way. "It wouldn't feel right. I know it's a bit risky, telling you two, what with the Ministry keeping an eye on me, but I don't care. It means something to me, having you know." He cleared his throat roughly.

"Well, it means something to hear it," said Cedric, giving Harry a friendly nudge of the shoulder. "Come on, we'll be late." He started to move toward the exit.

Cho didn't say anything, but her expression said a lot. She slung an arm over Harry's shoulder – ever since he'd turned twelve last month, Harry had been holding out hope for a growth spurt, but no such luck: Cho still had about an inch on him – and they made their way outside, bundling up against the cold.



* * *



Only five of them had signed up for that afternoon's Aerial Maneuvers class, which suited Harry just fine. The instructor was a Chaser for the Moutohora Macaws, a team famed for its speed and showmanship. He was broad-shouldered, very tan, and seemed to wear a perpetual grin.

Without a word, he directed Harry and the other four onto their brooms and into the air, up and out of the stadium, until they were stationed in a controlled hover a few hundred feet in the air. He reached into a pocket of his thick Quidditch robes and pulled out a scrap of parchment. He looked up, scrutinizing Harry and the others.

"Three of you speak English, correct?" he asked. Harry raised his hand along with two other boys.

"Good." He grinned at them. "I'm Petera Zhang. We're going to ditch all those silly Quidditch drills and do some honest-to-goodness flying. Sound good?" He barely waited for three eager nods. "Good. Now hang on while I bring the others up to speed."

Petera cocked his head at the remaining boy. "Sprechen Sie Deutsch?" The boy nodded curtly, and Petera rattled off a series of what Harry guessed were instructions in the harsh-sounding language.

Turning to the last student, who happened to be the only girl, Petera clicked his tongue. "Sorry, my French is pretty bad. I just need to know if that's your first language. Uh… parlez-vous français?"

The girl, who had her silvery-blonde hair pulled into a loose ponytail, gave him a withering glare and replied in rapid-fire French. Harry thought he caught the word "accent," and combined with the disparaging tone, the message was pretty clear.

Petera just shrugged. He stuffed the parchment back into his robes and drew out his wand. He swept it in a broad arc encompassing the group, then brought it to his lips. He tapped his wand against his lips three times.

"Everyone hears me?"

The voice came from Petera, but it was distorted, fuzzy. Harry had to strain to hear him, even though he was only a few feet away. Still, he nodded along with the rest of them.

"Good," said the buzzy, faint voice. "Translation Charms are fickle. Not good. Broad meaning only." He pointed to his left, out past the training complex where the neatly-trimmed fields gave way to a dark, thick forest. "Everyone follows me. We fly now. Keep up, if you are able." He followed that last statement with a grin that threatened to split his face in two, and then pivoted his broom on a crazy axis until he was hanging almost upside-down, then flattened himself along the handle and shot off in the direction he'd pointed.

Harry didn't stick around to see if the other students followed; he pitched forward on his broom and dove after the instructor.

Petera led the group on a convoluted, zigzagging path around the edges of the training complex. He looked back a few times, casually, to keep tabs on everyone, but most of his focus seemed to be on pulling off heart-stopping twists and turns that took them alarmingly close to the sides of buildings.

They came to a stop at the edge of the forest. It was all wilderness in front of them, as far as the eye could see. A river bisected their field of vision, and snow-capped mountains rose in the distance.

Petera inched out ahead of the group, took out his wand, held it above his head, and brought it down with an emphatic swish. A thick, golden ribbon of light burst forth, rapidly winding its way through the air, twisting down through the trees until Harry lost sight of it. Petera didn't let up, focusing on the spell for almost a minute. Then he tucked his wand away and turned to face Harry and the others.

"Golden line marks path for broom race," he said through the Translation Charm, the voice flat and monotone. "Finish is far away, there." He pointed, and Harry could see, in the distance, the tiny golden line poking up from the forest and leading to a hazy, glimmering shape hanging in the air. It was hard to tell, but it looked several miles away, at least. "First one to pass through golden box at finish, wins. But: must make contact with golden line every ten seconds. Follow path. Take shortcuts if you can. If you wait too long to touch line, next touch is a shock – disqualified. Turn around, come back." Petera lazily swept his broom out of the way. The golden line hung in front of them, shimmering. "Well? Go!"

And with that, they were off. Harry wasn't any quicker off the mark than any of the others – Quidditch Camp wasn't populated by people who missed a trick more than once.

Harry built an early lead mostly due to his size – he simply accelerated faster than the rest of them. He shadowed the path of the line as it started to arc down to the forest. Experimentally, Harry nudged right alongside it and swept his hand through it. It was incorporeal, but he felt a surge of warmth as his hand dipped into it.

Just as he was starting to dive towards the forest, he felt a rush of air whip at his clothes, and someone passed him, high and to the left. It was the French girl, bent low on the broom, her hand shooting out to briefly touch the line before she dove, taking a sharper angle than Harry, breaking away from the line only to connect with it again near the forest.

Smart girl, thought Harry, irritated that he hadn't thought of that. He hunched forward, coaxing every bit of speed he could out of the Cleansweep Seven. As he leveled off, he saw the first trees of the forest approach with alarming rapidity. He bared his teeth in a feral grin, dipped his foot into the line, and rocketed into the forest.

After a few seconds, Harry was having the time of his life. Sirius teaching him to fly on the island, Remus taking him on a flying carpet tour of Tibet, Albus Dumbledore guiding him through the Labyrinth of Knossos and delving deep into its ancient mysteries, Nicolas Flamel allowing him to hold the fabled Philosopher's Stone, the look on Sirius's face when Harry had conspired with Nicolas to fake turning Sirius's flying motorcycle into solid gold… these were Harry's cherished memories.

And they were all blown out of the water by this.

Harry whooped with delight as he passed so close to a tree that his feet brushed the branches as he flipped over and hauled the broom into a hard turn. Just as he righted himself, the line curved the opposite way and dove toward the ground. Harry followed.

He soon caught on to the fact that you could jump the "racetrack" if you were quick enough, and saw ahead far enough. There were points where Harry could see that the line doubled back on itself – sort of – and if you were brave, and fast, you could touch the line, then dive off course and hope it didn't take you more than ten seconds to fly the shortcut.

Catching a few glimpses of the French girl as he twisted and turned through the forest made him redouble his efforts and dial up his risk tolerance. He saw the golden line rise up out of the trees, but out of the corner of his eye he was almost sure he saw it dip back in ahead and to the right. Without even thinking about it, he broke away and to the right, barely slowing as the trees thickened and the underbrush became denser.

All of a sudden, he was in open air. He'd made it to the river. And there was the line, following it. Grinning, Harry flew alongside it and brushed it with his hand.

The sound of the girl shouting from behind him just made him grin harder. He couldn't understand her, but judging by her tone, whatever she was yelling wasn't complimentary.

The line dipped under a wooden footbridge and Harry followed, the space between the river and the bridge probably less than fifteen feet. Harry blazed through at top speed.

This is so much goddamn fun.

As he came out from under the bridge, he felt the girl behind him. He chanced a look back, didn't see her, looked forward again only to see the river starting a sharp bend, the line following it steadily, and then she was just there. Right alongside him, her expression a mirror of his own pure joy and concentration, her silvery hair fluttering arrow-straight behind her as she matched Harry's reckless speed.

The line broke off from the river; Harry could see it weaving through a clearing up ahead that was filled with sparse trees and large boulders. He followed, the girl by his side.

They tore through the clearing like a pair of slalom skiers, twisting, cutting across each other, their laughter transcending language, each dip and dive taking them closer to a tree. Or a rock.

Up ahead, Harry saw the line arcing in a gentle upward slope, continuing hundreds of feet into the sky where a shimmering golden rectangle waited. With no obstacles left, it was a matter of pure speed. He'd inched ahead of the French girl, but she was right on his tail. He gritted his teeth and lay flat on the broom, rocketing up as fast as he'd ever flown.

He could practically feel her nipping at his heels. It could have been air resistance, or broom quality, but as they darted toward the finish, she was gaining on him. Harry had practically molded himself onto the handle of the broom by that point.

It was pure adrenaline. Nothing but a last, desperate sprint to the finish. She was right beside him. They both stretched out their hands at the same time…

"Yes!" cried Harry as they broke the plane of the rectangle. He started braking gently, looking around for some magical sign he'd won. The French girl was pacing him. She looked at him scornfully.

"I won," grinned Harry. "By a finger. I saw it." It looked like she didn't quite get it, so Harry pointed to himself, then started mock-cheering.

The girl shook her head, flinging her silvery-blonde ponytail over her shoulder. "C'est n'importe quoi!" Her indignant tone carried more meaning than the actual words.

"No way," said Harry. He found himself grinning like an idiot, still riding the adrenaline from the race. He pointed to himself again. "You know who won? This guy."

The French girl stared at him for a second, and then broke into a dazzling grin. Harry hadn't gotten a good look at her before. She was older, maybe by a couple years, and she was… pretty. Her cheeks were flushed, probably from the high-speed race, but her hair was near-perfect. Harry didn't even want to know what his own looked like.

The girl reached into her robes and drew out a wand. She aimed it at a point in the distance and muttered an incantation Harry had never heard before. The golden light seemed to be like the instructor's spell, but instead of a line, it was a ball of light that sped away from them. Harry watched it as it flew away, and he had to squint as it became fainter. Just as he thought he'd lose sight of it altogether, it expanded into a recognizable glowing gold rectangle.

After stowing her wand, the girl looked over at Harry, her expression mischievous. "Ça te dit?"

Harry Potter knew a challenge when he heard one.

The next half-hour was a blur. Soaring over treetops, the wind whipping at his hair, jockeying for position with the French girl, laughing madly when he cut in front of her just as they reached the finish line, cursing her with words he'd learned from Sirius and only half-understood when she did the same to him… it was pure, unadulterated fun.

The routes grew more creative. Though the girl evidently couldn't reproduce the golden line that the instructor had conjured, she was able to cast multiple finish lines in a row, effectively creating a series of checkpoints that she strategically placed in hard-to-navigate parts of the forest. Harry found himself flying through a waterfall, under a fallen tree, and between two rocky spires, alternatingly leading and being led by the French girl.

Harry's first hint that something was amiss came when he was careening up towards the latest golden rectangle and noticed that he had to maneuver over a series of snow-covered hills to get there. His hesitation cost him, and the girl easily outpaced him, beating him handily to their latest goal.

"Hey, hold up a bit!" called Harry. He looked behind him and felt a twinge of unease. The forest where they'd started the race was just visible as a speck on the horizon.

The girl heard him, and swung her broom in a graceful arc, doubling back.

"Do you think we've gone a bit far?" asked Harry. The girl gave him a blank look, so Harry started pointing emphatically at the distant forest. The adrenaline high Harry had been riding was starting to wear off, and he realized that he was quite cold. "I think we should probably head back, don't you?" Harry tried to pantomime the question, and wasn't at all sure he'd done a good job.

A shadow fell over him.

The girl gasped. Harry zeroed in on her expression, which was one of dawning terror. Her eyes were focused on something above and behind Harry.

As it turned out, the French and English language shared a number of words. One of those words was "dragon."

"Dragon!" screamed the girl. Her eyes widened and she spun away, diving toward the ground.

Harry didn't hesitate; he tipped over ninety degrees and dove. He felt heat above him and a loud, dull whump of sound. He looked behind him and immediately wished he hadn't.

In one rather distant corner of his mind, Harry identified the huge flying lizard spewing vivid scarlet flame at the space he'd just vacated as an Antipodean Opaleye. Dumbledore's workshop on the island had lifelike statues of every breed of dragon – something to do with his research on the creatures' blood – and this one was particularly distinctive. It was beautiful, if terribly frightening at that particular moment, with glittering pearly scales and huge, multicolored, pupil-less eyes.

The larger portion of Harry's brain was preoccupied with screaming.

The snow-capped hills approached at a dizzying pace, and Harry leveled off, his heart thudding in his chest. He looked around, getting his bearings. The French girl was pacing him about a hundred feet to the left. She was gesturing frantically, though Harry hadn't the faintest idea what she was trying to communicate.

Harry heard a roar behind him and immediately took a hard angle to the ground. He went skimming along the snow-covered surface of the hills, reacting purely on instinct. He chanced another look behind him and saw that the dragon seemed torn between targets – the gout of flame was directed in Harry's wake, but the dragon was arcing and curving in the air towards the girl.

Harry cursed as the girl started looping back in his direction. "No, stay separated!" he yelled, knowing it was useless. She couldn't hear him at that distance, and even if she could, she couldn't understand him, and vice versa. As she approached, she gestured, catching his attention. She stuck out her wand and cast another one of the golden sparks that turned into rectangular finish lines – directly at the pursuing dragon.

The dragon roared in annoyance as its head was enveloped in a brilliant gold glow that lasted a scant few seconds.

Harry was nearing the girl; they were about to pass each other. He pointed down and to the right. "Make for the forest!" he shouted. She held up a hand, two fingers – and then they were past each other.

It was enough – Harry grasped hear meaning. Mentally crossing his fingers, he pulled out his own wand, flipped around with a quick loop, felt his stomach clench at how bloody close the dragon looked, and then yelled "Caecalo!"

The scintillating ball of white light connected with the dragon's head at the same instant as the French girl's golden spell. The dragon twisted in the air, almost tumbling end-over-end, completely disoriented.

"Allez!" The girl's yell needed no translation, and they simultaneously broke for the forest.

The angry roar from behind him made Harry flinch on his broom, twitching it down another few degrees, which turned out to be fortunate indeed as he felt a crackling heat near his legs. Startled, he looked over his shoulder and saw one extremely peeved dragon spewing jets of scarlet flame in all directions. The dragon wasn't following them, which was good, but the bundle of twigs on the back of Harry's broom was quite literally on fire, which was bad. The broom had also stopped responding to his grip and body position; he was flying without a metaphorical rudder.

Harry yelled in alarm and swung his feet forward, scooting up on the broom handle. It was a terrible position for any kind of aerial maneuvers, but it was preferable to having charred stumps for legs. His yell drew the girl's attention. She was pacing him as they made for the forest, and Harry saw her eyes go wide as she looked over and saw his condition. She veered towards him, and as she pulled alongside, she shouted something in French, beckoning him with her hand.

"That's bloody insane!" shouted Harry over the rushing wind. They were rapidly approaching the forest at sixty, maybe seventy miles an hour.

The girl edged closer, skillfully keeping her broom away from the burning tail of Harry's. She held out a hand. "Dépêchez-vous!"

Harry started muttering fervently under his breath as he swung his leg over the broom handle, the heat from behind him starting to ratchet up to painful levels. He didn't have any idea what he was saying, or even what language it was, only that Sirius had picked it up in Hangzhou in an incident that Remus categorically refused to talk about involving a botched Translation Charm, a holy festival, a drunken mob, a competition of some sort, and a long string of words called the Sixty-Three Sequential Sacrileges. They were lyrical and had a nice rhythm to them, and apparently used in circumstances where only the most creative blasphemies were called for.

As Harry reached out to clasp the girl's hand, he used his legs to push off from his broom. For a moment, he thought it was going to work. His knees knocked against the back of the girl's broom handle, she swung him adroitly behind her, the broom wobbling at the additional weight, but she held it steady somehow. And then Harry's broom, free from its rider, rocketed straight across their path like a loose firework, the tail ablaze.

The girl yelled and instinctively rolled away from the fiery broom. Harry overcompensated as he leaned against the motion and felt himself sliding off the side. The girl grabbed him, he grabbed her as the broom started to shudder out of her one-handed grip – there was a confusing moment where it wasn't exactly clear who was trying to steady whom – and then they were both in free fall.

Harry felt himself tumbling wildly. The ground seemed to be coming up awfully fast. He freed his wand from his robes – no mean trick as they flailed about in the wind – tried to get his bearings, saw his target, and snapped off a spell. "Arresto Momentum!"

He saw the spell impact the girl just as her own spell hit him. Harry felt himself slow down; at first it was like he was falling through water, then molasses. His feet, ever so lightly, brushed against the ground just at the edge of the forest. At the lower altitude, the snow was just a thin coating. Harry looked up in time to see the remains of his broom shoot over the tops of the trees like a comet. The girl's broom was nowhere to be seen, and the girl herself was just alighting a few feet away.

"Cedric is going to have to eat his words," said Harry. "Taking a whole day to get that spell down turned out to be pretty useful after all."

The girl raised a questioning eyebrow at him as she brushed herself off.

Curiously, Harry felt calm, though physically he was jittery from the adrenaline and shaking a bit from the cold. He focused on taking slow, deep breaths.

The girl started talking – a question, it sounded like. Harry shrugged. "Sorry, not getting it."

She shot him an exasperated glance and held up her wand. The incantation was the same unfamiliar one she'd used to create the golden race markers, but Harry was quick enough to catch the subtle way she changed the wand motion.

The bright sphere of light shot into the sky, coming to a stationary hover a few hundred feet in the air. Instead of expanding into a rectangle, it retained its spherical shape, but got brighter, pulsing with light.

"Good idea," said Harry, looking up at it. "I'm sure they're on their way by now anyway, but that'll make it a lot easier." He glanced back at the snow-covered hillside and the mountain beyond. "I'm glad Antipodean Opaleyes aren't aggressive, otherwise I'd be worried about it coming after us."

They stood there for a moment. The girl looked at him.

Harry looked at her. "I'm Harry Potter," he said. She looked at him and shook her head slightly. He pointed to himself. "Harry."

"'Arry," she echoed. Her mouth curved into a smile as she pointed to herself. "Fleur."

"Fleur," said Harry, rolling the name around in his mind. He held out his hand and she took it. Her hands were trembling slightly, just like his. "Good name."

She cocked her head, obviously trying to figure something out. "'Ogwarts?" she asked.

Harry nodded as they dropped their hands. "Yes. And you?"

"Beauxbatons."

"Bless you."

Fleur blinked. "Excusez-moi?"

"Sorry, old joke," said Harry, grinning. He sat himself down on the ground, brushing away the light coating of snow, and conjured bluebell flames. Fleur joined him, though she used some kind of cleaning spell to clear away the snow.

"It would be nice to speak the same language, but we're not doing that badly, are we?" asked Harry.

Fleur shrugged and rattled off a long string of French words. The end seemed to be a question, judging by the inflection.

"No idea," said Harry. He found himself in an unaccountably good mood.

Rolling her eyes, Fleur stuck her foot out and used it to draw a crude picture in the snow – a box with a triangle on top of it. A house?

"Ah," said Harry. "I'm in Gryffindor." She just looked at him quizzically. "You know, Gryffindor. The Lions?" Harry raised his hands and pawed at the air. "Rawr!"

Fleur started laughing. It was a nice sound, Harry thought. "Okay, so that wasn't the best lion impersonation ever."

She quieted down after a moment, and the two of them shared a companionable silence.

"I guess I should thank you for saving me back there," said Harry after a time. Fleur looked at him, just watching, listening. "We helped each other, I mean. Quick thinking, blinding the dragon like that. I didn't have a plan, myself. Why'd you cast that Arresto on me first, though? Guess I did the same thing, come to think of it. I thought if I got myself first you'd be too far away to hit accurately by the time I could throw out another one. Answered my own question, I suppose. Great minds think alike."

Harry broke into a rueful smile. "This is mental, isn't it? I know you can't understand a word I'm saying, and yet I'm still saying it. A bit liberating, in a way. I'm Harry Potter, and I'm desperately afraid my friends are going to abandon me when they find out there's a mad Dark wizard trying to claw his way back to life just for a second shot at killing me. I live on an island with my wanted criminal godfather and his werewolf best friend, along with two mad geniuses, an evil potions master, and a woman who's the closest thing I have to a mother and who also sometimes looks at people the way people look at pets."

Fleur kept looking at him, saying nothing. She was paying attention, though. She inched closer to the fire, reaching behind her head to undo her ponytail, shaking out her long mane of silvery hair.

"And that would be fine, except that Sirius says I can trust maybe half of those people," continued Harry. "Those people, by the way, are the only ones actively working on this whole Dark Lord problem. And if the wrong person knew that I knew them, well, that could go very bad, very fast. I guess what I mean is it's going to be hard to just kick back and have fun at Hogwarts this time around, now that I remember all this stuff. But that's what everyone's going to tell me to do. Sirius wants me to have a fun childhood so hard he practically beats me over the head with birthday cake."

Harry stretched out, using his elbows to prop himself up as he stared into the fire. "It's very strange being well-known for something you can't remember. You know, there was an article in the paper about me getting Sorted into Gryffindor. What am I supposed to think about that? Fred and George teased me about it, and I heard a lot of people talking about it. I'm completely baffled that anyone would care that much. And a little peeved, too. I don't want to be a symbol, or anything else besides me. It's not fair to expect anything else. And what's anyone doing paying attention to me, when it was my parents who did the thing worth paying attention to? My mum…" Harry shook his head wordlessly. "They want to raise their glass to anyone, it should be her." He sighed. The ground wasn't comfortable and his elbows were starting to hurt. "Suppose I'm rambling a bit."

He shut up. Fleur was still paying attention, though. She started talking. Harry couldn't understand her, of course, but he liked to hear her talk. She had a very pleasant voice, when it came down to it. After a while she trailed off, looking at him expectantly.

"More, huh? I guess I could tell you about Hogwarts. You'd like it, probably. That was some quick wand-work, and anyone interested in magic would be interested in Hogwarts. There's all kinds of things to discover there. One time I was in the basement, and I heard this sound like wind chimes, only it was this specific pattern, and it was coming from these tiles on the floor, and it turned out to be…"

Harry found himself talking about Hogwarts, describing the castle with his hands. When he finished a story, Fleur would start talking, and Harry paid attention to her. It was a curiously one-sided form of truth telling that felt anything but solitary.

When the phalanx of instructors from Quidditch Camp showed up, agitated and alarmed, Harry was almost annoyed at being interrupted.

"You wandered into a dragon sanctuary."

"Yeah."

"You wandered into a dragon sanctuary," said Cho, her glare almost scorching him.

"Just because you keep repeating it in that tone doesn't make it any worse," said Harry.

"How did you even get thirty miles away from the training grounds?" asked Cedric.

The three of them were sitting in the cafeteria once again. The atmosphere at dinner was drastically different than it had been at lunch. For Harry, the stares and whispers directed their way made him almost nostalgic for Hogwarts.

"I admit we got a bit carried away," said Harry. "But it's not that crazy. Brooms go pretty fast."

"Yeah, that'll hold up in court," muttered Cedric.

Harry took a long drink from his glass, surreptitiously scanning the room. "Come on, it wasn't that bad. I'm fine, Fleur's fine. Hell, the dragon's probably fine. I'm not exactly sure how those two light spells interacted, and a dragon's eyes are kind of vulnerable, and that species has really big eyes, but even so, it's… possibly fine. Cho, would you stop looking at me like that?"

"No, Harry."

"Why not?"

"Because you wandered into a dragon sanctuary."

"Actually, keep doing that," said Harry, completing his look around the room. "I think you're scaring off everyone, and sooner or later people are going to come over to talk. This might be the last chance we'll get for me to fill you in on the rest of my, er, what do you call it – "

"Life, Harry. You call it your life," said Cedric.

"Right. My life. Where did we leave it?" Harry cast another Muffliato under the table. He noted, absently, that he got it straight away this time.

"You'd explained all about how Sirius was framed by Peter, how he escaped from Azkaban, and you were just starting to tell us what happened when you were seven," said Cedric.

"The short version is that I went to live with Sirius and a few others in Greece. Albus Dumbledore is the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, so it's convenient for him to be near their base of operations. I was… homeschooled, I guess you could say, but kind of randomly, by whomever happened to be there. And for that to make sense, you have to know one important fact..." Harry set down his glass and looked at his friends directly. "Voldemort isn't dead."

To their credit, they didn't overreact. Cho gasped and Cedric flinched, but it was probably because of the spoken name. Harry's words likely hadn't settled in.

"It's not a secret," said Harry, forging ahead. "We want everyone to know, actually. It's just that no one would believe us. And it's not that he's alive, exactly, it's just that he's not dead. The proof we have is based on rumors Sirius and Remus picked up while tracking Peter, and on whatever the hell's going on with the Dark Mark. I don't quite understand that part, myself, but it's somehow tied to Voldemort's power, his influence, his presence. And it's coming into focus. Has been for a couple years. Dumbledore reckons he's not just a spirit anymore, that he's found some kind of middle ground. A possession, or some kind of temporary body like a homunculus that he'd have gotten with a Dark ritual involving a pregnant – "

"Stop," said Cho, her face ashen and her voice nearly a whisper.

Harry saw that Cedric's hands were nearly white around his silverware. "Sorry," he said softly.

"This is… a lot to take in," said Cedric.

Harry looked away. "I know," he said after a moment. "I probably shouldn't have said it all at once like that."

"It's okay," said Cho, her voice a bit stronger.

Cedric laughed, a hollow sound. "I wouldn't go that far."

"Take some time with it," urged Harry. "He's out there, but he's been out there for twelve years. You just didn't know. And there are good people, strong people working on it. I want to introduce you to Sirius if I can. He's dead clever. And between Albus and Nicolas, you've got two of the most brilliant minds in the magical world, even if they are a bit batty."

"Right," said Cedric uncertainly. He looked a little shell-shocked, which Harry felt was quite understandable. Cedric glanced over his shoulder. "Any other bombshells you want to drop on us before someone comes over? It looks like the vultures are circling."

"Not really," said Harry. He waited until Cedric had raised his glass to his lips and then said, "except for the fact that I'm a Parselmouth."

Predictably, Cedric started choking on his water. Cho was back to high-intensity glaring. "Say, Harry," she said ominously. "You know that line you're not supposed to cross when it comes to jokes in tense situations?"

"I'm coming up on it?" asked Harry.

"No, no. Look behind you."

Harry was saved from having to respond by a surly boy with thick black eyebrows and a rather distinctive large, curved nose, who sat down awkwardly next to Cho.

"Is vot they are saying true?" said the boy without preamble. "Does this boy outfly dragon?"

"By all means, have a seat, Viktor," said Cho, apparently still in a foul mood from Harry's joke. Cedric was still trying to clear his throat, but waved hello anyway. "These are my friends, Harry and Cedric. Guys, this is Viktor Krum."

"Nice to meet you," said Harry. "Cho says you're a fair hand on a broom."

"Yes," said Krum, waving his hand dismissively. "Now, tell me of dragon. I vould like details, please. Tell me of, I don't know vord – to escape danger."

"Close calls?" suggested Harry. Krum nodded eagerly. "There were a few. I'll need a new broom, for one thing. I'll miss it, but I'm glad to say it really died a hero. Not many brooms are set on fire via dragon's breath and then explode after crashing into a tree."

Krum scrunched up his face. "You are telling joke?"

Cedric cleared out the last of the water, then fixed Harry with a flat stare. "I think Harry's already hit his joke quota today."

Scowling, Krum turned to Cho. "Your friends are strange."

Cedric looked like he was going to reply, and then his eyes went wide. He was looking over Harry's shoulder, and if Harry didn't know better, he'd have thought Cedric was choking again.

"Bonjour, 'Arry," said a familiar voice.

Harry glanced over his shoulder. "Hey, Fleur. So, what's the good word? Are we getting kicked out of Quidditch Camp, or what?"

She shrugged artlessly and slid gracefully into the seat beside Harry.

Cedric cleared his throat loudly. "Harry. You never said the girl you had your little adventure with was… uh…"

Harry looked at him quizzically. "Was what?"

Cho narrowed her eyes. "Yeah, Cedric. Was what?"

"Er…" Cedric looked around the table for help. Harry was baffled. He'd never seen Cedric, who was usually the most collected one in the room, thrown for words like this. "…French," said Cedric.

"Oh, I guess I never mentioned that," said Harry. "I don't suppose any of you speak French?"

Cho shook her head, and Cedric did as well after Cho nudged him, hard, with her elbow.

"I haff enough trouble vith English," grumbled Krum.

"Hmm," said Harry. "Well, how are you with hand gestures?"



* * *



The alarm went off and Harry rolled out of bed and immediately stumbled to the wardrobe, barely awake. It was almost reflex now, and though it was tempting to simply fall asleep on top of a pile of coats in the wardrobe, it was worth it simply because it meant not spending a single waking second longer than he had to at the Dursleys. It was the principle of the thing, really. In practice… well, he'd only fallen asleep a few times inside the wardrobe.

He blinked at the all-encompassing sunlight at the other end of the wardrobe. His room at the Flamels' house opened onto a deck that looked out over a glorious, sparkling white sand beach, the ocean beyond a fantastically alluring blue-green that made for great postcards – though, at the moment, Harry was in the mood to appreciate precisely none of it.

The two men waiting for him on the deck were a study in contrasts. Remus Lupin looked as haggard as Harry did, though for a different reason – Harry, because he hated mornings and mornings hated him, and Remus because the full moon was approaching. The second man looked annoyingly cheerful, considering the hour.

"Ah, good morning, Harry!" said Dumbledore. He was reclining on a deck chair, his usual half-moon spectacles swapped out for a pair of cheap plastic sunglasses. He pushed down the edge of a copy of Transfiguration Today he was holding up and regarded Harry with what passed for a somber expression. "I trust you slept well?"

"It would have been better with another four hours, but I'll make do," said Harry. "Let's just get this over with."

"Are you sure, Harry?" asked Remus with a touch of anxiety. "You look a bit peaky."

"I'm sure. It's better if I'm off my game, remember? That's why I'm up at this ungodly hour."

"You remind me of James so much sometimes," said Remus, a wistful smile coming over his face. "On the weekends, he used to charm the curtains on his bed to mummify anyone who tried to open them before noon."

"Sounds like a smashing idea," said Harry, leaning against the deck railing and rubbing his eyes.

Dumbledore arose from the deck chair and removed his sunglasses, replacing them with his spectacles. He held his wand loosely at his side.

Harry took a deep breath and looked him in the eye.

"Do you know a man named Remus Lupin, Harry?" asked Dumbledore.

"Never heard of him," said Harry. "Strange name, though. Who is he?"

Dumbledore held his glance for a long moment. For Harry, it seemed to stretch out to full minutes. Defending against passive Legilimency took a tricky kind of focused detachment that Harry still hadn't quite mastered. He was getting better, though. There wasn't anything to fight against – rather, it was the magical equivalent of someone blurting, "don't think of a pink elephant!" and shrugging and saying, "fine, I won't." Harry simply let the words Remus Lupin bounce around his head without hitting anything that would trigger an emotional response.

"Excellent," murmured Dumbledore at last. "I believe you will have no trouble with direct questions, such as those the Ministry might ask of you. You must be on your guard, however. A clever questioner will find opportunities to upset your balance."

"Noted. And now the real test. Come on, then," said Harry, trying to keep himself relaxed.

Dumbledore seemed to be weighing him, his gaze penetrating.

"It's now or never, right?" said Harry impatiently. "I go back to Hogwarts tomorrow. I need to know if I can do this."

"Very well," said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and pointed it at Harry. "Legilimens," he said, almost gently.

The experience wasn't pleasant. Compared to Proudfoot, Dumbledore had an elegant, subtle touch, but it still hit Harry like a punch to the gut. Even so, Harry preferred it – this was something he could fight. He held his mind in a kind of frozen, crystalline void. He felt nothing, he was nothing. And yet in his nothingness, he was not without power. He was the abyss, and Dumbledore had been gazing for too long.

He slammed back against Dumbledore's intrusion with a hammer of dark indifference.

This was something Harry could do, something he could fight. A real master, a perfect Occlumens, could let the attacker inside and show them a carefully prepared lie so convincing that it seemed real. It was a subtle, powerfully difficult technique that Snape assured Harry he could spend ten years practicing and never achieve. Harry didn't know if he believed him, and someday he meant to find out, but in the meantime, it was more viscerally satisfying anyway to hit back.

Dumbledore jerked his arm back, his wand dropping, and he swayed on his feet for a moment. "Very good, Harry," he said, grimacing. "You have made remarkable progress this summer. I daresay your experience integrating your true memories and discarding your false ones was excellent preparation for Occlumency."

"Funny how that worked out," said Harry flatly.

"A good plan always dovetails nicely into the next one," said Dumbledore cheerfully. "In any case, you are as secure as you can reasonably be from direct Legilimency attacks. If, by chance, the Ministry employs such direct tactics again, you will be quite able to defend yourself. Although your rather… strident… defense may raise some eyebrows, Occlumency is not illegal. I would recommend you employ this defense sparingly, however."

"Works for me," said Harry, rubbing his temples. "It takes a lot out of me."

"Indeed," said Dumbledore. He looked out over the ocean, his expression distant. "Those who regularly employ Occlumency do so at their own peril. Though it may be an effective means of keeping one's secrets, the long-term costs of such rigid control and suppression of memories and emotions can be quite high. Beware, Harry, of the terrible price we can pay for our control, for our secrets. Often, the cost is a hidden one, not easily seen until it is far too late to rectify."

Harry almost snapped at Dumbledore, then. He'd heard the same lecture before, in different words. It seemed to be how the man operated – repetition, patience, and a flair for the dramatic speech now and again. Something stopped him from voicing his annoyance, though. Something about Dumbledore's expression as he looked out over the water made Harry hold his tongue.

"Ah, it seems the second part of the day's activities is ready to commence!" said Dumbledore, his expression brightening considerably as two figures Apparated onto the beach near the shoreline.

Harry walked down the steps to the beach, holding out a hand and waving. One of the men returned his wave, the other studiously ignored it.

"Sirius! Didn't expect to see you until later today. What're you doing with Snape, anyway?"

Remus and Dumbledore had joined Harry on the beach, and Dumbledore seemed to be busy drawing a line in the sand. Remus waved his wand and conjured a bench behind it.

"I've been recruited as part of a little demonstration, apparently," said Sirius. He was wearing his long, dark hair pulled back with some kind of clasp, which was odd, as he usually wore it loose and fussed with it often. He was wearing his customary pair of jeans and faded, half-buttoned shirt, but today he had an accessory: a black leather belt with a wand holster hung low and slightly crooked on his waist.

Harry gave it a questioning look, and Sirius grinned. "Old-fashioned, I know. Used to be the Auror standard back when James and I were considering the Academy. Fell out of fashion about a decade ago; most duelists go for those fancy wrist holsters nowadays. They're subtler, for sure, but I've seen them get tangled up in sleeves before, and nothing's quicker on the draw than one of these babies."

Sirius put action to words and flicked his wand into his hand. Harry had a strange mental image of Sirius as an old-West gunslinger.

"So what's this all about?" asked Harry.

"My idea," said Remus, coming up beside him. "I thought this would be a good way to send you off. I've been trying to think of a way to get my point across, something I've been trying to teach you for a long time. You know how you keep asking to learn dueling, how you keep wanting to learn advanced curses, tactics, stances, stuff like that?"

"I want to know how to fight, yes," said Harry cautiously. It was an old argument, one that he'd never really won.

"Yes," said Remus, a bit sadly. "And no one is thrilled by that, given your age. But we understand it. These aren't typical circumstances. However… what I've been trying to tell you, Harry, is that teaching you those things would be a bad idea. Not because you're too young to learn them, but because it would be too limiting."

"I still don't understand," said Harry.

"I know," said Remus. "And that's the idea I had. I've told you every way I know how. But I think it will be better to show you."

Remus gestured towards the bench, where Dumbledore was already sitting. He'd summoned his magazine and was humming to himself and reading. Harry sat in the middle, and Remus sat beside him.

Harry watched as Sirius and Snape walked a short distance away from each other. They stood apart, facing each other, unmoving for a time. Snape looked cool and impassive, whereas Sirius had an almost expectant, dangerous grin on his face.

They bowed. Slightly. Harry thought Sirius's two-fingered salute at the end probably wasn't traditional.

And then they were in motion. Snape drew his wand smoothly from his robes, dropping to a knee in the same action. Sirius had drawn from his holster impossibly fast, a jet of angry orange light passing over Snape's left shoulder.

Snape flicked his wand and shot dark red spells, one after the other, at Sirius. They were aimed low, and Sirius jumped out of the way. The spells left a hissing, burning spot on the sand where they connected. Instead of pressing his advantage, Snape swept his wand in a tight circle, conjuring a rough-hewn block of stone that he ducked behind. He seemed to be predicting Sirius's movements as Sirius's counterstrike, a powerful-looking blast of white light, only made the stone block shudder slightly.

"What does it remind you of?" asked Remus.

Harry watched, entranced, as they traded spells. He'd never seen them duel like this. They weren't trying to kill each other, obviously, but it looked a near thing. The spells Harry recognized weren't exactly Stunners. He flinched back as a sickly yellow spell shot towards the bench, deflected by Sirius with a quick bit of wand-work. The spell impacted a shield that shimmered briefly before fading back into invisibility – a shield that sprang into being directly above the line Dumbledore had drawn in the sand.

"A gunfight," said Harry. And it was true. The quick, staccato blasts of light. The way they used cover. The ebb and flow of the battle, like an exchange of shots.

Sirius charged. Roaring, he fired spell after spell at Snape, who was forced back. The tempo of the duel increased. The slashing, angry wand gestures. The way the lights of the spells were deflected, crackling against each other as the range decreased. The footwork, how Snape danced away from Sirius's aggressive strikes, turning them back, how Sirius charged ahead, each step pressing the other man.

"Or a swordfight," said Harry.

"Yes," said Remus. "That's what dueling looks like. That's what most real fighting looks like, too. When a pair of Aurors pin down a criminal and it becomes a pitched firefight, it usually looks something like this."

Snape had turned the tide; Sirius's aggression had cost him. Snape sent a spell that was almost black right at the other man's head, and Sirius was forced to cast a thick, heavy Shield Charm. Even so, the impact sent him staggering back, and Snape pressed his advantage.

Sirius dove to his right, snapping off a Bludgeoning Hex at just the right moment. Snape, who was mid-cast, could only twist to avoid it and it struck him in the ankle. He snarled, going to one knee, and slashed the air with his wand. Sirius, prone on the ground, rolled away and cried out as the spell tore through his shirt, his shoulder jerking with a crack that Harry could hear from fifty feet away.

"That's enough!" called Remus, standing up. Sirius and Snape both got to their feet, their expressions unreadable. "I didn't mean for you two to get vicious, but I suppose it was an effective demonstration." He turned to Harry. "So, what did you think? Did that meet your expectations? Is that what you want to learn how to do?"

"Well, yeah," said Harry, sensing he was walking into a trap but not able to see it.

"Don't be so sure," said Remus with a faint trace of smugness. He coughed. Then again, louder. He looked over Harry's head in irritation. "Albus, the whole 'inscrutable wisdom' routine works a lot better when you pick up on the signals."

"Ah, forgive me, Remus," said Dumbledore, folding his magazine neatly on the bench. "I was just reading the most fascinating article about the sixteen tertiary exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration…" he looked up. "Perhaps another time."

Dumbledore stood and up and walked down the beach, stepping with care over the line he'd drawn. Sirius and Snape now stood loosely together, eying each other warily.

"Gentlemen," said Dumbledore, bowing smoothly. Sirius and Snape exchanged a hooded glance, then faced Dumbledore and bowed back.

Harry leaned forward in anticipation.

They were quick, very quick. Sirius's silver spell was aimed high and left, at Dumbledore's shoulder, and Snape's violet jet of light was aimed low and right. Harry filed it away for future reference, something to tease his godfather about at a later date – for all ways in which the two of them couldn't stand each other, apparently Sirius and Snape made a decent team.

As the spells converged on him, Dumbledore flicked his wand almost casually, and the sand sprung up in front of him. The creature was shaped like a lion, or a bear – something large and with four legs, anyway. The sand-creature leaped forward, its paws absorbing the spells as it threw itself, bodily, at the two duelists.

Sirius tried diving out of the way, whereas Snape took a more direct approach, conjuring a blast of wind and directing it towards the oncoming sand lion. The creature burst apart, but the cloud of sand seemed to have a mind of its own, swirling angrily into a miniature tornado. Snape tried desperately to hold it off, fighting a losing battle as he directed wind against a storm of sand. Sirius, meanwhile, was taking advantage of the cover to take potshots at Dumbledore, who hadn't moved yet.

Dumbledore casually stepped out of the way of one curse, sweeping his wand even as he moved and leaving a trail of fire in his wake, living, twisting flame that seemed to crystallize in place. Sirius's second spell hit the shield of flame, which pulsed with dark, angry light for a second, and then expelled the curse back the way it came, but faster, and – judging from the way it made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand up as it passed – with much more power.

Sirius and Snape took cover behind a hastily conjured wall of steel as the spell literally exploded in front of them, sending them clattering to the sand in a messy heap.

Dumbledore flicked his wand again.

Sirius and Snape were back on their feet, hastily exchanging a few words, no doubt planning another attack, when the wave took them. One of the gentle, foot-high waves that had been lapping peacefully at the shore all morning spouted up to a ten-foot monstrosity with a frothing, scary-looking crest and rushed up the beach, crashing over the beleaguered duelists. Instead of washing away, the water remained, trapping them. Dumbledore took careful aim and waved his wand in a complicated motion. The water started collapsing in on itself, twisting, turning, contorting itself into thin lines.

A few seconds later, Sirius and Snape were trussed up in ropes of living water, breathing hard and completely immobilized.

The whole thing had taken less than thirty seconds, and Harry was pretty sure that had been for his benefit, that if Dumbledore had wanted to, he could have done it in three seconds. It was on another level altogether. Every move, calculated. Every defense, an attack at the same time. Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.

"You see," said Remus, "you'll never learn to do that if you set out by learning how to fight. Aurors are specialists. You narrow your focus that much, and you eventually start limiting yourself in some pretty serious ways. Be a generalist, Harry. Dumbledore's a generalist. If you only learn about magic that helps you fight, you'll get good at it, no question. And faster, too. With the head start that you've got, if you start learning to duel, you could probably take any student at Hogwarts by the end of the year."

Harry watched as Dumbledore dispelled the water-ropes, going over to the downed combatants, exchanging words with them, joking, laughing. He didn't look at all intimidating.

"But," continued Remus, "if you learn about everything, if you cast a wide net, if you embrace magic as a whole, if you leave no stone unturned… things will be slow. By the end of the year, you might not even be noticeably stronger at all. But there will come a time when something will click. You'll understand something, see some kind of order in the chaos, some fundamental truth. It clicked for Dumbledore when he was a third year. It clicked for your mother when she was out of Hogwarts and engaged to James. And I firmly believe that if she were alive right now, she'd give Dumbledore a run for his money."

Remus stood, and rested a hand on Harry's shoulder for a moment. "Be a generalist, Harry. It's the harder road, the longer road, but you have it in you. I've seen it. You put in the time, you make an honest effort, and you'll be an absolute nightmare on the battlefield. Trust me."

And he walked away, going to join the others on the beach.

Harry sat there for a long while, his head propped up by his arms, thinking.



* * *



September 1st was chilly that year. Harry stood in the square outside King's Cross. The morning hustle and bustle was in full swing, and Harry, Remus, and Sirius were ensconced at the edge of the crowd, Remus's subtle Muggle-Repelling Charm ensuring them a pocket of space. Remus wore his own face, but Sirius had taken Polyjuice and looked like a nondescript man in his fifties – even a dozen years later, any whiff of Sirius Black popping up in London would be a front-page panic.

"Got everything, Harry?" asked Sirius. "All set?"

Harry glanced at his feet, where Hedwig's cage sat atop his school trunk. He patted his coat and felt for the hidden inner pocket in the lining, which had been enhanced with an Undetectable Extension Charm. "All set. No, wait, actually, I forgot something."

Remus frowned. "We can't exactly head back now; the train leaves in fifteen minutes."

"No, I mean I forgot to do something." He fished around his hidden pocket, careful not to let his hand slip too far into his coat. He came up with a letter, slightly creased. "I got this a couple days ago. It's from someone I met at Quidditch Camp. The problem is, it's in French. I was hoping you could get Perenelle to translate it for me?"

"A friend, huh?" said Sirius. "This would be the girl who recklessly led you on a race through a dragon sanctuary?"

"I don't know why you guys are so hung up on that. I think it's a brilliant story. And it's not like it was that big a deal. We didn't even get suspended or banned or anything."

"Well, I almost suspended you," growled Sirius. "I nearly came down and pulled you out when I heard about it."

"But you didn't," said Harry. He opened the envelope and separated the letter from the picture Fleur had paper-clipped to it.

"Hang on, what's that?" asked Remus.

"Just a picture," said Harry. "I'm guessing Fleur wanted to show me what her house looked like? I don't know. I've never actually talked to her. That's what I'm hoping Perenelle can help me with. I want to send a photo back, at least. I didn't want to send a picture of the Dursleys, and I can't very well send her a picture of the island, so I thought I'd wait until I get to Hogwarts and send her a picture of that."

Remus held out his hand for the photo, and Harry passed it to him. Remus blinked, holding it closer. "Well. I wasn't expecting… that is, when you picture the type of girl who attends Quidditch camp, you naturally think of someone a bit more, ah… what I mean to say is…"

Sirius snatched the photo out of Remus's grasp. He looked at it and let out a long whistle. "That is one good-looking teenager," he said bluntly.

Arching an eyebrow was Remus's only response, but that one look spoke volumes.

"What?" said Sirius after a moment, glancing up and seeing Remus's look.

"How old do you think she is?" asked Remus casually.

"I don't know, fourteen?"

Remus started inspecting his fingernails. "And how old do you think you are, Padfoot?"

Sirius glanced down at the picture again. "Oh, goddamn it."

Harry snatched the picture back, stuffed it in his pocket, and passed the letter to Remus. "What is wrong with the two of you?"

"We don't have that kind of time," said Sirius.

Remus smiled faintly as he glanced at his watch. "Agreed. Now, Harry, you're clear on your role this year? We know Voldemort is interested in Hogwarts, and we know he's very interested in you. Without a real body, that means he'll work through proxies. We'll all be working hard back home to find him and stop him, but if he does have someone there, and you catch on, it's not your job to confront him, it's not your job to figure out what he's planning, and it's certainly not your job to thwart him. It's your job to alert us."

"I remember the plan," said Harry. He shrugged. "Sounds good on paper."

Sirius and Remus glanced at each other, and Sirius rubbed the bridge of his nose, scowling.

"All right, then," said Remus. He knelt down next to Harry's trunk, setting Hedwig's cage aside, and drew a key ring with several glittering golden keys from his pocket. "Sirius and I have a couple last-minute gifts for you." He flicked through the keys, chose one, and unlocked Harry's trunk with it. "I guess the first one is that we made a couple modifications to your trunk."

Harry blinked. Instead of his robes, quills, parchment, and books, the only thing in the trunk was a broom. It was resting in a finely-crafted wooden cradle, taking up the entire compartment.

The broom almost glowed. It was beautiful, sleek, and very fast looking. The words Nimbus 2000 were etched along the handle in golden letters.

"Just came out last month," said Remus quietly as Harry took it in. "Top of the line model."

"I'm trying very hard to forget why you need a new one, but since you do, might as well be a good one," said Sirius.

Harry ran his hand over the handle. He turned and gave Remus a tight hug. "Thanks. This is… just, thanks."

Sirius stepped forward, closed the trunk lid, and then started fiddling with the keychain. "So this last gift isn't really a gift… I mean, it is, but it's more like an inheritance. You've already got your dad's Cloak – keep it in your pocket at all times, remember – but this belonged to him to, and even if it's not as useful, I thought you'd still – ah, there we go."

The trunk opened with a click, and Harry peered inside. It was looked empty, but Sirius fished around and came up with something. It was a belt and wand holster of the same style Sirius had worn for the dueling demonstration, except this one was a mellow, faded brown leather instead of black.

"James wore this all the time," said Sirius in a quiet voice as he handed it to Harry. "He'd want you to have it."

Harry couldn't speak. He ran his hands over the length of the belt and found himself staring at one of the notches. The hole was worn, rough around the edges. That was the one my dad used, thought Harry. That's where it fit him.

He thought about putting it on right then and there, but it was a little too much. He felt his throat tighten as he set the belt down in his trunk reverently, as though it were delicate gossamer. "I'll try it on later," he said in a rough, shaky voice.

Sirius didn't say anything, he just hugged Harry.

"Have a good year," said Remus. "You can contact us any time. You've got ways to do it now. We're with you."

"Right," said Harry, pretty much reduced to one syllable at a time.

"I'll walk you to the barrier," said Sirius.

Remus gave him another pat on the shoulder, and then Harry started moving through the crowd, his godfather at his side, his trunk and his owl behind him. It was the work of a few minutes to make their way through King's Cross. As they neared Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, Sirius stopped, moving off behind a ticket counter and gesturing for Harry to follow. He cast a quick Muffliato.

"I'm on your side," said Sirius abruptly.

"I know that," said Harry, still a bit off-balance.

"I mean it," said Sirius. "I know it's not easy, keeping all these secrets. You have to pick who to trust, and things will inevitably get murky and complicated, and it'll be messy. I know you. You're going to keep some things entirely to yourself."

Harry tried not to react, thinking immediately of his mother's journal, safely hidden in the secret pocket in his coat.

"And that's okay," continued Sirius. "You should have your own secrets, too. But I just want you to know that I'm always on your side." Sirius took a deep breath and looked at him steadily. "Voldemort wants to kill you. The Ministry will want to prop you up as a hero or tear you down as a villain, whatever serves their public image and the status quo best. Dumbledore wants to beat Voldemort, and he sees you as a part of that. He's a powerful wizard and a kind man, but I've fought on his side and I've seen him sacrifice ten to save fifty. The vast majority of the public will want you to solve all their Dark Lord problems while they find reasons to complain about you and put you up on a pedestal at the same time."

Sirius looked away, and Harry saw a tear form in his eye that Sirius quickly blinked away. He looked very fierce in that moment. "But me… I'm just in your corner. I don't give a shit what happens to the world. I just want things to go well for you. Your parents – my best friend – got monumentally screwed, and I see it as my job to force the universe to repay that debt."

Harry nodded, not trusting himself to speak. He gathered up his trunk and Hedwig's cage.

Sirius clapped him on the shoulder, nodded back, turned, and started walking away.

Harry shouldered his way through the crowd and slipped through the barrier. The platform was even busier than he remembered; people were moving very quickly. The blue-and-bronze Hogwarts Express blew a shrill whistle, and the shouted goodbyes and frantic, last-minute missives were rushed even further.

There was Cho, leaning out from a compartment near the end of the train. She caught Harry's eye and grinned madly, pointing to the train's color. She yelped as Cedric pulled her back inside. There was Katie Bell, struggling to heft her trunk into the train. Fred and George Weasley were suddenly there, sweeping it from her arms, bowing extravagantly, and whatever they said made Katie blush furiously and take a swing at them. There was Mike Vaisey exchanging words with the Slytherin Quidditch Captain, Marcus Flint, the two of them in some kind of heated debate that was so intense they didn't even seem to realize the train was about to leave. There were new faces Harry didn't recognize: brand-new first years all wearing a similar look of eager, frightened expectation.

Harry squared his shoulders. He patted the breast of his coat. Inside his secret pocket, among other things, he had his father's Cloak of Invisibility, his mother's journal, and one of Sirius's two-way mirrors. Inside his head he had his true memories, more than four years of knowledge, techniques, theories, and experiences.

Harry felt a warm, blazing feeling, like he was ready to conquer the world. "Okay. Year two. Here we go."

6. Chapter 6

Author's Note: The holidays messed with my schedule a bit, thus, the wait for this chapter. My goal for this fic is to produce a chapter every ~2 weeks, and have that chapter be roughly 10,000 words, which is a decent length to sink into. That's a fairly quick pace of writing, so I may not always hit that goal. I appreciate the continued support, very much.

Chapter 5 – Seekers and Sought

Harry's good mood lasted approximately five minutes.

After shoving through the crowded corridor of the train, after hurried greetings to casual acquaintances, after dragging his things into Cho and Cedric's compartment, after nearly falling over as the train jerked into motion just as Harry was securing his trunk on the luggage rack – after all of it, the only thing he wanted to do was sit in the corner and rest his head against the window.

It wasn't to be. A minute after the train started moving, Cho's friend Marietta stuck her head into the compartment.

"Cho!" Her happy, squealing voice was the aural equivalent of a low-grade sunburn: just annoying enough that it was impossible to ignore. "Did you have a good summer?"

"I did, thanks!" replied Cho. "We had a grand time at Quidditch Camp."

"I heard," said Marietta, singularly focused on Cho. "Did Harry really fight a dragon? It's all over the train."

"Harry's sitting right here, thanks," said Harry.

"Oh, right. Hi, Harry. And Cedric." Marietta half-glanced at Cedric and blushed. "Good to see you both."

"Hmm?" Cedric had a somewhat baffled grin on his face as he eyed the pair of giggling fourth-year girls currently walking past the compartment.

Cho reached over and smacked him with a practiced motion. "You're not going to be like this all the time now that you're thirteen, right?"

"Huh?" Cedric tore his gaze away from the fourth-years and gave Cho a puzzled frown.

"Does being a teenager reduce you to monosyllables?" asked Harry. "If so, I don't think it's for me."

"I feel very ganged-up on right now," said Cedric. He reached under his seat and pulled out a thick textbook. "I think the best thing for me to do would be to go over this material for Ancient Runes."

"Oh, that's right, you're taking electives this year," gushed Marietta. "What else are you taking?"

"Arithmancy, of course," said Cedric. "It's dead useful. And Care of Magical Creatures – Potions is my best class, and there's some crossover potential. You know, harvesting your own ingredients and stuff."

"Lots of new things this year, then," said Marietta. "New classes, and you'll be able to visit Hogsmeade. Maybe you could pick up some things for me at Honeydukes?

She batted her eyelashes. Harry was floored. Girls actually do that?

"I'm sure Cedric can pick up stuff for you too, Cho, and for Harry as well," she continued blithely. "It'll be a bit odd, though, won't it? The three of you are usually thick as thieves, and Cedric's going to be doing all these new things without you." Her eyes widened. "Oh! And what happens if all three of you actually make it onto Quidditch teams? You'll have to play against each other all the time. I imagine that would be horribly stressful."

Either ignoring or completely missing the tension in the air, Marietta got to her feet. "Well, I should get back to my compartment. Cho, you should stop by. I'm sure the girls would love to see you. You know, if you get the chance." With a final, quick smile at Cedric, she left.

The silence in the compartment stretched to an uncomfortable number of seconds.

"Well," said Harry, "that was subtle."

"I know," said Cho, scowling. "She wasn't happy about the whole Quidditch Camp thing. She thinks I'm abandoning all my Ravenclaw friends or something."

"I meant the other thing, actually."

"Yeah, what was that all about?" asked Cedric. "She was looking at me weird."

Harry and Cho glanced at each other.

Harry drew his wand, pointed it at his own head, and cast a Deafness Hex. "All yours, Cho," he said, too loudly, unable to hear his own voice.

He busied himself letting Hedwig out of her cage, bending and very consciously not looking up for a solid thirty seconds. When he did come up – Hedwig immediately flying to Cho's shoulder – he applied the counter-curse. Cho and Cedric had evidently finished their conversation, and both were blushing faintly.

"Just so we're clear, I'm opting out of all those kinds of conversations for at least another year," said Harry. "Possibly forever."

Cedric shot him a dubious grin, and Cho bit her lip. "I don't know if that's realistic, Harry," she said. "You're famous and everything, and if for no other reason than that, you're going to have to deal with girls eventually."

"You could keep doing what you're doing and wear thick glasses and ratty clothes, though," said Cedric. "That'll keep 'em off your back for a while."

"Thanks so much," said Harry. "I've always wanted to be known for my completely unfounded fame and my terrible fashion sense, so that's good."

Cho shrugged, the motion jostling Hedwig. "You do wear awful clothes, Harry. Though I can't see why. You bought those brooms last year, so I can't imagine it being a big deal to have a few other nice things."

"These are my cousin's hand-me-downs," said Harry, glancing at his faded, torn jeans and too-large grey t-shirt. "It might be suspicious if my ridiculously mean family gave me nice clothes. And besides, what could it possibly matter? They're clothes – who gives a damn?"

Cedric fingered the collar of his neatly pressed button-down nervously, and Cho crossed her legs under her fashionable skirt.

"Give it time, Harry," said Cho, her lips quirking into an insufferably knowing smirk. "I bet this time next year you'll be singing a different tune."

"I'll take that bet," said Harry promptly. "Five Galleons?"

Cho hesitated, and Cedric nudged her. "Go for it," he said. "You can't fight hormones."

"Fine," snapped Cho. "You're on." She stretched out her hand – once against shifting Hedwig, who hooted in protest – and Harry shook it.

"Money for nothing," said Harry, grinning. "This is just too easy."

"I'm going to laugh at you so much next year when you show up in designer jeans," said Cho.

"Yeah, yeah," said Harry, waving his hand dismissively. "Just keep those Galleons handy." He leaned back, putting his hands behind his head. "You know, even if Marietta was being a bit rude about it, she's not wrong. Especially considering my, you know, memory thing. I have all this new information in my head… like, did you know I'm kind of terrified of deep water?"

Cedric raised an eyebrow. "Since when? You never mentioned anything like that."

"I know," said Harry. "I couldn't remember. But when I was nine, I swam out – "

The compartment door slid open and three redheads entered. Fred and George Weasley had a third boy – gangly, freckled, a bit shorter – sandwiched between them with two arms over his shoulder, the camaraderie spoiled by the younger boy's petulant frown as he was dragged along.

"Ah, there you are," said George. "Tales of your Quidditch Camp exploits seem to be the popular topic on the train, Harry."

"Exaggerated, I'm sure," said Harry. "Only my broom got scorched by the dragon, nothing else."

"Dragon?" said Fred. "We were talking about some blindingly hot French girl you apparently made friends with."

Harry shot Cho an irritated glare. "What, did you run up and down the train with a bell like a town crier?"

"Anyway, we're just making the rounds," said George. "As you can see, Eustis had a run-in with a bad batch of Aging Potion, and it's made him all tetchy and gangly. Calls himself 'Ron' now, the poor deluded fellow."

"Hi," said Ron shortly. "You seem to know Fred and George pretty well, so I don't need to apologize for them, right?"

"Nah, we're used to it," said Cedric.

"Nice to meet you," said Cho.

"Hey, hang on, you look like – " Ron was looking at Harry, but Fred and George dragged him away, waving goodbye, no doubt moving on to other, more embarrassing introductions for their younger brother.

"Anyway," said Cedric, turning to Harry. "What were you saying about being afraid of water?"

"Deep water," said Harry. "Not all water. That would be a problem. And really, it's not deep water so much as water you can't see the bottom of. It's like, what's down there? I don't know. Could be anything. Could be rocket sharks."

"What exactly are – "

"Doesn't matter. The point is, when I was nine, I was messing around on the beach of the Flamels' island, and I swam – "

The compartment door slid open, and Mike Vaisey stuck his head in. "Potter," he said without preamble, "I wanted to ask you a favor."

Harry sighed. "I'm not going to be target practice for Bludgers, Vaisey, not again. It was fun the first time, but it got old pretty fast."

"Please?" wheedled Vaisey. "I need to shake off the rust. Slytherin holds tryouts right away. I think it's because Muggle-borns can't stay sharp over the summer and everyone else can."

"That's pretty low," said Cedric.

"That's Slytherin," said Vaisey, shrugging. "Squeeze out every little advantage you can."

"We'll all help you, Mike," said Cho. "Tomorrow morning before breakfast." Harry and Cedric groaned, and Cho rounded on them. "Well, I for one wouldn't mind having someone on the Slytherin team who wasn't a complete troll. Did you see the Chaser line Flint rolled out last year? They could barely fit through the hoops, much less hit them."

Vaisey narrowed his eyes. "It's not like I'm going to go easy on you, assuming we all make it."

"Of course not," said Cho sweetly. "I just like my opponents to be smart enough that they can understand how thoroughly they're beaten."

"Wow, Chang," said Vaisey with a low whistle, "what exactly did you guys study at that Quidditch Camp?"

"Cho was scary long before this summer," said Cedric.

"Right," said Vaisey. "Anyway, thanks. I really appreciate it. Tomorrow morning, then? Early?"

Harry groaned. "I was just starting to warm up to you, Vaisey. Now, not so much. If this turns out to be some convoluted Slytherin scheme to turn me evil via sleep deprivation, I'm putting doxy eggs in your pumpkin juice."

"You're talking about someone who likes Marmite, Harry," said Cedric. "I doubt he'd even notice."

"Yeah, yeah," said Vaisey, stepping out into the hallway. "See you tomorrow. Thanks!" He slid the door shut.

Harry paused for a long beat, looking at the door, then sank back into the seat. "Finally. Now where was I? I swear, the next person who interrupts my story is getting hexed."

The door slid open, the sound of it rattling along the track covering Harry's muttered expletive. A girl stuck her head into the compartment, then walked in, bold as brass.

"Excuse me, have you seen a toad? Neville's lost one." The girl, who was already wearing her Hogwarts robes, had an assertive sort of voice, brown hair, and rather prominent front teeth. "We've been up and down the carriage, and no one seems to be able to help, including the prefects, which I think is rather sloppy for prefects, don't you? Is that a messenger owl?" She pointed at Hedwig, who was snoozing on Cho's shoulder. "I wanted to get an owl, but my parents were a bit nervous about it. Nobody in my family's magic at all, you see. Did you know you're not supposed to have pets out of their cages on the train? I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?"

She said it all very fast, and in one breath.

"Cedric. Cedric Diggory," said a slightly stunned Cedric.

Hermione beamed at him, then glanced at Harry. "Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."

Harry had been staring at the girl, twirling his wand idly in his fingers as she talked, the tip slowing down on each revolution as it pointed at her.

Cedric glanced Harry's way, and in a flash, was politely pushing Hermione out of the compartment. "No one's seen a toad, nice to meet you, thanks, bye!"

"What?" said Harry, "I was going to show her some magic."

"That," said Cedric, "is what I was afraid of."

Cho started laughing helplessly. "That girl is so going to be in Ravenclaw."

"Okay, this time, I'm really serious," said Harry. "Let's lock the door or something. It's not even that good a story. I'd just like to get the whole thing out without – "

The compartment door slid open.

The boy who walked in had his hair slicked back, and it was so blond it was radioactive. He was flanked by two others: large, broad-shouldered boys, both of whom had bowl cuts and similar looks of grimacing menace.

"Harry Potter, right?" said the blond boy. His voice had the timbre of a bored aristocrat, albeit a prepubescent one. "Someone said I could find you here. I thought you'd look a bit more impressive. Why are you dressed like some kind of peasant?"

Harry blinked. "Do you always introduce yourself like that? You must not have very many friends."

The blond boy puffed out his chest. "Please. Friends come to me. I wouldn't even be here now except that my father says I'm supposed to take you under my wing, though I can't see why. You seem to have already thrown in with half-bloods and blood-traitors, and you're a Gryffindor besides. I suppose I can set you straight, though. Come along, and I'll introduce you to some of the right sort of people."

Cedric had a fishlike expression on his face, and Cho was looking at the boy like he was something nasty she'd scraped off her boots.

Harry was almost lost for words, but not quite. "Are you for real?" he managed.

The boy's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Do you know who I am?" he said, in what would have been a cold, steely voice except for the fact that it was coming out of an eleven-year old.

"Right, that's it," said Harry. He sprang to his feet, shoving the blond boy out of the compartment. Harry moved to close the door, but one of the boy's thuggish companions stuck out his foot, blocking it. Harry scowled and pulled his wand. The blonde boy opened his mouth to say something, and Harry swung his wand forward in a whipping motion, sending out a bright streak of light that whistled and exploded with a bang on the door to the next carriage.

Harry's voice carried to the entire carriage, and, their attention grabbed by the light and sound, a multitude of doors opened and curious students peeked their heads out to watch.

"ATTENTION, HOGWARTS EXPRESS." Harry's voice was a stentorian bellow. "WE HAVE A CHILD IN CARRIAGE FOUR WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. IF ANYONE KNOWS A SMALL, PALE BOY WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN DIPPED HEADFIRST INTO A VAT OF HAIR GEL, PLEASE COME COLLECT HIM NOW."

The blond boy flushed, opened his mouth to say something, was completely drowned out by Harry's voice, and then spun in a huff and left, his henchmen in tow. Harry's voice followed them down the corridor and chased them out of the carriage.

"ADDITIONALLY, IF ANYONE HAS ANY BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP CAPTAIN PEROXIDE HERE SORT OUT HIS IDENTITY ISSUES, PLEASE CONTACT ST. MUNGO'S SPELL DAMAGE WARD IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME."

Harry stepped back into the compartment, sat down, and closed his eyes. He leaned back in his seat, smiling the contented smile of a job well done.

Cho peeked out from behind her hands. "Is it over?"

"That," said Cedric cautiously, "was not very nice. I mean sure, that kid was pretty rude, but did he really deserve that?"

"You're barking," said Harry. "If anything, I looked like the crazy one in that exchange. Whoever that was gets to go back to his little circle of friends with a funny, interesting story. Stories like that are like currency around here. If you really want to be picky about it, I helped him."

Cedric pursed his lips and stared at Harry. "Do you actually believe that garbage that just came out of your mouth?"

Harry shrugged, wobbling his hand in a side-to-side motion.

"Well, if you're going to tell us the story after all that, it had better be worth it," said Cho.

It wasn't.



* * *



Even in mid-September, Harry needed a warm jacket to sit in the Quidditch stands for any length of time. He rubbed the back of his neck as the Ravenclaw Chaser hopefuls ran through an interminable passing drill; it felt like he'd been sitting there for hours.

Mike Vaisey sat to his right. The second-year Slytherin was still flush with victory; he was a starting Beater for his House team, and apparently that was all he wanted out of life. He was either there at the Ravenclaw tryouts to support Cho (who had followed through on her promise to drag Harry and Cedric to the pitch on the first day back) or, more likely, as a scout for Slytherin, a job relegated to the low man on the team's totem pole. If that was the case, he didn't seem to mind.

Cedric sat to his left. Cedric's tryout had been a nail-biter. Gabriel Truman had graduated, leaving a vacancy at Seeker, but Cedric had some unexpected competition from a sixth-year named Hailey Weatherby. She was a short, willowy brunette who could turn on a dime, and even with Cedric's superior skill, it was a close-run thing. He'd caught the Snitch in an all-out desperation dive, nearly crashing. Nevertheless, Cedric Diggory was Hufflepuff's newly-minted Seeker.

Harry's own tryout had been rather anticlimactic: he'd been the only one trying out for the Seeker position, Oliver Wood had started hyperventilating at the sight of Harry's Nimbus Two-Thousand, and after seeing Harry fly it for less than ten seconds, he waved him down and moved on to the Chasers. Harry had stayed to watch Katie audition for, and ultimately win a spot on the Chaser line with her friends Angelina and Alicia.

"This is taking forever," muttered Cedric. The Ravenclaw Captain was conferring with the rest of the team while the Chaser hopefuls hovered in the air, anxiously awaiting their fate.

"They are fairly meticulous about it," said Vaisey. Harry couldn't tell if his tone was irritation or grudging respect. "Ravenclaws. They probably have some sort of vote and weighted average scoring system."

After another minute, the Ravenclaw team broke their huddle and the Captain signaled to one of the people hovering in the air – Harry cautiously tagged him as Davies. Roland Davies? Rick Davies? Something like that. Davies pumped his fist and flew down to receive congratulations. Next up were the Seekers. Harry watched as Cho lined up with the other two candidates: a fifth-year Harry didn't know, and Eddie Carmichael from their year.

"Okay," muttered Cedric. "You can do this."

"Steady on, Diggory," said Vaisey. "It's not like you're trying out."

"I know that," said Cedric, his eyes locked on the pitch. "I just… I really want this for her. You have no idea how much it means to her."

"I have some idea," said Vaisey. "I know how much it meant to me."

The three Seeker candidates kicked off and started doing laps around the pitch. The Ravenclaw Captain called out instructions – Harry couldn't make them out from the top of the stands – and directed them through a series of quick-twitch maneuvering drills. Cho came out of them looking very good indeed, to Harry's eye, but Eddie Carmichael outflew her on the next round of drills, which were mostly speed-based.

Cedric was practically on the edge of his seat.

"Stop worrying so much, Cedric," said Harry. "Just wait for the hand-eye drills; she's golden."

Harry's comment turned out to be prophetic. The Ravenclaw Captain pulled out a bag of golf balls and started Banishing them into the air. Cho and the others scurried after them, swooping and diving. After a dozen or so, one of the Chasers started enchanting the balls to cheat gravity a little, zigzagging from a parabolic arc and bouncing in random directions.

Cho snapped them up like candy, including one particularly memorable catch that she made under Eddie Carmichael's nose while inverted.

In the end, she was the easy choice, and her whoop of triumph was audible at the top of the stands. Cho barely stuck around long enough to shake the hands of the Ravenclaw team before she hopped back on her broom and shot up towards Harry and Cedric. She dismounted, her broom clattering off the bench as she threw herself at them, catching each of them around a shoulder with one arm. She was laughing, smiling so hard Harry thought she looked a bit deranged, and the three of them collapsed on the bench in a tangle of arms and legs.

"Congratulations, Cho," said Vaisey, edging back from them a bit. "Now, would you get up? People are starting to stare."

Cho straightened up, rearranging her Quidditch robes. Harry fiddled with his glasses, which were askew.

"This is going to be strange and awkward," said Cedric, "but for now, let's just enjoy the moment."

They walked down the stairs and away from the pitch, Vaisey shaking Cho's hand and peeling off as they neared the field. He jogged over to the Ravenclaw team, which was dispersing, and started talking with the new Chaser, Davies. Harry, Cho, and Cedric kept walking out of the stadium and towards the castle.

Cedric tugged on Cho's arm when they were about halfway there, directing them to a little copse of trees between the Black Lake and the edge of the Forbidden Forest proper.

"Hey now," said Harry. "Let's keep it at least a hundred feet away from the lake. How long are the tentacles on the Giant Squid, anyway? Maybe two hundred feet would be safer."

"This is an interesting new side of you, Harry," said Cho, plopping down on the matted turf and starting to tug off her thick leather gloves. "Why can't you be afraid of something sensible, like snakes?"

"I can talk to snakes. I can ask them nicely not to murder me in my sleep. I can't ask the Black Lake not to be huge and unsettling."

Cedric was rummaging around in his messenger bag, shifting aside rolls of parchment. "They're in here somewhere… hah!" He pulled out three dusty bottles of butterbeer, twisted off the caps, and handed them out.

"Anyway, nice work getting the spot, Cho," said Harry. "I was confident the whole time that you'd get it. Cedric wasn't. He was a mess."

"That's sweet," said Cho, glancing at Cedric, ducking her head and smiling.

"Hey! I was the one who had complete faith in your abilities and everything."

Cedric cleared his throat, cutting them off. He held up his bottle, and Cho and Harry followed suit. "To the Seekers," he said softly. They clinked the bottles together, and drank.

"It is going to be weird, being against each other all the time," said Harry, wiping off his mouth. "We'll just have to agree that whichever one of us is in the stands is a neutral party. That, and to beat the hell out of Slytherin."

"I think I can live with that," said Cedric.

"No hard feelings when we win the Cup," said Cho, and her smile was cocky but also a little uncertain.

"Right," said Harry. He took another drink, the liquid settling in his gut like a pleasant, gentle fire. "No hard feelings."



* * *



The weeks seemed to blend into each other, and before Harry even realized it, it was October. Then, mid-October.

It had all spiraled out of control so quickly. Cedric had extra classes, Cho was gently strong-armed into spending more time with the Ravenclaw girls, Harry was spending more and more free time in dusty, unexplored hallways of the castle with his mother's journal in his hand, retracing her steps, and they all had Quidditch practice at three separate times. Just like that, the time Harry actually spent with his two best friends was cut down to hurried conversations in the Great Hall, and times like the present moment.

The Library was faintly buzzing with activity; it was Sunday night and everyone was tense, dashing off the weekend's homework and casting ever-more-nervous glances at the clock as curfew approached.

"This is mental," said Cedric, throwing his quill down. "Arithmancy makes no sense to me. Why am I memorizing the magical properties of numbers and how they interact with each other? What's the application? Three pages of calculations and the only useful thing I can figure is that stirring a Boil-Cure Potion nineteen times will definitely make it…" he looked down at his notes, his brow furrowed. "Explode. Or, evaporate. Something bad, anyway."

"It's more about modeling and safeguards than figuring out new information," said Harry absently, scratching his ear as he pored over a dense text, his eyes never leaving the page. "A lot of spell creation and stuff like that is based on trial and error, and the 'error' part can be pretty lethal if you don't know what you're doing. So you use arithmancy to get you halfway there, where your wand movement should take so many seconds or the incantation should be so many syllables, and then you're in the safety margin where trying something new isn't going to kill you. Probably."

Cho blinked. "Where did you even learn that?"

"I heard…" he glanced up, looking around at the nearby tables. "Dumbledore explained it once. He and Flamel were having some kind of debate about alchemy. Most of it went straight over my head, but, you know, it was kind of interesting, and I looked up a few things…" Harry trailed off, almost embarrassed.

"Well," said Cedric tersely, "maybe you can tutor me. Or at least explain this daft book." He reached into his bag and brought out a thick textbook, which he placed on the table with an audible thump. "The Muggle who wrote it was either insane or some kind of genius, or both."

Cho leaned forward, studying the book. She looked dubious. "You're telling me a Muggle wrote a book called Mysterium Cosmographicum?"

"Like I said, mental," said Cedric. "Bloke goes on and on about shapes. Seems to think they're fairly important, I gather."

"I'll gladly trade you," said Harry, sighing over his own book. "I'm pretty much wasting my time with this one."

"What are you reading, anyway?" asked Cho.

Harry flipped the book closed and showed them the cover; the dark green leather had faded, and the title was barely visible in black lettering – Quintessence: A Quest.

"Isn't that a sixth-year Charms book?" Cedric flipped it open and started paging through it.

"Yeah," said Harry. "It doesn't even talk about specific Charms. It's all about unifying magical theory on a deeper level, finding common threads between separate areas of magic, tapping magical potential in uncommon objects, stuff like that. I've been reading the same page for fifteen minutes and I still don't know what I'm reading, other than it's in English."

"Why are you even trying?" asked Cedric, who closed the book with a snap.

Harry shrugged. "Remus said it changed my mum's life. Though he told me, straight-up, that he and Sirius could never make anything of it." He shook his head, then looked away for second. "Figured I owed it to her to try, at least."

Neither Cho nor Cedric had anything to say to that, and the silence was very heavy at the table for a few moments until a welcome distraction approached in the form of two Slytherin first-year girls.

The first one walked right up to the table and addressed Harry and his friends. "Hello, I'm Daphne Greengrass," she said. She had an easy smile, long, wavy black hair, and sea-green eyes. "My friend Tracey and I are trying to round up some of the lower years for the first meeting of the Inter-House Cooperation Committee."

Cho frowned. "What's the Inter-House Cooperation Committee?"

"Glad you asked!" said Daphne with a warm smile. "Tracey and I started it a few days ago." She indicated the other girl, who had hung back. Tracey was a tiny little thing with a blonde pixie-cut, blue eyes, and a fairly intense scowl, which was evenly distributed between Harry, Cedric, and Cho.

"I.H.C.C. is a group dedicated to fostering friendship and cooperation between the Houses," chirped Daphne. "Tracey and I noticed a distinct lack of those things between our own House and the rest of the school, and, well, we decided to do something about it."

Tracey didn't say anything, but her glare twitched in Daphne's direction, making it clear to all and sundry who had been the instigator, and who had been dragged along for the ride.

"Your House," said Cedric, carefully ignoring Tracey's death-glare, "being Slytherin, correct?"

"Was the crest on our robes enough of a clue, or did you have to start a formal investigation?" said Tracey. Her first entry into the conversation was punctuated with a heavy dollop of sarcasm.

Harry cleared his throat. "Um. Nice to meet you. You said your group is called 'ick,' right?"

"I.H.C.C.," said Daphne. She blinked, a tiny frown marring her otherwise sunny disposition. "You know, that name might need a bit of a tweak."

"Perhaps," said Harry. "What exactly is this meeting going to be like? Everyone sits around in a circle and sings campfire songs, then we take turns doing trust falls?"

"Something like that. There will," said Daphne solemnly, "be ice cream."

"Well, I'm sold," said Cedric.

"I'm so glad," muttered Tracey as she started to tug Daphne away. "Come on, you said we only had to do this for an hour."

"See you there!" said Daphne even as she was dragged away. "Good luck this weekend! To, um, both of you." She glanced between Harry and Cho, blushed, and then turned away. All of a sudden, Tracey wasn't having to put in nearly as much work getting Daphne away.

"Good luck to both of us?" asked Cho. "What does that even mean? Quidditch is a zero sum game – either way, one of us is walking off the pitch a loser."

Harry winced. "Do you have to put it like that, Cho? This is going to be hard enough as it is."

"I don't see what's so hard about it," said Cedric. "We just do our best, and everything will be fine."

"Yeah," said Harry. "Everything will be fine."



* * *



Harry found that he really did enjoy Quidditch. He hadn't thought he would. He'd gone to the games last year, and he'd practiced with the Gryffindor team for more than a month, and nothing about those experiences had thrilled him.

This thrilled him.

There was so much noise. Harry could hear it over the rush of air as he zoomed around the stadium. Lee Jordan's voice echoed around the pitch in staccato bursts, the crowd noise swelled as Ravenclaw's Chaser line swooped down in formation and attacked again, and a great rush of sound rose up as Oliver Wood blocked the shot.

The smaller noises stood out, too. The crack of Fred Weasley's bat as he walloped a Bludger at Rodger Davies. The whistle of air as Harry and Cho passed each other going opposite directions at a combined speed that was normally reserved for airplanes. The faint creaking of Harry's padded leather armguards as he hauled his broom over and into a tight, controlled turn.

Harry tore his eyes away from the pitch and glanced at the scoreboard for a second, long enough to see RAVENCLAW: 170 / GRYFFINDOR: 140. This game is going to come down to me and Cho, he thought grimly.

Almost casually, Harry swooped down and intercepted the Quaffle, dumping it off to Alicia with a back-pass. He shadowed the Gryffindor Chasers as they formed up, attacking in a loose triangle formation. Harry peeled off, drawing the fire of a Ravenclaw Beater, the wind ruffling his hair as he corkscrewed out of the iron ball's path.

Then he saw her. Cho had taken herself out of the play, rocketing away from it, diving towards the ground. Harry swore, braking sharply and tearing after her. It was no trick – Harry caught the golden glint of the Snitch just a few feet off the ground, flickering a few feet in random directions like a hummingbird.

Harry coaxed his broom to its top speed, gaining on Cho. As if sensing their approach, the Snitch took off, shooting along the grass towards one of the high walls circling the pitch. Taking a short angle to the wall, Harry skimmed alongside it as he dove, hoping to cut off the erratically buzzing Snitch. He could hear the roar of the crowd break down into individual shouts as he got closer to the stands.

Cho was coming in hot; she started to angle away from the wall as she slid into a pursuit line behind the Snitch. Harry had about a second as he dove towards her to make his move – he could either drop right in front of her, "sweeping her face" (as the Quidditch slang went) with his tail-twigs, pull right alongside her and try to muscle her into the wall, or slide in behind her and hope to use drafting to slingshot past her and make the grab. Of course, none of these options went through his head fully formed – it was the instinctual, split-second calculation born of training and talent.

He hesitated, and the choice was made for him.

Cho scooted out of reach, and he slid in behind her. His moment of hesitation had cost him: he wasn't quite close enough to really be drafting effectively, and even as he accelerated, holding himself flat to the broom, he knew he was too late.

As he shot over Cho's left shoulder, moving to cut her off, all he got was a good look at her fist closing around the struggling golden ball.

Harry felt his stomach drop into his shoes as he braked, hard, and came to a stop, barely hearing the whistle, the roar of the crowd. He hovered in the air, staring at the ground, seeing the Ravenclaw team mob Cho out of the corner of his eye.

"Tough loss, Harry."

"Get 'em next time, eh?"

His teammates flew over to him, nudging his shoulder, taking their time, subdued and putting on brave faces. Katie Bell gave him a wistful little smile and a pat on the shoulder, and Harry felt lower than dirt.

It wasn't that they'd lost, exactly, although losing didn't feel good, but…

"Potter." Oliver Wood hovered next to him, giving him an inscrutable look. He gestured towards the ground, towards one end of the stadium and the tunnel that led to the changing rooms. "Follow me."

Wood didn't say anything, and they flew slowly.

"I'll do better next time," said Harry, blurting it out.

"I know you will, and that's what scares me," said Wood.

Harry looked at him askance.

"I knew you were friends with the Hufflepuff Seeker when I brought you on, and I wasn't thrilled about it," said Wood. "I was even less thrilled when your other friend made her team." He inclined his head towards Cho, who'd flown down to the tunnel and was still receiving hearty congratulations from the Ravenclaws. "A friend is bad enough, but a friend, and a girl besides…"

"It's not like that," said Harry quickly.

"Isn't it?" said Wood. "If we'd been playing Slytherin, and that had been Higgs, you wouldn't have slammed him up against the boards?"

Harry bit his lip, and scowled. The two of them landed, gently, just inside the tunnel.

"That's what I thought," said Wood. He fixed Harry with a flat, level stare. "Don't do it again," he said. Then he sighed, and muttered, "I hate this part." He walked over to the Ravenclaw Captain and extended a hand.

Cho broke off from the crowd and approached. Harry knew he was in trouble the moment he saw her face. She was flushed, and behind the excitement, behind the thrill of victory, there was a healthy dose of anger.

Her face a thunderstorm, she walked right up to Harry, stood in front of him. He was still perched on his broom, hovering, his feet dragging on the ground.

"Did you do that on purpose?" she asked. "Did you let me win?"

"No!" said Harry. "I just… didn't want to hurt you."

Cho shoved him, hard. Harry tumbled off his broom and fell head over heels onto the ground. He yelped in pain as he hit the solid ground of the tunnel at an awkward angle.

"The feeling isn't mutual," said Cho. She knelt down, and her expression was one of the most complex Harry had ever seen. "I am not a doll. If our positions were reversed, and it had been me coming in over the top like that, would you have held it against me if I'd swept your face? You had the angle, I saw it. Come on. Would you have cried about it? Stopped being my friend? Thought I was a monster?"

"No," said Harry, dusting off his legs and sitting up, a heavy feeling of guilt keeping him on the ground.

"That's right," she said. "When I step on to the pitch, I show up to play. Do me the same favor next time."

She got up, and looked away, and Harry saw her struggle with herself for a second. Then she reached out and extended a hand.

Harry took it, and Cho pulled him to his feet.

She grabbed a handful of his robes and pulled him close. Their faces were almost touching. Her eyes were big and dark. "Don't ever do it again, Harry."

"I won't," he said.

She turned away, and then looked back. "Better not talk to me for about a week if you don't want me to flip out and hex you. You spoiled the best moment of my life so far. Fair warning."

"Right."

It took Harry a few minutes to get up. By the time he did, the tunnel was empty, and it was a long, slow walk to the changing rooms.



* * *



At the best of times, Potions was a trying experience. This was not the best of times. True to his word, Harry hadn't spoken to Cho in days. Compounding matters, today was Halloween. Harry didn't consider himself to be a particularly morbid person, but he could never escape those deep, dark thoughts on the anniversary of his parents' murder. It wasn't a good combination – spending more time alone than he was used to, and this big, heavy, important day. Contacting Sirius on the mirror helped, but Harry had to be careful about where he used the thing, and he was starting to feel a bit guilty about leaning on Sirius so much, anyway.

The little things became not so little. Neville Longbottom canvased the Common Room for his toad for the sixth time, and Harry snapped at him. Professor Doge kept giving him these odd glances in Defense, and Harry was irritated enough that he almost confronted the man about it. His teammates were cool towards him, though they'd warmed up a little at the next practice. And Cedric was spending most of his time with Cho.

"I might have done the same thing," he'd confessed during a brief conversation in the corridors between classes that day, "and I'm glad I'll never have to find out. I'll be sure not to hold back when it's my turn, I mean. But I'm with her on this one, Harry. If you'd eased up on me, I'd have punched you."

Harry grimaced as he cut up a newt tail into thin slices. Potions was an irritation all by itself, and today…

"McLaggen, please explain to me why you chose to boil your potion to the point of uselessness?" asked Snape in that silkily-smooth voice that Harry couldn't stand.

"Vaisey, your work is… acceptable," said Snape, robes swishing as he moved away from Vaisey's table. Vaisey was currently struggling to stir his potion, which had the consistency of wet cement.

Harry rolled his eyes. Snape had never been a particularly unbiased teacher, and Harry firmly believed he'd have to literally concoct the Elixir of Life to earn an O from the man.

Concentrating on his potion wasn't a terribly effective way to distract himself. Harry absently adjusted the heat, damping the fire below his cauldron, his mind elsewhere. He'd gone over it again and again – that moment of hesitation, when he'd backed off. If he hadn't hesitated, and he'd drafted behind Cho correctly, he might have at least contested the catch. He hadn't meant to hesitate. In his head, he hadn't thought, oh, she's a girl, I'd better back off. But, if Harry was honest about it, that sentiment was there. Buried deep, perhaps, and not easily acknowledged, but there all the same.

It was a problem. The day, Halloween, was a day of what ifs for Harry. What if I hadn't backed off Cho? What if my parents were still alive? Hardly equal questions. But they both nagged at him, wore at him, refused to leave him alone.

"Class dismissed," said Snape. "Those of you who have managed to produce acceptable potions, leave a sample at the front table. The majority of you should simply hang your head in shame at your woefully lacking abilities."

Harry let the class file out. He took his time bottling a sample of his own Swelling Solution, and made his way to the front table just as the last of the students filed out.

Setting his sample down in the little wooden rack along with the others, he looked up to see Snape's dark eyes studying him.

"Why's it have to be like this, Snape?" murmured Harry. "You're not this much of a git during the summer."

"Ten points from Gryffindor, Potter," said Snape, almost reflexively. He leaned forward. "And if I hear you mention anything unrelated to Potions class to me during the school year again, points shall be the least of your worries."

"Fine, be that way," snapped Harry. "I was going to invite you over for tea, but, you know, now I'm just not feeling it."

He stormed from the classroom. He really was starved for company if he was considering a chat with Snape, of all people, Harry thought with a wry grin.

Harry made his way to the library. Cho and Cedric were there, and he almost went over to them, but chickened out at the last second. Cho probably wouldn't really hex him, but whenever they'd crossed paths over the last few days, she'd seemed a bit… twitchy.

Instead, Harry sat down next to Hermione Granger. Harry hadn't had a chance to speak to the first-year girl much, despite seeing her in the Common Room nearly every day. From what he could tell, she was reasonably bright, very studious, and, to hear Fred and George's younger brother tell it, a complete teacher's pet.

She looked up from her work. Her fingers were ink-stained, and the parchment she was working on was a few feet long, with very small writing. "Why aren't you with your friends?"

Harry rolled his shoulders, uncomfortable. "My friends aren't very happy with me right now."

Hermione glanced across the room, looking at Cho and Cedric. "Why not?"

"Because I didn't crash into one of them on my broom."

Frowning, the brunette nibbled the point of her quill for a second. Harry could practically see her working through the problem as she shifted through several subtle expressions.

"That doesn't make any sense. That can't be why," she said at last, with an air of finality.

"Let me put it in a more personally familiar way," said Harry. "Would you like an extra five points on all your tests because you're a girl?"

"No," she said, frowning, her nose wrinkling into an immediate and endearing look of grave injustice.

"That's why."

They were quiet for a few minutes. Harry closed his eyes and rested his head against the library table. The scratching of Hermione's quill was almost soothing.

"You should apologize to her," said Hermione after a while. Harry looked up, and saw that she was looking over at Cedric and Cho with a wistful, closed-off expression on her face. "Good friends are very important, so I'm told."

Harry didn't quite know what to say to that. If he'd been in a better mood, he might have summoned up the empathy to befriend her, or even just console her. As it was, he kind of awkwardly patted her back, mumbled something about needing to send off a letter, and slunk away.

After a quick detour to the dorms to fetch a few items from his trunk, Harry went to the Owlery. Hedwig greeted him from the rafters with a sedate hoot. The air was rather cold and drafty, but not quite drafty enough to mask the scent of dozens of owls.

"Fancy a fly, girl?" said Harry, hefting his broom.

Hedwig ruffled her feathers, leaning forward excitedly, and spread her wings. She dove, soaring majestically through one of the many open-air windows in the tower. Harry grinned and dove after her, tipping over his broom and falling out the window, savoring the rush of air and the way his nerves tingled as he fell, his body unaware for a second that it wasn't plummeting to its death.

He pulled up, leveling out, and took off after Hedwig, who was winging her way around Ravenclaw Tower. Harry followed at a moderate pace, the bag he had slung across his back preventing him from anything too audacious.

Hedwig led him around the perimeter of the castle, finally soaring upwards in a lazy spiral, not headed anywhere in particular.

Harry put on a burst of speed and pulled alongside her. "Come on, let's head down. I've got a letter for you to send, just as soon as I write it." Harry extended an arm, pointing, and Hedwig dipped a wing, and they both descended towards the edge of the Forbidden Forest near Hagrid's hut.

Alighting, Harry carefully set aside his broom and opened his bag. He pulled out a quill and parchment and a well-worn French/English dictionary. Using his wand, he carefully conjured a small stone tablet. It would serve as a writing surface, if not a great one. A desk would have been preferable, but that was beyond Harry's ability, at least for now.

Hedwig perched in a nearby tree, preening herself, and Harry began to write, methodically consulting the dictionary. It was the painstaking work of nearly an hour to put down even a few relatively simple sentences in what Harry hoped was passable French.

Dear Fleur,

Thank you for the letter. I am fine. It was very nice to meet you, too. You are an excellent flier, even better than a dragon. Ha ha. I will try to learn your language better so I don't sound like an idiot. Enclosed is a picture of Hogwarts. I hope you like it. Your parents' house is nice/charming/quaint. I'm not sure I used the right word there. Something good, anyway. I hope you have a good year. I'll write you again.

-Harry

Harry rolled up the letter, tied it off with a bit of string, and then whistled sharply. Hedwig spread her wings and glided down from her tree.

"What do you say, girl?" asked Harry as he tied the letter to her leg. "Think you're up for it? All the way to Beauxbatons?"

Hedwig's reply was to cuff him with her wing, and then take to the air. Harry watched her until she was just a speck on the horizon, then started to clean up, stuffing the leftover parchment and quill back into his bag. This done, he sighed and closed his eyes for a moment. Writing to Fleur had been a good distraction, but now it was over, and it was still Halloween, and he still missed talking to Cho and Cedric.

He pulled out the wooden flute Hagrid had given him, feeling the weight of it. Glancing around to make sure he was alone, Harry started to play. He hadn't spent too much time learning the instrument, but he'd practiced enough that he could get through a few tunes and have them come out at least recognizable, if a bit warbling.

It felt good. He sank into the music, and it had the intended effect. He was playing, and not thinking. He found himself starting the same song over again as he finished it. Maybe it was time to ask Hagrid for another lesson; the enormous man knew an impressive array of Irish folk tunes.

He looked up, the last few notes of "The Flower of the Flock" trailing off. There was a light coming from the Forbidden Forest. It was red-gold and glowing faintly, just barely visible through the trees. Harry watched it for a few seconds. It seemed almost like a will-o'-the-wisp, the way it flickered sporadically. Something about it drew Harry to his feet, though. He stuffed the flute back in his bag, grabbed his broom, mounted it, and started forward, slowly, mindful of fairy tales of dancing lights that lured travelers to their doom.

The light seemed to recede as he approached, skirting through the sparse, outlying trees of the Forest.

Harry ghosted through the trees, the lack of noise as he guided his broom towards the light a bit unsettling.

As he sped forward, he saw it for just a second before it ducked out of sight around a tree. It was a bird. A bird with red-gold plumage, whose feathers cast a flickering light, more noticeable now in the darkening shadows of the forest. It had a long tail, which swished as the bird turned around to regard Harry with coal-black eyes.

Harry stopped, going still. He felt…something. The bird wasn't just looking at him, it was looking. It had a kind of presence to it. Harry was just about to move forward, or speak, or do something, when the bird vanished in a soft explosion of fire.

Letting out an inarticulate exclamation of surprise, Harry drew his wand. It became clear after a few seconds that there was nothing there; the bird was simply gone. After a few moments of furious thought, Harry reached into his robes, into the secret pocket, and pulled out a mirror.

"Sirius Black," he muttered, holding it close to his mouth.

"Harry?" said Sirius's voice. The image in the mirror wobbled, and tilted up to show Sirius, blinking, his hair in disarray. "What's wrong? Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. I just wanted to ask you something."

Sirius stared at him. "Do you know what time it is?"

"No."

"Neither do I," said Sirius. "Which means it's some god-awful hour in the middle of the night. What is it?"

"Is there a phoenix that lives in the Forbidden Forest?"

Sirius smiled, albeit sleepily. "Oh, you met Fawkes?"

"The phoenix has a name?"

"Sure," said Sirius. "He helped James and I out of a few tight spots when we got in a little too much trouble with the centaurs. Fawkes is kind of like Hogwarts' mascot, or its guardian or something. I think Albus named him – I know they've crossed paths before. I remember Aberforth telling a story about a phoenix saving their bacon during the Grindelwald days; I think that was Fawkes."

"Huh," said Harry. He glided forward, moving to where the phoenix had vanished. The grass wasn't even scorched.

"Your mum was interested in him," said Sirius, smiling fondly. "She asked us all kinds of questions about Fawkes once your dad and I let it slip that we'd met him."

"Oh…" said Harry, something clicking in his head as he put together disparate pieces of information. His mum's journal, near the end, had been singularly focused on the Founders, on how they'd left clues for clever students to uncover, secrets built into the walls of Hogwarts itself, and one of those secrets…

"Do you need something else?" said Sirius. "I want to go back to sleep and pretend this was just an odd dream."

"Sure, go ahead, I'll talk to you later," said Harry absently. His brain was practically whirring, and he was itching to get back to his dorm and pore over his mother's journal.

Sirius signed off without a word, his head hitting the pillow before the image faded back into an ordinary mirror.

Stowing the mirror back in his robes, Harry turned around his Nimbus Two-Thousand and sped back through the trees, past Hagrid's hut, and towards the castle. As he neared the massive gates to the Entrance Hall, he dismounted and walked forward. As he approached, he heard a tumult of sound, and realized that he was probably walking into the middle of dinner.

That's right, the Halloween Feast. Well, it's supposed to be good, and I have to eat sometime… Harry was already moving ahead of dinner, at least mentally. He'd ask Katie about the phoenix book, get the title from her, run to the library and get it before it closed, cross-reference facts from it with his mother's journal, use the Cloak to sneak out after-hours, and by morning he could have found a Founder's Chamber with an unimaginable treasure trove of knowledge.

He had to get through dinner first, though.

Resigned to another lonely, loud meal (the addition of Ron to Percy, Fred and George had drastically increased the number of loud arguments at the Gryffindor Table, owing to something Oliver Wood called Weasley Critical Mass), Harry pushed the doors open.

He was confronted with chaos. Hardly anyone was sitting; the entire Hall was filled with students milling about, coalescing into groups and then breaking apart, like some kind of massive school of fish. A dozen shouts and a hundred more moderate voices mixed into a wall of sound that assaulted Harry as he walked inside. Up at the Head Table, Aberforth Dumbledore had his hands spread, gesturing, trying to maintain some semblance of order.

"Prefects!" called Aberforth, his voice magically enhanced. "I want head-counts for all years in five minutes. Students, please remain at your House table and stay quiet!"

Harry grabbed a passing seventh-year Hufflepuff, even as he scanned the room for Cedric and Cho. "What's happening?" he asked her. "I just got here."

"There's a huge fire on the second floor," she said. "It's mostly contained in a hallway, and all the professors are busy dealing with it. You should get to your table and check in with a prefect."

"I'll do that," said Harry, though he didn't move. For a second, he thought – fire, phoenix… but, no, it couldn't be.

He took a step towards the crowd, finally having spotted Cho at the Ravenclaw table, and then he felt something grip his arm sharply. Twisting, Harry saw nothing, but nevertheless he stumbled through the door and into the little anteroom just off the Entrance Hall. It was the same little room where he'd waited to be Sorted with the rest of the first-years.

Harry wrenched himself out of the invisible grip, diving into his robes for his wand. For the sixteenth time, he swore to himself he was going to start wearing his father's Auror holster around the castle, no matter how self-conscious it made him feel.

"Who's there?" he said. Hearing nothing, he swept his wand in a broad arc and muttered, "Inrita."

"Interesting," said Professor Doge, shimmering into view, his Disillusionment Charm breaking. "You didn't use a Finite. You used a more specific, more powerful Countering Charm. Care to explain that, Mr. Potter?"

"Care to explain why you dragged me into this room, and why you're not helping the other professors with the fire?" asked Harry, not lowering his wand.

"It's quite simple," said Doge. "I started the fire in order to guarantee us a private conversation."

Harry blinked, the tip of his wand twitching up. "You started a fire so you could talk to me? That's incredibly dangerous. Not to mention a bit crazy."

"No one will be hurt," said Doge, waving his hand. "However, it's a magical fire that will prove tricky to deal with, and the Headmaster needed all hands on deck, so to speak… including those troublesome Aurors who're so inconveniently underfoot."

"Tell me what you want, or I start casting."

"Indeed?" said Doge, quirking an eyebrow. "I find myself curious as to just what would come out of your wand if you did. You've been a bit careful in my class this year, Mr. Potter. But to the trained eye, you're quite clearly holding back. I daresay you've had a rather…unique…. head-start when it comes to learning magic."

"And what would you know about that?" said Harry. He glanced behind him at the closed door, and tightened the grip on his wand.

"Rather a lot," said Doge. It struck Harry just how different Doge was out of class… he was much more animated, more present, than he was as a Professor, where he was competent but boring. He leaned forward. "Tell me, Mr. Potter. What do you know of the Dumbledore siblings?"

"Just the usual things," said Harry guardedly. "Aberforth is the Headmaster, Albus is the disgraced Chief Warlock-in-exile."

"Ah," said Doge. "Not them. Their sister, Ariana."

"I know she's at St. Mungo's," said Harry. "Not much else."

"Then I think you'll find what I have to say quite interesting," said Doge. "And the first thing you should know is that her last name isn't Dumbledore, and hasn't been for quite some time. It's Doge."





7. Chapter 7

Chapter 6 – The Nature of Ravenclaws

Cho Chang looked around the Great Hall, weighing and measuring. The Headmaster had swept out of the room a few minutes ago, leaving a beleaguered Filch and a gaggle of prefects to maintain order over the balance of the student body. It was a tall order: in under a minute, people were milling around, gravitating towards friends, exchanging gossip, forming groups.

It was a rare opportunity to observe people. Cho had a certain talent and interest in that area. She found it fascinating – the invisible lines that drew people together and kept them apart, the subtle flow of status, the magnetic pull of charisma.

Or, if she was being honest with herself, it was that gossiping about people was just plain fun.

"How do you think the fire started?" asked Marietta.

"Do you think anyone is hurt?" Lisa Turpin looked around furtively, as if afraid to see someone missing from the crowd.

"Do you think we're safe here?" Anthony Goldstein craned his neck over the mass of students. "If we have to leave in a hurry, people are going to stampede through the doors."

The Ravenclaw lower years were talking in low voices, congregated in a loose huddle at one end of their House table.

"We'll be fine," said Cho, with more certainty than she felt. "Flitwick and McGonnagall could deal with a fire in their sleep. The Professors are just being cautious."

Their little group settled down; Cho could practically taste it. Shoulders relaxed, hands stilling from nervous tapping, breathing slowing down. Cho couldn't help but feel a little thrill at how they listened to her, how her words carried a kind of active power. She noticed it more and more when she was in class, in the Common Room, and at meals – she had, without really paying attention too hard to how or why, acquired something of a leadership role amongst her classmates. It was exciting to have that, but at the same time, it was shallow – she never felt truly listened to like she did with Cedric and –

Cho stood up, her eyes widening, glancing quickly around the room. Oh, no.

She zeroed in on Cedric and moved towards him, navigating through the crowd, barely hearing the questioning voices of her friends as she jogged to the Hufflepuff table.

Cedric was deep in conversation with his teammates – the Hufflepuff / Slytherin match was next on the docket, and Cedric's Quidditch Camp-inspired plays and strategies had evidently gone over very well with the team.

Shoving through the crowd, Cho reached out and tugged on Cedric's arm. He looked over at her, breaking off mid-sentence, those patient, grey eyes taking in her worried expression instantly. He stood up. "What is it, Cho?"

"Where's Harry? Have you seen him?"

Cedric glanced over to the Gryffindor table. "He's not over there?"

"No, he's not."

"That doesn't necessarily mean he's in trouble," said Cedric, turning slowly in place, his eyes sweeping the Great Hall.

Cho gave Cedric a flat, disbelieving stare. "It's Harry. Of course he's in trouble. Whenever something goes wrong, Harry will get involved, and always at the worst possible time. It's like a law of nature or something. Remember the dragon sanctuary?"

"Point taken," said Cedric. "We should tell a Gryffindor prefect. Come to think of it, how come they haven't noticed he's not here? They're supposed to be counting everyone."

"Fred and George Weasley keep shooting Color-Change Charms at people's hair; the prefects keep losing count."

"That's not funny," said Cedric, scowling. "That's too far."

Cho shrugged, impatient, and took Cedric's arm again, guiding him towards the door. "Priorities, Cedric. The prefects won't do anything. We need to find Harry, or a professor, right now."

"Yeah, you're right," said Cedric, drawing his wand out of his robes. Cho watched Cedric's face lock down into a serious, focused look that was quite fetching. He looked, thought Cho, like his goal was the most important thing in the world, and nothing would prevent him from attaining it – all distractions and obstacles swatted aside. If he ever looks at me like that, I'll just die. I'll explode and die. Cho stopped that thought in its tracks, fighting a slow blush. This is so not the time!

Cho took out her own wand, gripping it tightly. "Let's go to the second floor – that's where the fire is. Either we find Harry on the way, or we get to the professors and we tell them he's missing."

"Agreed," said Cedric. He took a step forward, reaching to push open the doorway that would take them to the second floor staircase – and tripped backwards over nothing.

Cho scrambled back as Cedric stumbled, just managing to get out of the way as he hit the ground.

"What the hell?" muttered Cedric as he got to his feet, holding out his wand. "Something pushed me."

Disembodied laughter came from in front of them, followed by a very familiar voice. "You should see your faces."

"Harry!" Cho scowled. "We were worried about you!"

"Could have fooled me." Harry's voice was mild, but it hit Cho like a bucket of cold water anyway.

"This is different," she said. "This is real. Oh, come out from under that ridiculous cloak. I feel silly talking to the air."

The silence was eerie. Cho glanced over her shoulder, making sure they hadn't caught anyone's attention. Thankfully, Ron Weasley, sporting bleach-blond hair, was trying to beat his brothers to death with his own shoe, with Percy Weasley caught in the middle trying to referee. It was a bit of a spectacle, and no one was looking their way.

"Fine," said Harry after a moment. "I need to talk to you guys anyway. Come into the hallway." The door opened, seemingly on its own.

Cho started forward at once, and Cedric joined her. She turned and eased the door closed, the raucous sounds of the Great Hall instantly cutting off. When she turned back to the torch-lit hallway, Harry's head was in the process of appearing, the shimmering, liquid fabric of the Invisibility Cloak pooling around his shoulders.

Harry scrubbed a hand through his hair. "I guess, first of all, can we call a truce for right now? It's important – more important than you being pissed at me, Cho."

"Of course, Harry," said Cho immediately. She stepped forward and locked eyes with him. "This wasn't supposed to be a punishment, you know. I just needed to work through it, for me, and I didn't want to take it out on you."

He rolled his shoulders and dropped his gaze. "I know. I could have used a friend today, is all."

"Today?" asked Cedric. "Why today?"

Harry grimaced and looked away. "Never mind." He took a deep breath. "Doge started the fire. He started it so he could shake his Auror watchers and talk to me."

"Professor Doge?" asked Cedric, a bit doubtfully. Cho agreed with his skepticism – their Defense professor was the blandest teacher she'd ever had, and even the oddity of his return for a second year hadn't made him any more interesting, at least in class.

"That's the one," said Harry, clipped and tense. He started pacing. "I was coming back from the Forest – there is a phoenix there, by the way, Katie was right, and I need to ask her where she got that book – and he pulled me aside. He told me… look, you know that vigilante group I told you about? The Order of the Phoenix? Dumbledore was in it, and Sirius and Remus. My parents, too. And Doge. Doge knew all of them. Not just from that. He was an Unspeakable, and my mum was apparently considering joining, and they were friends, and, oh, why didn't they tell me – "

"Harry, take a breath, mate," said Cedric, stepping forward and clapping a hand to the younger boy's shoulder.

Harry took a breath. He shook his head, closed his eyes for a second. Then he opened them. "Okay. One thing at a time. I have this. Doge gave it to me last year." He reached into his robes, and it looked to Cho – just for a second – like his hand went in at some kind of impossible angle. He came out with a small, leather-bound notebook, worn but obviously cared for.

Cho stepped closer, peering at it. "What is that?"

Harry's fingers traced the cover, the gesture one that looked reflexive, almost reassuring. "My mum's journal," he said softly. "The life and times. She started it when she was fourteen, and there's an entry on the day she died."

Cedric stiffened, went still. "On Halloween."

Harry smiled, but it was hollow. "It wasn't an important entry. It was just another day for her. Just a few scribbled lines about how she wished she could take me trick-or-treating."

The pieces clicked together for Cho a second later, and she felt a hot, quick burst of shame. Harry's face was half-lit by the torches in the hallway, and he wasn't meeting either of their eyes. He didn't have any particular expression on his face, but Cho's heart stuttered in sympathy anyway – the obvious effort he was putting into keeping it together was more eloquent than tears would have been.

And yet she hesitated. Her first instinct was to go to him – a hug, a connection, an apology. Some deeper sense told her not to, though. She'd known Harry Potter for more than a year, and she had a sense of him, now, a sense of his character. And she knew, in a burst of intuition, what he would appreciate at this moment. Not pity. Not sympathy. Not an apology.

"I wasn't angry at you because you let me win," said Cho. Her voice hitched, and she took a deep, steadying breath. "I was angry at myself because you even had a chance to. I took a bad angle to the Snitch, or else I'd have had it before you even got there. The reason I was angry at you… it's because you don't care quite as much, and you don't practice quite as hard, and you're still a little bit better."

Harry just looked at her. Cho saw him open his mouth, start to say something, close it again. His expression softened, those expressive green eyes crinkling, the beginning of a smile… Cho leaned forward, reaching out –

"So… Doge gave it to you?" Cedric broke the silence, and Cho could have cheerfully murdered him for it.

"Yeah," said Harry, the moment gone. He held up the journal. "Last year. Passed it to me in Defense, real smooth, transfigured to look like a graded essay. He's pretty cagey about how he got his hands on it, though. The original note said she'd given it to him, but like I said, it's got an entry for the day she was murdered, and that would be a pretty big coincidence. He told me just now that he had it because Lily was thinking about becoming an Unspeakable, that he'd been a mentor and friend."

"And you don't believe him," said Cedric. Cho wasn't the only one who could read Harry Potter.

Harry shrugged. "I don't know. Not really. Sirius and Remus never mentioned him like that, and they've told me plenty of stories about my parents. Maybe she kept it from them for some reason?" He sighed. "She had a few secrets." He shook the diary, holding it out. "For example – the Founders' rooms."

"The what?" Cho blinked, and exchanged a confused look with Cedric.

"Hogwarts legends," said Harry. "You've never heard them? Slytherin's monster, hidden somewhere in the school, waiting to be unleashed on those unworthy of magic? The Sword of Gryffindor at the end of some kind of labyrinthine test of Gryffindor character? Hufflepuff's secret chamber, which only the pure of heart can find, and where some of Hogwarts' most famous Headmasters are entombed? Ravenclaw's room, layered with magic so complex and arcane that it bends itself to your very desires?"

"I've heard of the Hufflepuff one," said Cedric, frowning. "I mean, it's one of those rumors people mention, like that thing with the Headmaster and goats."

"Well, my mum thought there was some truth to them," said Harry. "She wanted to find the Founders' rooms – and so do I."

Cho leaned back against the stone wall of the hallway, deep in thought. "And what does Professor Doge have to do with all this?"

"I'm getting there," said Harry. He was pacing again, agitated. "So, Doge gave me the journal last year. And now today, he corners me and tells me about his wife."

"He's married?" Cho couldn't quite picture it; but then again, it was hard to picture one of their professors doing anything other than standing in front of a classroom or looking down on them from the Head Table with looks of vague disapproval.

"To the Headmaster's sister," said Harry. "Ariana Dumbledore. Doge, now."

"I didn't even know the Headmaster had a sister," said Cedric, frowning.

"I… think I've heard that somewhere," said Cho doubtfully. "She's sick, I think?"

"She's at St. Mungo's, indefinitely," said Harry. "She's been there for years. Doge was a little cagey about what's wrong with her, but whatever it is got worse during the war with Voldemort, and he thinks it's her brothers' fault. They were helping her, apparently, and with the Order taking so much of their time, she… regressed, I think is the word he used?"

"Okay," said Cedric. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "So how are they connected? Doge, Ariana, and your mum's journal?"

"The Gallery of Refuge," said Harry. "Hufflepuff's secret chamber. Doge said he wants something from it – something he can use to heal Ariana."

"And he wants you to get it for him?" asked Cedric. "Why you?"

"Oh, he was very clever," said Harry grimly. "He had a carrot and a stick. He knows about my, er, upbringing, and he very casually mentioned that it would be quite disastrous if anyone in the Ministry found out about it. Then he said, if I do manage to find the Gallery, who knows what else might be there? Certainly something valuable enough to make it worth my time. Oh, yes, he was very persuasive."

"I don't like this, Harry," said Cho. And she didn't. She didn't like knowing that her dotty old Defense professor had a penchant for blackmail, and she didn't like this sprawling history of Dumbledores and Doges and Dark Lords encroaching on her Quidditch and her school and her friends.

Her friends.

"How can we help? What can we do?" she asked wholeheartedly.

Harry seemed to instantly perk up at her enthusiasm. "Let's meet tonight. Midnight – the usual spot." He glanced at Cedric.

"We'll be there," said Cedric. He glanced back at the door. "We should probably…? I mean, we've been here long enough."

"Good thinking," said Cho, turning and walking towards the door. "I'm honestly not sure you two have noticed, but the three of us are kind of conspicuous."



* * *



Cho had perfected sneaking out of Ravenclaw Tower to an art form. In general, her House subscribed to the "early to bed, early to rise" maxim. She simply waited for the Common Room to clear out – usually before ten o'clock – and then slipped away. It was rather anticlimactic. Cho, to her eternal annoyance, had found most of her Housemates were willing – eager, even – to jump wholeheartedly into any stereotypical behavior that would make them seem more intelligent and bookish.

She herself quite enjoyed waking up when she damn well pleased, scribbling though homework as fast as possible in order to devote more time to Quidditch, and spending more time than perhaps was prudent making sure she looked her best.

"I'm going to bed," said Marietta, yawning. She stood up from the couch, stretching. "Oh, before I forget, I need you to take a look at my telescope. Last time in Astronomy I set the Auto-Image feature to a constellation, and it was kind of blurry by the time I was done." She rummaged around in her bag before coming up with the sleek bronze tube, handing it to Cho.

Cho sighed, taking it. That would mean another letter to her parents. They kept sending her new versions of their high-end telescopes, cajoling her to give them to her friends to try out. They harbored a dream of cornering the Hogwarts market, getting new students acclimated to using their products, despite the fact that they were packed with expensive features a typical first year would never need, let alone understand.

Settling in to the couch to wait, she took out a book and dove in. She read steadily, watching people vacate the Common Room until there was just one holdout – a lone seventh-year who was so deeply absorbed in her homework Cho thought it would take a meteor hitting the castle to get her to look up. Satisfied, she stowed her book and got up.

Outside the Tower, she fumbled for a moment with the scrap of paper in her pocket, then pulled it out, unfolding it. It was a map of Hogwarts, roughly sketched, and it showed only a vague layout of each floor. The more interesting part of the map were the two dots moving on it, one labeled Filch and one Mrs. Norris. Harry had given the map to Cho on their first day back, and an identical one to Cedric. He'd said it was based on something his father and his friends had made during their time at Hogwarts, only much, much simpler.

It was the work of a few seconds to place Filch in the Great Hall and Mrs. Norris on the fifth floor, and to plot a route to her destination that would bypass both of them.

Cho moved through the corridors of Hogwarts at a light jog, her socks muffling most of the noise. She stopped every few minutes to consult the map. Not for the first time, she bemoaned the fact that her two best friends were in other Houses. Sneaking around at night was fun, but it was more fun if you had company.

She made it to the basement with a few minutes to spare before midnight. The corridor was unassuming – just a hallway on the way from the Great Hall to the Hufflepuff Common Room. Cho stopped in front of large portrait of a bowl of fruit, reaching out to tickle the pear. It squirmed, shaking with laugher, and then swirled in a twist of paint, expanding out from the tapestry into a small green doorknob.

Swinging the door open and moving down the stairs, Cho walked into the kitchens. It was quiet and warm. The house-elves were few and far between; instead of the insane hustle and bustle of the day, there were only a handful in the long, large room – a copy of the Great Hall with lower ceilings. Down at one end, a group of house-elves were doing dishes, the clang of pots and pans echoing through the room.

Cedric hadn't gotten there yet, but Harry had. He was sitting in front of the large fire that dominated one wall, at a little wooden table that the three of them had frequented many times.

It could have been her stocking feet, or the fact that he was absorbed in the fire, but Harry didn't look up as Cho approached. He was gazing deeply into the fire, his thick glasses set aside on the table. His arms were crossed, and his feet were kicked up on the table, his washed-out jeans riding up enough to reveal a pair of scuffed, comfortable-looking leather boots. His worn, faded shirt was ruffled and messy, the top few buttons left carelessly undone.

As she got closer, Cho noticed his belt – it was a wand holster. Harry wore it low and lopsided, the supple brown leather looking incredibly smooth in the warm firelight.

The image came to her all at once, and it was so incongruous that she almost tripped as she came to a stop in front of him: despite the fact that he wasn't even a teenager, despite the fact that the object in his holster was a wand, despite the fact that they were currently inside a magical castle devoted to witchcraft and wizardry, Harry looked for all the world like a ranch hand, a cowboy, a gunslinger.

Cho tilted her head as she looked at him. Harry looked up from the fire, his eyes meeting hers. They looked at each other for a long, timeless moment.

"Have you ever thought about getting a different pair of glasses?" said Cho, immediately cursing herself for the banality of her question.

Harry squinted, looking down and scrutinizing his thick glasses. He picked them up, flipping them around his fingers idly. "Not really. These work well enough."

"You have such nice eyes, is all," said Cho, sitting down next to him. "Even if your glasses were only a little different, they'd frame your face so much better."

Harry clicked his tongue and grinned at her. "Give it up, Cho. You still don't have a chance at getting those Galleons."

Cho crossed her arms, grinning back, then twisted in her chair, glancing over her shoulder as she heard a noise from the staircase. Cedric walked into the kitchens, yawning.

"Evening," he said, collapsing into a chair. He glared blearily at Harry. "This was a terrible idea."

"It's not my fault you had Astronomy yesterday," said Harry. He swung his legs off the table and leaned forward, taking out the journal. "So." He set it flat on the table and flipped to a page near the end. "This is everything my mum speculated about the Gallery of Refuge."

Cho and Cedric leaned forward as one, reading. Cho had to squint to make out the neat, feminine handwriting.

Helga mythology tied to Cup – magical powers varied; can't all be true. Most tied to healing, but healing liquid, as in potion. Gallery is a tomb or a hall of records; sense of history.

Evidence for existence: Phyllida Spore writes about "Hufflepuff's legacy," references "living memories" in a "gallery." Vindictus Veridian recounts searching for hidden chambers as Headmaster, writes: "Helga's magic is strong and noticeable in the stones of the castle." Hints that he found something "marvelous" near the basement. Expresses annoyance at "Helga's tiresome tests of unity."

Name is important: Refuge. Seek protection, healing, shelter.

And then, frustratingly, there was a single word scribbled in haste at the bottom of the page.

Keys

"Well," said Cedric, "that's not entirely helpful."

"It wasn't, until Doge told me where to start, and what Helga's magic was like," said Harry. "That's the information he wanted to pass along. He's been doing his own research, giving the Aurors the slip every chance he gets, trying to find the Gallery."

"And why are you helping him, Harry?" asked Cho. "You said you had doubts."

"I really do," said Harry. He blew out a long breath and picked up the journal, hefting it. "How he got his hands on this doesn't make sense, and I'm flat-out sure he's holding something back. But the truth is, I want to find the Gallery, and the other three rooms, just as much as he does."

"Why?" asked Cedric. "Why is it so important to you?"

"Voldemort," said Harry simply. Cho and Cedric had heard him say the name enough to brush it off most of the time, and neither reacted visibly. Cho, however, felt a shiver go down her spine. Must be because it's midnight, she thought firmly.

"He's out there," continued Harry. "And I just know it – I feel it, deep down – that he's coming for me. Sometimes, I feel like I know him. I've never met him – well, I guess I did, once, but I'm too young to remember." He grinned weakly at his morbid joke, absently running his fingers over his scar. "And I'll never be ready. I could graduate and spend a decade doing nothing but practicing magic, and I'd still never be ready because Voldemort already did that, and then some."

"Harry…" said Cho, reaching out a hand, tentatively putting it on his shoulder.

"So I need to cheat. I need a shortcut," he said, ignoring her. "I need to work incredibly hard and get better, and then I need something extra on top of it. I need an ace up my sleeve. And if something like that actually exists, that's where I'll find it – in the hidden places."

Cedric looked uneasy. "Do you think… do you think you're going to have to, you know, fight him?"

"I'm sure of it," said Harry, and there was a thread of something dark and deadly running through Harry's voice that Cho recoiled from.

"The way you're making it sound, it's inevitable," said Cedric slowly, working it out. "Almost like…"

"Either he comes for me, or I come for him," said Harry. "He killed my parents. He murdered them. And he's still out there. Do you think, in a million years, that I could ever walk away from that?"

Harry met the stunned silence with a calm, even look. Cho reeled, her entire perception of Harry flipping on its head – and then, reorienting back again. Because, in the end, it was so very Harry that Cho should have known all along that it would be this way.

"Is that wand holster useful?" said Cedric abruptly. "I know most people go in for the wrist version these days. How would you wear that with robes, anyway?"

Harry shrugged, apparently not bothered by the subject change. "Aurors wear those long coats; it works well enough with them, I think. It's better than sticking your wand in your pocket, anyway. And wrist holsters are kind of gimmicky, don't you think?"

"Depends," said Cedric. "I can see the benefits of both. What do you think, Cho?"

Cho just shook her head. If you could count on boys to do one thing, it was the fact that they'd take refuge in mundane and practical things when a conversation moved into emotionally uncharted waters.

"I think," said Cho carefully, "that we should go and start looking for the Gallery now."



* * *



"We've been here before," said Cedric.

"We have," said Harry, looking down at the floor.

"Those are the musical tiles, aren't they?" asked Cho. She stuck out a foot experimentally, tapping one of the slightly off-color tiles scattered among the dark grey tiled floor. As she pressed her toes against it, a soft chime sounded throughout the corridor, a pure tone.

"This is where Hufflepuff's room is? It doesn't seem very… secret-y," said Cedric.

"Were you expecting a gilded sign and flashing lights?" said Harry absently as he ran his eyes over the wall.

"Not as such, no," said Cedric. He nudged a tile with his foot and then skipped lightly to another two, producing a jaunty little fragment of melody. "So what are we looking for, anyway?"

"Known magic," said Harry. He walked along the wall, slowing occasionally, brushing his fingers over the smooth stone, caressing it, almost. He closed his eyes.

Cho watched him, confused and just a little awed. She'd never seen a wizard puzzle something out in this way, simply by touch. He wasn't casting dozens of revealing spells and diagnostic charms – he was just feeling the wall. It was impressive and a little irritating – she quickly stifled an acidic burst of jealousy, but in a fair world, Harry would only be preternaturally talented at just the one thing.

Harry moved to the center of the corridor and stood there for a long moment. "There's something here," he said at last. He bit his lip, closing his eyes, seeming to reach for something, straining… "Damn. I can't get it. I'm just not there yet."

"What are you even doing?" asked Cedric, his voice low. Apparently Cho wasn't the only one with a bit of appreciation for Harry's skill.

"Long-standing magic has kind of a… taste? An imprint," said Harry. "Very, very faint. Hard to detect. But there. The wall is magic like every part of Hogwarts is magic, but there's a door here. It's… more than that. It's – responsive? It's waiting. And hiding, but it wants to be found." Harry let out a frustrated sigh. "Dumbledore is so much better at this."

"Well, yeah," said Cedric with a baffled grin. "He's Dumbledore."

Harry fell silent. He raised his hand, and moved it, pointing, the needle of a compass guided by some strange magnetism. The hand wavered, and his eyes snapped open. "This isn't working," he said, huffing in frustration. "I need to cheat a little. Cho, get behind me. Cedric, you go down the hall a little ways. Start casting the loudest spells you know."

Cedric started forward, drawing his wand, and Cho stepped back. "You're not worried about Filch hearing?"

"What? No," said Harry, bemused. "I mean the most magically loud spells you know."

"Right, obviously," said Cho, putting a heavy dose of sarcasm into her voice. "And what, exactly, is an example of a magically loud spell?"

"You know, something that kicks up a lot of dust," said Harry, waving his hand dismissively. "The Disarming Charm or something."

"Do you understand what he's saying?" called Cedric from the far end of the corridor.

"Not at all," said Cho. "Expelliarmus." She swung her wand at Cedric, who ducked the jet of red light.

"Hey!"

"Just following instructions."

"I'll get you for that, Chang. Expelliarmus!"

Cho twirled away from Cedric's spell, grinning.

"Good, that's good," said Harry distractedly, turning back to the wall. "Just… keep doing that. I'm triangulating."

Watching Harry out of the corner of her eyes as she exchanged Disarming Charms with Cedric, she saw him continue the slow finger-tracing of the wall. He didn't even have his wand out.

After a minute – during which Cho clipped Cedric with a well-placedspelland he returned the favor, narrowly missing Harry, who stood between them – Harry stepped back from the wall.

"Got it!"

Cho jogged over to him, as did Cedric. The stretch of wall Harry stood in front of looked exactly like the rest of the wall in the corridor, but Harry was looking at it with an acquisitive gleam in his eyes like it contained the lost writings of Merlin.

Who knows, thought Cho. It just might.

Harry dropped his hand to his hip, sliding his wand out of its holster, almost dropping it as he added a flourish at the end. "Need some practice," he muttered sheepishly. He pointed it at the wall, and started chanting under his breath.

"What language is that?" asked Cedric, looking fascinated.

Harry shot him an annoyed look, but didn't stop chanting. His voice rose just a bit, and he jabbed his wand forward.

A brilliant white outline of a door blazed into existence.

Cho saw Harry gape at it for a second, almost like he'd been surprised that it had worked. The light came from behind the wall and bathed the corridor in stark, harsh brightness for a few seconds – and then it was gone.

Harry stood stock-still, his eyes locked on the door, seeing something there, even if it had vanished.

"Harry…?" said Cho.

"Give me a second," he said, unmoving. He licked his lips, leaning forward almost imperceptibly. His eyes flicked over the empty wall like he was reading something.

Cedric stirred at her side, and he motioned to her, a kind of abbreviated twirl of his hand – just go with it.

"Oh!" said Harry. He stepped back, the moment of intense concentration broken. "Of course. Darkness."

"Yeah, of course," said Cedric. "Obvious, when you think about it."

"Darkness," echoed Cho.

Harry looked between them, blinking. "I guess I got caught up in my own little world there, huh?"

"Just a bit," said Cedric.

"Okay, so… the door will let us in if we stand in front of it in complete darkness," said Harry, running a hand through his hair. Cho noticed a gleam of sweat on his forehead. He held his wand aloft and muttered a quick Lumos. "I'll stay here with this light. You two head down the corridor, one of you each way, until you find a door. Close it, lock it with Colloportus, and then come back, putting out every torch on the way."

Cedric nodded and turned away, heading back towards the Hufflepuff Basement. Cho started walking the other way, towards the Great Hall. As she walked, she looked over her shoulder. Harry was staring intently at the wall again.

It took a few minutes to find a door, and another minute to figure out an easy way to extinguish the torches that were bracketed high on the wall. She'd picked up some advanced material hanging out with Harry and Cedric, but Aguamenti was far beyond her level. She settled on transfiguring the torches into iron: slow, but effective.

As she moved from torch to torch, the hallway got darker and darker. She started to get nervous working on the last one, and she kept looking down the hall to the comparatively strong light of Harry's wand. Half comforted and half irritated at her own nervousness in the dark, she finished the transfiguration and watched the torch gutter and die. She stopped herself from running down the hallway to the light, but only just.

Cedric was already there, standing next to Harry. The corridor was bathed in darkness, the circle of Harry's wand-light a sharp contrast to the black emptiness around them.

"Ready?" Harry's voice was excited but low.

"Ready," said Cedric.

Cho nodded wordlessly.

"Stay close," said Harry, and they did. Cho reached out and put a hand on Harry's shoulder, and, after a moment, Cedric did the same. "Nox," whispered Harry.

The darkness was all-consuming and oppressive. Cho couldn't see Harry. She couldn't see the wall. She couldn't see her. She took deep, even breaths.

"Um," said Cedric after a moment.

"Give it a second." Harry's voice was close and quiet. Cho tightened her grip on his shoulder.

Cho found that every sound was magnified. She could hear their breathing; all three of them. She could hear the slight rustle of fabric as Cedric shifted his feet.

"There must be an extra bit," muttered Harry. "A confirmation." Cho heard a dull tapping noise – Harry's wand hitting the wall. His voice dropped to a whisper. "I seek refuge."

Stumbling back against the sudden light, Cho saw the doorway blaze into existence again – only this time, it was accompanied by a low rumble of stone grinding on stone as the door sank into the ground.

Cho felt her hand slip off Harry's shoulder as he walked forward. Cho could see a long hallway in front of them with an arched ceiling lit by a flickering, deep blue light from somewhere within.

Harry was bracketed in the doorway, his wand held in front of him. The blue light coming from the corridor gave his profile an uncanny look as he turned back to them.

"I did warn you," he said, his voice tinged with amusement. "If you stick with me, things are going to get extracurricular."

He stepped forward, and Cho followed him.

Cedric lingered outside. "Harry, we're not going to get trapped in there, right? Just… tell me you've thought this through."

Harry didn't even turn around. "The door is a lot easier to open from this side, Cedric."

Cedric shrugged and stepped through. The door rumbled back up, leaving the three of them free to explore their new surroundings.

The hallway was narrow, with a gently arched ceiling that seemed to be made from a very dark, smooth kind of stone. The light was coming from veins of glass woven through the black stone in winding patterns like tree roots, luminescing a vibrant blue. Cho's eyes were drawn down from the ceiling by the paintings on the wall. There were a dozen or so, evenly spaced along the corridor. They were large, each as big as a person, and the frames weren't wood, but bone, bleach-white and faded.

Harry stepped up to one of the paintings. "Look at this," he said in a slightly awed voice. "That's Hogwarts being built."

Cho peered over his shoulder. The painting was surrealist, with warm, lavish strokes, but Harry was right. The Black Lake loomed in the background, and the castle that stood on the hill was unfinished, the walls uneven heights, the Great Hall without a ceiling, bare to the sky. Small figures stood in the foreground, wands raised, levitating the heavy stones of what would become the base of Gryffindor Tower into position.

Harry stretched out his hand, reaching towards the surface of the painting.

"Harry," said Cedric, his voice worried.

The painting seemed to…sharpen, to Cho's eyes. Instead of paint, the image looked like it was a photograph seen though a murky lens. And then, as Harry's fingers neared the surface, it sharpened further still, until Cho swore she could have been looking through a hole in the air, that the vision in the painting was real and true.

"Harry!" said Cedric, frantically pointing. Cho followed his gesture, and saw that the bones that made up the frame were glowing, faintly, with some internal silver light leaking out through minute cracks.

Harry either didn't hear him, or didn't care. His fingers made contact with the surface of the painting, and before Cho could move, he was jerked off his feet and into the painting, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Cedric swore loudly and jumped forward, but the light had dimmed, the painting already back to being just a painting. "Damn it!" He slapped the painting in frustration.

Cho had her wand out, but she had no idea what to do with it. "Why… the hell did he do that?"

"That idiot," said Cedric with an exasperated shake of his head. "When we get out of here, I'm going to – "

But Cho never found out what Cedric was going to do to Harry; at that moment, the painting glowed for a fraction of a second, and Harry tumbled out. He landed on his feet, more or less, and stumbled, going into an awkward roll. He came up grinning.

"That was bracing," he said, turning back to look at the painting with admiration.

Cedric moved forward and grabbed Harry by the shirt. "What in the bloody hell were you thinking?"

"It's fine," said Harry, brushing him off. "What's your deal? This thing's an ancient version of a Pensieve – see those runes on the corners of the frame?"

"Harry," said Cho, with what she privately considered to be an extraordinary amount of patience. "We're not in your head, thinking your thoughts. I, for one, am grateful for that because I'm sure it would be horrifying if I were, but you keep making these leaps in logic, expecting us to know what you're talking about."

Harry blinked, seeming genuinely confused. "Huh. You know, I think you might have a point."

"No, please, sound more surprised," said Cho.

"Just… tell us the next time you're about to do something crazy," said Cedric.

"Well, I'll try," said Harry. "But no promises."

The three of them spent the next few minutes looking – from a safe distance – at the rest of the paintings.

"Look at this one," said Cedric. "That's got to be one of the first Sortings. See the High Table? Those are the Founders… wow."

"So these are all memories?" said Cho, captivated as she stared at a painting of Rowena Ravenclaw – the dark, wild hair and her famous diadem making her identity obvious – addressing a group of fierce-looking centaurs.

"All of them," said Harry. He stood with his arms crossed in front of a painting of Hogwarts on a dark, rainy night. The castle was in the background, and in the foreground, Hogsmeade was on fire. There were dozens of figures shooting spells through the burning streets. "I don't care what else we find; these are a treasure."

"Historically, if nothing else," said Cedric.

Cho tore herself away from the painting of Ravenclaw. "Come on, let's see what else is here. It's almost two in the morning, we'll have to come back and look at these later."

"Oh, yes, we will," said Harry, that avaricious gleam back in his eyes.

Together, they made their way towards the end of the hallway. It opened into a large, circular chamber. A series of copper lamps hung suspended from the ceiling, which arched up into a dome. The lighting reminded Cho of the Hufflepuff Common Room. The floor was marble, polished to the point of gleaming, and the middle of the room had a large, beautifully intricate compass rose painted into the floor. In each of the cardinal directions, at the point of the arrows, were the respective crests of the four Houses.

The only other ornament in the otherwise bare chamber was the door at the other end. It was circular, heavy, and seemed to be one smooth piece of burnished bronze.

"Wow," said Cedric, his voice echoing through the empty room.

Harry walked forward, his steps clattering on the marble, examining the painted compass in the center of the room.

Cho leaned down and ran her finger over the floor. It came up clean. She wondered how that could be – every aspect, every feeling she got from the room told her that no one had been here in a very long time.

"Look at this," said Harry. He was kneeling at the edge of the compass, inspecting the Slytherin crest painted into the floor. "There are little slots. I think…" He moved closer, his face almost touching the floor. "Cho, come look at this. Am I crazy, or is this a keyhole?"

Cho moved to join him. As she walked forward, her foot hit one of the House crests – the Ravenclaw crest – and it lit up, startling her. She jerked back, stumbling.

Cedric was at her side in a second. "What…?"

"Did you see that? It was all… bright, for a second."

Frowning, Cedric nudged the crest with his foot. Nothing happened.

"Do you think…?" Cedric met Harry's eyes, then Cho's. They didn't even need to say it. Cedric walked around the edge of the compass until he found the Hufflepuff crest. He put a foot on it, and it glowed, the bronze-and-yellow badger gleaming, looking almost alive in the shimmering light.

Harry scratched his head. "Huh." He put his palm down on the Slytherin crest he was kneeling in front of and pressed. Nothing. He got up, moving to the Gryffindor crest and standing on it.

"I'm going to hazard a guess," he said, looking down at the red-gold light, "that we're going to need a few more friends."

"Not just a Slytherin?" said Cedric.

"A Slytherin and one more," said Harry. He pointed to the bronze door across the room. "Four on the compass, and a fifth to stand over there and ask the thing to open." He laughed. "Damn Hufflepuffs and their stupid, annoying teamwork."

"Well," said Cedric, crossing his arms, "I guess we need to make friends with a Slytherin."

"Vaisey?" ventured Cho. Harry and Cedric exchanged a look.

"I don't think so," said Harry. "Too much of a team player."

"He's a decent bloke," said Cedric, "but I'm not sure I'd trust him with this."

"Then I know exactly what Harry and I are doing next Hogsmeade weekend," said Cho.

"What's that?" asked Cedric.

"Going to Daphne Greengrass's lower year friendship and happiness hug club."

"Joy," said Harry.



* * *



Cho wouldn't have thought it possible, but as it turned out, watching Quidditch could be more stressful than playing Quidditch. Watching Cedric go head-to-head with Higgs, dodging Bludgers and outright body-checks from the troll-like Slytherin Chaser line was nerve-racking. She couldn't do anything about it when Mike Vaisey smacked a Bludger that clipped Cedric's leg and sent him crashing into the wall, and that was… stressful.

Harry sat beside her, and like her, his eyes were locked on the game.

"Come on, Cedric, get it together," muttered Harry, his eyes flicking from the scoreboard to Cedric, who was flying with a bit more trepidation after his crash.

"Higgs has really bad reactions," said Cho. "All Cedric needs to do is see it first."

"I hope it's soon. Is it just me, or is the Slytherin team a lot more aggressive this year?"

"It's not just you." Cho paused for a second as the crowd let out a surge of noise as Marcus Flint put another one through the hoops, running up Slytherin's lead even further. "It's us, Harry. Surely you see that? Their Captain looked at the landscape and did the math. 'Take out the other Seeker' is pretty much the only chance they have at the Cup."

"That's sporting," said Harry, grimacing.

"That's Slytherin," she shrugged.

The crowd roared, and Harry and Cho stood as one as Cedric went into an all-out dive. He blew past Higgs, who – just as Cho had predicted – was slow off the mark. Cho's trained eyes picked out the golden ball zipping up from the grass, moving into the middle of the pitch, where the Chasers were scrambling to block the opposing Seeker.

Cedric swept left, drawing a Bludger from Vaisey, then pulled a brutal right turn and corkscrewed up, weaving through the cloud of Chasers. He emerged and hovered over the stadium, his fist clutching the struggling Snitch.

"YES!" Harry threw his hands in the air, and Cho let out a wordless yell, cupping her hands and adding to the crowd noise. They watched as the Hufflepuff team mobbed Cedric, the pile of celebrating Quidditch players gradually floating to the ground.

"I just realized, now you both have a win and I don't," said Harry wistfully as they walked down the steps of the stands, following the crowd as it filed out of the stadium.

"You will soon," said Cho, giving him a nudge with her shoulder. "Gryffindor versus Slytherin is next. You saw how bad Higgs is."

Harry made a noncommittal noise. It was one of the things that Cho alternatively loved and hated about him: he would downplay his own talents most of the time, but every now and then, he'd do something just because he could, and make it obvious that nobody else could, and he'd get that stupid, endearing grin on his face…

"Come on, let's go congratulate Cedric," said Harry, pointing towards the locker rooms. The crowd had spilled out onto the grounds, most making their way back towards the castle, but a fair number sticking around, milling about. Most of those were Hufflepuffs basking in the afterglow.

A great cheer rose from the assembled crowd as the team made its way out of the locker room, still wearing their Quidditch robes and carrying their brooms. Cedric was grinning from ear-to-ear.

Cho rushed forward, Harry by her side, and enveloped Cedric in a hug. She didn't even mind the grass stains. "Great win, Cedric." She pulled back, holding his shoulders. "Are you okay? That looked like a wicked hit when you went into the wall there."

"Ah, he'll be fine," said Harry, punching Cedric's arm lightly. "It would take more than a measly wall to bother old shovel-face here."

"You know what? That doesn't even upset me – I just won a Hogwarts Quidditch game," said Cedric.

"And you did a great job," said a voice from behind them. Zacharias Smith had shouldered his way through the crowd. "Now why don't you tell your friends to shove off and let our House celebrate?"

"Smith," said Cedric, sagging slightly, "this really isn't the time."

"I agree," said Zacharias. "This isn't the time at all for non-Hufflepuffs. Especially non-Hufflepuffs who we're going to be playing soon. I mean, come on."

"Oh, give it a rest," said a seventh-year girl over the general hubbub the crowd. "You're all annoying me."

Cedric made a placating gesture. "Sorry, Tonks. We'll just, ah…"

"It's fine, Cedric," said Harry. He shot Zacharias a glare. "Company's bad anyway. C'mon, Cho."

They made their way to the edge of the crowd, and Cho held her tongue until they were out of earshot. "Smith is such a… a twat," she said, scowling.

Harry grinned. "He's a persistent little twerp, I'll grant him that. I was hoping he might have cooled off over the summer, but I think the fact that we all made Seeker and he failed miserably at Chaser tryouts started things up again."

"Well, I'm not going to take any crap from him this year," said Cho determinedly. "If he keeps sniping at us, I'm going to sic my minions on him."

Harry arched an eyebrow. "You have minions?"

"Yes, I do," she said, tossing her glossy, dark hair over her shoulder. "I'm very popular, you know."

Harry laughed, full-throated and rich. Cho felt her own lips quirking into a smile. As Harry trailed off, he looked up, shielding his eyes against the sun and squinting. "Hey, it's Hedwig. That was quick. I wasn't expecting Fleur to write back in a week."

Cho looked up and saw Harry's gorgeous snowy owl winging her way across the grounds, slowly spiraling down, only to backbeat her wings in a great rush as she approached, landing smoothly and gracefully on Harry's arm.

"You wrote to Fleur?" Cho tilted her head and regarded him as he busied himself checking over Hedwig.

"Mmm," said Harry. He looked up from inspecting Hedwig's plumage, catching Cho's expression. "What? She wrote to me first."

"Un huh," said Cho, her eyebrows climbing her forehead.

"Aw, Hedwig, you've got a twig in your feathers. Poor girl. Here, let me fix that." Harry untied the letter from Hedwig's leg, setting it aside as he sat down and held the owl's wing out.

"It's pretty amazing that she trusts you like that," said Cho. "I mean, that's not exactly standard owl behavior."

"That's because she's a magical owl," said Harry, carefully parting her feathers as Hedwig looked at him with an owl-y, imperious expression. "Seriously. I'm thinking of teaching her to be a Humagus."

Cho sighed. "You're kind of odd, you know that?"

Harry looked up, grinning, opened his mouth to retort –

"Accio letter!"

Zacharias Smith crowed triumphantly as he held up Harry's letter from Fleur. "Well, well, Potter. What have we got here?"

Harry stood up slowly, Hedwig still balanced on his arm. "Smith. I'm going to tell you this once: give that back, right now, or things are going to go badly for you."

"Oh, really?" Zacharias looked over his shoulder at the crowd of Hufflepuffs, only a few of whom were looking in their direction. "The numbers seem to be on my side, for once."

"Not going to help," growled Cho, going for her wand. Harry stilled her, holding out a hand across her body.

Cedric rushed up, breaking through the crowd. "Damn it, Smith. What did I just say?"

Zacharias toyed with the letter. "What? Potter got a letter, I just wanted to look at it for a minute."

Throwing up his hands, Cedric stepped back. "You know what? Fine. I wash my hands of it. Harry, do what you need to do."

Harry smiled slowly, and Smith looked a bit perturbed – but then he squared his shoulders. "What are you gonna do, Potter?"

"Me?" said Harry, acting politely surprised. "Nothing, because you're completely beneath me. Hedwig, on the other hand, doesn't like it when someone messes with her delivery. Hedwig?"

The snowy owl let out a loud barking noise and spread her wings, flying at Zacharias like a missile. Zacharias took a hesitant step back, but didn't seem too intimidated.

Harry, quick as a snake, dropped his hand to his hip and pulled his wand, drawing and casting in one fluid motion. "Engorgio!"

The blue spell hit Hedwig mid-flight, and by the time she pounced on Zacharias, bowling him over, she was the size of a panda. She landed, the blond Hufflepuff trapped beneath her talons, her angry yellow eyes the size of dinner plates.

"HOOT."

"Yes, Hedwig, I quite agree," said Harry, stepping to Hedwig's side, bending over briefly to pluck the letter out of Zacharias's hand. "Smith would be a bit too gamey. I know you're looking for a nice snack after such a long flight, but I think you can do better."

Cho found herself chuckling, and saw that Cedric was placating the crowd of half-angry, half-amused Hufflepuffs attracted by the commotion. She turned to Harry. "I think we've worn out our welcome."

Harry looked up from Zacharias's panicked face, taking in the crowd. "Looks like. I could use a snack. Want to join me, Cho?"

He offered an arm, and Cho took it. They started walking towards the castle, strolling like they hadn't a care in the world. After a minute they heard a great rush of air, and the panda-sized Hedwig swooped over them.

"Oh, right. Sorry, girl," said Harry. He took careful aim (though she presented quite a large target) and hit her with a Reducio. Hedwig hooted in gratitude and beat her wings, flying towards the castle ahead of them.

"Why does it always get weird with you, Harry?" said Cho, somewhat rhetorically. "It's never just 'oh, let's go watch a normal Quidditch match and we'll enjoy it and nothing dramatic or strange will happen.' It's always 'I wonder what's behind this door?' and 'what do you suppose would happen if we both tried to transfigure the same matchstick?' and 'Oh, but I didn't know it would explode, Cho!'"

Harry shrugged, stowing his wand in his holster. "I don't know, but I don't think you're really complaining. You know you wouldn't have it any other way."

Cho felt a smile struggling to slip through her stern expression, and she tightened her grip on Harry's arm. "No, I suppose I wouldn't."



* * *



Navigating the corridors of Hogwarts at night was quickly becoming second nature to Cho. The only downside was that she was running out of clean socks; she ruined a pair each time she padded around in the castle in stocking feet.

She hurried down the stairs from Ravenclaw Tower. This time it wasn't waiting for everyone to clear out that had made her late, but a stubborn piece of homework.

As Cho jogged into the kitchen corridor, she saw that the fruit-bowl portrait was ajar, which meant she wasn't that late after all. Either Harry or Cedric had obviously arrived just a few minutes beforehand.

She climbed through the portrait and started down the stairs, and then hesitated. She heard voices. They floated up the stairway, faint but audible. She paused. She felt a twinge of unease, but she held her position. It was too tempting. And besides, if they didn't want to be overheard, Harry could have easily put up a Muffliato, so it wasn't really spying. (It was.)

"So what did the letter say?" Cedric's voice had a light, teasing tone to it.

"None of your business." Harry's was less amused.

"I think it's cute. You've got a pen pal."

"Shut up."

"A French pen pal."

"I don't get why you're so hung up on – "

"A hot, French pen pal."

"You know, I'm beginning to regret ever befriending you."

"A hot, French, part-Veela pen pal."

"Oh, come on. What difference could that possibly make?"

"You know what they say about Veela, Harry. 'Blonde, stacked, and great in the – "

"If you finish that sentence, I'm hexing you."

Cedric's laughter echoed up the stairs. They didn't talk for a few seconds, and Cho started moving down, thinking dark thoughts about teenage boys, when she froze, hearing her own name.

" – up with you and Cho, anyway?"

"I don't know what you're talking about." Cedric's voice was guarded.

"Un huh. So I'm supposed to believe you stuck to her after our argument for purely honorable reasons?"

"I did, Harry. You were in the wrong, and I was supporting her."

"Asking her for help with Charms homework all the time?"

"She's good at Charms!"

"I think you mean 'She's good at Charms and I like to listen to her explain things while I fantasize about her eyebrows'."

"I never should have told you that. And you took it completely out of context."

Cho felt herself blush. This was getting out of hand. She slammed the portrait shut, hard, and started down the stairs. "Hey guys, I'm here!" she called loudly. She walked into the kitchen. Harry and Cedric were sitting at the little wooden table, doing a very poor job of not looking guilty. "So what did I miss?"

"We were just talking about Charms homework," said Harry. Cedric started coughing. "Butterbeer go down the wrong pipe, there, Cedric?"

Cho slid into a seat at the table, choosing to just plough ahead. "Sorry I'm late. I was working through that Defense essay. Doge's class is starting to get really hard. He had this whole spiel today about integrating the second and third year curriculum and doing Dark creatures and counter-curses at the same time, or something."

"He gave us the same talk," said Harry. "It's an interesting idea, at least. It sounds like he's got a long-term plan."

"I don't know why he's so confident," groused Cho. "It's like he expects to be around for a while."

"Yeah…" said Harry, a faraway expression crossing his face. "Wait." He bolted upright.

"Harry?" Cedric straightened up in his chair. "What is it?"

Harry drew his wand. "Muffliato." He swept it in a broad arc. "Repello Operam. Salvio Hexia."

The air swirled and shimmered with the force of the protective spells. Cho stood, worry creasing her forehead. "What's wrong?"

Reaching into his pocket, Harry pulled out a small mirror. "Sirius Black," he said quietly. He looked up to Cho and Cedric. "Well, if you two were harboring any doubts about throwing in with me, now's the time to bail."

Cho and Cedric exchanged a glance, but didn't move. Harry sat, angling the mirror so they could see it. For a few seconds it was simply a reflection of Harry's face, but then it wavered, and a man appeared. He was darkly handsome, with long, black hair that hung loose to his shoulders.

"Harry?" said the man. His eyes flicked to the sides, taking in the extra people. "Uh. Who are your friends?"

"Cho Chang, Cedric Diggory, meet my godfather, Sirius Black."

Cho gave the man a tentative wave.

"Harry, are you sure this is the best – "

"Get Dumbledore. It's important."

Sirius's expression clouded, and he nodded. The image in the mirror tilted, and Cho saw the ceiling of a luxuriously appointed bedroom.

It only took half a minute, and then the image tilted again, and Cho was looking at the face of one of the most infamous men in the country – Albus Dumbledore. For someone whose name was often spoken in tones of feared reverence, the man looked quite grandfatherly.

"Good evening, Harry," said Dumbledore. He, too, looked to the sides of the image. "And good evening to you, Ms. Chang, Mr. Diggory. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, unusual though the circumstances may be."

"The Defense curse," said Harry without preamble. "It's real, right?"

"Indeed," said Dumbledore, quirking an eyebrow. "Quite an ingenious piece of magic. Hogwarts has been unable to keep a Defense professor for more than a year ever since I denied the position to Tom Riddle."

"Except, now Doge is here for his second year," said Harry. "Why?"

Dumbledore pushed up his half-moon glasses. "It's possible that the curse has weakened over time. It's also possible that Elphias, forced into the professorship as he was, was not seen as a valid target for the curse."

"But there's a simpler explanation, isn't there?" said Harry quietly. "If the curse isn't in effect, it's because Voldemort lifted it."

Dumbledore frowned. "That would imply that Voldemort would have something to gain from Elphias remaining at Hogwarts. I know Elphias quite well, and I cannot imagine that being the case."

Harry licked his lips, and said one word. "Ariana."

The silence in the room was heavy and oppressive. Sirius's eyes went wide, and he spoke for them all:

"Oh, shit."

Chapter 7 – Taking A Break From All Your Worries

Harry Potter was flush with victory and chasing a flush.

He looked over the top of his cards, weighing and measuring. From the other side of the table, Fred Weasley raised an eyebrow.

"One card," said Harry, taking the nine of diamonds out of his hand and sliding it away from him to the middle of the table.

"Bold move," said Fred, raising his voice to carry over the singing.

The Gryffindor Common Room had been taken over by a raucous, sprawling party. Oliver Wood and a crowd of upper years dominated the center of the room. Wood still had his Keeper gear on, and he struck quite a figure with a bottle of firewhiskey in his hand and a scarlet Gryffindor tapestry draped over his shoulders like a gigantic cape. He was leading the room in a rousing chorus of "Jerusalem." Lee Jordan was standing in front of the fireplace with a seventh-year Harry didn't know. The two of them were using their wands to animate fiery outlines of a lion and a snake, making them fight each other (though Jordan's snake was badly overmatched). A crowd of mostly first-years oohed and aahed every time the lion struck a particularly vicious blow, making sparks fly into the air with a poof of flame.

"You idiot, don't throw away a pair trying to get the flush," muttered the Jack of Hearts.

"Shut up, I know what I'm doing," said Harry, glaring at the figure on the card. The Jack just rolled its eyes, doffing its cap sarcastically.

Wizard poker, Harry had found, wasn't so different from the Muggle version – the only difference was that the face cards talked to you. They lied and told the truth about your hand to the rest of the table in equal measure, and sometimes even tried to bluff the other players themselves, throwing their voices, kings pretending to be queens and vice versa.

Angelina dealt Harry a card, sliding it across the table, and Harry picked it up. The Jack of Diamonds looked back at him balefully, before turning its gaze to the edge of the frame, looking sideways.

"Well, don't we make quite a pair?" said the Jack of Diamonds.

"Quite a pair indeed!" laughed the Jack of Hearts.

Harry quickly shoved the cards facedown onto the table, squelching them.

"Get any help?" said Fred, tapping his own cards against his arm.

Harry responded by throwing a handful of silver coins into the middle of the table. "Six Sickles."

"Ooh, he likes his hand, does he?" said Fred.

The singing rose into a swell of sound as Oliver Wood stood on a chair and gestured dramatically. "Bring me my bow… of burning gold…"

"He likes it well enough," said Harry, leaning back in his chair.

"Bring me my chariot of fire…"

The table was an island of calm in a storm of revelry. The other players who'd folded out of the hand already – George, Angelina, Katie, Patrick Aldermaston, and a third year named Kenneth Towler – sat in captivated silence as Fred idly spun a golden Galleon between his fingers.

"Harry, old chap," he said. "You're great on a broom, but you've got a lot to learn about bluffing." He popped his thumb, and flicked the Galleon into the middle of the table. It clanked off the mound of coins already piled high there.

Peeling his cards off the table and glancing at them, Harry looked at Fred, looked at his cards, looked at Fred again, and then tossed them away in disgust.

Fred's grin split his face as he leaned forward to scoop in the pile of bronze and silver coins. He casually flipped his cards over as he did, revealing a pair of fours.

Harry's loud swearing was drowned out by the crowd roaring out the climax of the song, Oliver leading the charge, raising his fist and waving around the bottle like an imaginary weapon.

"Nor shall my SWORD…sleep in my hand!"

"Is it always like this when we win a Quidditch match?" asked Harry as Angelina passed the deck to Katie, who started to deal.

"No, only when we beat Slytherin," said Angelina. "And we haven't beaten them in a while."

"I don't get why it's such a big deal," said Harry, corralling his cards and arranging them into a hand. "I'm a lot more worried about Hufflepuff. Cedric's actually good, you know. Higgs I could beat blindfolded."

"It's not all about the Seekers, Harry," said George reproachfully.

Harry shrugged. "I don't really see Hufflepuff going up one-fifty against you two and Oliver, do you?"

"Two games under his belt and he thinks he's a wily old veteran," said Angelina, her grin softening the words.

The conversation lulled for a moment as they all looked at their cards. Kenneth Towler tossed a few Knuts into the center of the table. "Should have led stronger with a high pair," came a small voice from Kenneth's hand.

"I'm not saying I'm an expert or anything," said Harry as he matched Kenneth's bet. "It's just the impression I got from watching the Hufflepuff game. I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it."

"That's kind of a theme with you, Harry," said Katie, sliding a stack of silver coins into the middle.

"What do you mean?" he asked. The table promptly folded back around to Harry. Kenneth vacillated for a second, but ended up laying down his cards.

"You make snap judgments and then stick to them," said Katie, fiddling with her cards, not looking at him.

"I do?"

"Seems like it," said Katie. "I mean, you wrote off your own House pretty fast."

Harry blinked, looking around the table. No one was looking at Katie like she was crazy. "Um. Where is this coming from? I'm here, aren't I?"

"Barely," said Katie, a real note of frustration threading through her voice. She looked up and met his eyes. "Harry, we have classes and Quidditch together and I think this is the longest conversation I've had with you this year."

"I've been busy," muttered Harry, rolling his shoulders.

"But not too busy to hang out with Diggory and Chang all the time," she said pointedly.

"Yeah, because they're my friends, Katie," he said. He looked around the table. The rest of them were looking back and forth between Harry and Katie like they were watching a tennis match. "You guys think she's barking, right?"

"I don't know, Harry," said Patrick, hesitating. "I mean, we've shared a dorm for almost a year and a half, and I still don't really know anything about you. Aside from, you know, the obvious." He made a vague gesture at Harry's scar.

That put a dark frown on Harry's face. "I don't just go around talking about myself."

"We've noticed," chorused Fred and George.

"Maybe if McLaggen wasn't such a prat…" said Harry.

"He's really not that bad once you get to know him," said Patrick. Again, he hesitated. "But, you know, you have to actually get to know him."

Harry threw up his hands. "What is this, an intervention? I thought we were playing cards."

"Play, then," said Katie, the picture of equanimity. "It's your bet."

Looking at the stack of silver Sickles, Harry scowled. He glanced at his hand, then threw it away.

"Too bad," said Katie, reaching out to take the modest pot. She flipped over her hand, showing queen-high rubbish. "Maybe you shouldn't give up so easily." She gave Harry an eloquent look.

Harry blew out a breath and stood up. "Deal me out for a few hands. I'll just be over there, re-thinking my life choices."

Fred leaned forward, looking like he was about to let loose with a sarcastic quip, and Harry turned and walked away, escaping with a modicum of dignity. He had to skirt around Ron Weasley and few other first year boys who were clustered on the floor. His opponent – Dean something or the other, Harry was pretty sure – was sweating over a move, while Ron seemed to be rather calm. And blindfolded. Harry glanced down at the board as he passed. Ron's pieces were poised on the edges, cleverly supporting each other, giving Dean just enough rope to expand recklessly into the center and hang himself. Harry shook his head.

Alicia intercepted him as he walked through the crowd, pressing a butterbeer into his hands and saying something enthusiastic that was swept up in the general hubbub.

"Yeah, definitely!" said Harry, overly-enthusiastic, the universal signifier for "I didn't hear what you just said." He twisted off the cap and clinked the glass with her, giving Alicia a big smile.

He kept moving through the crowd. Something caught his attention at the edge of the room, and he altered course. Hermione Granger was sitting in one of the big stuffed armchairs that had been pushed up against the walls when the party started. She was reading, her expression one of thoughtful concentration, which was quite at odds with the hat she wore. It was rough-spun, with dangling earflaps and a poofball at the apex, the whole thing a garish mix of red, orange and yellow. What really captured Harry's eye was the Gryffindor lion superimposed on the forehead area – it looked almost like foil, and had a metallic sheen that shimmered as it slowly shook its mane.

"That's a neat bit of work," said Harry, plopping himself down on the arm of a nearby couch, facing her. He gestured vaguely at her head.

Hermione looked up at him from over the top of her book, blinking distractedly. She put a hand to her forehead. "The Overlay Charm? Thank you. I asked Professor Flitwick about it after class yesterday. Just to show support for the team, you understand." She straightened up, smiling brightly. "Although, it's quite a fascinating charm! Did you know it's one of the spells they use in the procedure to animate wizarding photographs?"

"I did, actually," said Harry. "I meant the hat, though."

She tilted her head, frowning. "Oh. Thank you. But I didn't make it. My mum did."

"She must be pretty good at knitting."

"Crochet," corrected Hermione. "A lot of people make that mistake. The difference between knitting and crochet is – "

"Hermione."

She pulled up short. "Yes?"

"I'll give you all the money I have in my pocket if you promise to never tell me the difference between knitting and crochet."

Hermione's face scrunched up into an expression of pained, long-suffering distaste. "I don't understand this place," she said, sighing heavily. "It's a school for magic. And no one is curious or enthusiastic about almost anything."

Harry quirked an eyebrow. "I am. It's just that I only have a certain amount of space in my head to care about things, and I have to prioritize. Some things just have to go into the bin. I've chosen, for instance, not to care whether or not Portsmouth has a cricket club, or what those little plastic things on the ends of shoelaces are called."

Hermione just stared at him. "You're a strange one, Harry Potter."

"So I've been told," he said, unperturbed, settling into the couch. It was quite comfortable, he noticed. Maybe he should spend some time with the Gryffindors. He took a swig of the butterbeer he'd gotten from Alicia.

She snapped her book closed. "What are you doing over here, anyway?"

"What makes you think I'm not just here to enjoy the pleasure of your company?"

"Experience," she said promptly. Then she leaned back, biting her lip. "You're not going to ask me to do your homework for you, are you?"

Harry laughed. "No, I'm okay in that department." His laughter died down. "Damn. You know, that might be the saddest thing I've ever heard."

She waved her hand, brushing it off. "It's nothing I'm not used to. It doesn't bother me."

"And I suppose that makes it better?"

It was her turn to raise an eyebrow. "Doesn't it?"

An eloquent shrug was Harry's only response. He looked around the room, savoring the sights and sounds of the party. There was a bright explosion of flame near the fireplace as Lee Jordan's flame-snake finally bit the dust. The crowd of first-years cheered.

"Not really your type, then?" asked Harry, nodding towards the first-years.

Hermione looked over at them. "Not really," she said a bit wistfully. "I'm not sure I have a type."

"You could do what I did – don't limit yourself to your House and your year when it comes to finding friends."

"Maybe," said Hermione. She cast a sidelong glance at Harry. "I'm not sure I should be taking advice on how to be social from you, though."

Harry groaned. "What is it with people today? Am I really that bad? It's not like I'm some hermit."

"I wouldn't say hermit, exactly," she said, temporizing. "You do seem to be a… very… private kind of person."

"There's nothing wrong with that," said Harry, some of his frustration leaking into his voice. "I don't pry into other peoples' business, and I don't understand why people think it's okay to pry into mine."

"You're famous," shrugged Hermione. "I imagine people feel that should make you outgoing, friendly, and charming."

Scowling, Harry turned to face her. "It's not my job to meet peoples' unrealistic expectations. Besides, most of them don't really care about me, they just want to shake hands with a story. And are you saying I'm not charming?"

"I'm sure I wouldn't know," she said coolly.

"Right," he said, his mood darkening. Because you never bother to talk to people enough to be charming or not, were her unspoken words.

She sank back into her chair, hefting her book again. "Why did you come over here, anyway?"

"I got bluffed off two hands in a row, and I was about to lose a lot of money on the next one because I was steaming about it." Harry took another long pull from the butterbeer bottle.

Hermione paused in the act of opening the book, staring at Harry. "That's remarkably self-aware of you."

Harry laughed, but it was a little hollow. "I spent most of a year being very wrong about myself, and when I figured out what was wrong, it took me a long time to sort out the wrong from the right. Something like that tends to make you really know your own mind."

She closed her eyes, pressing a hand to her face and shaking her head. The earflaps on her homemade hat flapped around. She opened her eyes and gave Harry a flat stare. "In addition to being less of a hermit, you might also work on saying things that make sense."

Finally feeling a bit less out of sorts, Harry grinned. "I'll do my best," he said, crossing his hand over his heart. "Honest." He pushed himself up off the couch. "Good talk, Hermione."

"Mmm," she said, eyes already back on her book.

He turned to go, and then paused. "You know, I haven't seen you at the I.H.C.C. meetings. Might be a good place to start branching out."

She didn't look up. "I refuse to go to a club with such a silly-sounding name. Honestly – 'Ick' – what were they thinking?"

"I'm sure that's the reason you haven't gone," he said, keeping his expression bland. "Still. I'll be at the next one. They have them during Hogsmeade weekends so it's first and second years only. You should go."

"I'll think about it," she said. Harry turned away again, but this time it was Hermione's voice that stopped him.

"They're called aglets."

He frowned. "Huh?"

"The little plastic things on the ends of shoelaces. They're called aglets."

Harry just shook his head. "Know-it-all," he said, but it wasn't unkind.

"Hermit," she replied in the same way.

"Have a good night, Hermione. Don't have too much fun over there in the corner all by yourself."

"Don't be awful," she chided, again, the tone light and almost teasing.

"I'm just saying, it's a party, Hermione."

"Of course it is, Harry," she said archly, the soul of propriety. She gestured at her head. "Why do you think I'm wearing my party hat?"



* * *



Transfiguration Tuesdays. That was what Harry called them. A double period that seemed to expand and dominate the day like a dark cloud.

It wasn't anyone's fault. McGonagall was an excellent teacher, and Harry found her lectures fascinating. It was the practical part of the class that Harry truly dreaded. Harry wasn't quite arrogant enough to consider himself beyond the material, but it was close. All of his experience with magic before Hogwarts had been six highly skilled adults, one of them Albus Dumbledore himself, giving Harry one-on-one, personalized – if sporadic – lessons. One professor teaching a class of dozens simply couldn't compare.

Harry stared down at the beetle on his desk, which was unsuccessfully trying to scurry out of the smooth glass bowl it was trapped in.

McGonagall was lecturing. "The key to a competent animate-to-inanimate transfiguration – besides, of course, the proper wand movement and incantation – is to recognize the similarities already present between the object of your transfiguration and your intended result. As the connections between the two objects become more tenuous, the difficulty of the transfiguration increases. Along the same lines, understanding some of the lesser-understood, deeper, or more esoteric connections can be a powerful tool to assist a competent wizard or witch with a particularly difficult transfiguration."

Harry let out a minute sigh and slumped, ever-so-slightly, in his chair. Hierarchy of Connections, he thought.

Tapping the blackboard with her wand, McGonagall revealed a series of complex, interconnected circles scrawled in chalk and arranged in a vaguely pyramidal shape.

"The forms and levels of these similarities can best be described by what chapter seven of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration calls the Hierarchy of Connections." She tapped the highest circle. "At the highest level, the most important connections are those of purpose. In a conceptual framework, if two objects share a common purpose, transfiguring one to the other has a drastically reduced degree of difficulty. An example: despite their respective sizes, your average witch would have an easier time transfiguring a spear into a needle than a spear into a fence post. The spear and the needle share a similarity of the First Level – that is, their purpose is to pierce."

Cormac McLaggen chose that moment to pipe up. "Does that mean it'd be easy to transfigure Vaisey, there, into a box of rocks?"

Vaisey, slumped over his desk and looking like he was fighting sleep tooth and nail, jerked up and shot McLaggen a glare.

McGonagall fixed Cormac with a stern look, and the blond boy promptly shut up. "Two points from Gryffindor, Mr. McLaggen." Without missing a beat, she turned back to the blackboard. "The most obvious, and second-most important level of the Hierarchy of Connections has to do with relative size, shape, and complexity…"

Harry tuned her out. He couldn't help it. He'd learned this ages ago, if not in such a structured manner. His pre-education was a blessing, but sometimes it was a curse. At least in History of Magic he could get homework done while trapped at his desk, but McGonagall ran a tight ship. He'd tried doing a bit of independent study under the guise of "taking notes" in her class, but she seemed to have a preternatural ability to sniff out such behavior.

As the professor's words washed over him, Harry's thoughts became slow, ponderous, deliberate. What was he going to do about Doge? Dumbledore had advised caution – wait and see, gather information, be circumspect. Harry was more inclined to confront the man directly. It might not have been the most prudent option, but damn it, Harry was itching to do something. The patient part of his mind told him that any kind of direct action would, more likely than not, end up sparking a three-way duel between Doge, the Aurors, and himself on top of the tables in the Great Hall. The larger part thought that scenario was infinitely preferable to waiting.

He was yanked back into focus on the here and now as McGonagall addressed the class directly.

"Now, with those concepts in mind, what similarities might aid you in the transfiguration of your beetle to a button?" Her stern gaze swept over the class, finally landing on Katie, who was sitting to Harry's right.

"Well," said Katie haltingly, "they're both small?" Her voice inched up at the end, making it not quite an answer.

"Indeed," said McGonagall. "Relative size is one of the most important factors in making a rough estimate as to the difficulty of a transfiguration. But, while a large variance of size does present certain challenges, a similarity of size does not, itself, confer any advantage."

Katie slumped in her seat. McGonagall had a way of making even mostly correct answers in her class feel weighty. She didn't hold the class in terrified abeyance like Snape, but she had a way of making you care about being right or wrong.

She turned to the other side of the room, where a boy was raising his hand. "Mister Urquhart?"

The dark-haired Slytherin answered promptly. "They're both shiny, and they're both hard."

"Two points to Slytherin," said the professor. That was another thing about her: she was an equal-opportunity hardass. Harry had seen her in the commentary box at the Gryffindor-Slytherin game, and after a particularly vicious foul, she hadn't made any great secret of being… ardently… partisan. She'd never shown it in class, though. Too much of a professional, reckoned Harry.

"Anyone else?" McGonagall's eyes swept around the class. Her question was met with silence. Harry could practically see Patrick Aldermaston racking his brain. The professor's eyes settled on Harry's. "Mister Potter?"

And that was another thing about the Transfiguration professor. Though she'd never said a word to him about it, Harry suspected that she had a pretty good idea how far ahead of his classmates he was. In fact, thought Harry with a wry grin, she probably had a better idea than Harry himself did: she had the experience to actually quantify Harry's progress, whereas he himself had none.

Harry folded his hands together and leaned back. "The words start with the same letter, both have two syllables, and the syllables share a stressed, then unstressed structure."

There was a moment of silence, and then McLaggen turned to him, scoffing. "You're barmy. How could something like that possibly make a difference?"

Harry was ready with the rejoinder, but McGonagall cut him off. With her eyes. "Four points to Gryffindor. Mister Potter is correct, in fact." She tapped her wand on one of the smaller, lower circles that made up the pyramid. "Linguistic similarly is one of the more subtle, less powerful levels in the hierarchy, but it can be a useful tool in establishing connections where no obvious ones exist."

"But… I mean, if we were speaking, I don't know, French, they wouldn't sound anything like each other," argued McLaggen.

"If we were speaking French, we'd be trying to transfigure mussels into cakepans," said Harry.

McGonagall blinked at him, raising an eyebrow, which for her was the equivalent of an open-mouthed gape. "Indeed." She tapped the blackboard again, and the circle shimmered and expanded. "The nature of an object is determined as much in the mind as it is in its physical existence. See chapter seventeen for more details. Now, take the rest of the period to attempt to transfigure your beetle. Homework will be assigned based on your progress."

The class dissolved into murmuring as people started consulting their books and each other. Harry pulled out his wand and stared at it. The slim piece of holly with a single phoenix feather looked rather innocuous, balanced on his palm like that. But it wasn't. With the right words, it could move mountains. He shifted his glance to the beetle scrabbling furiously against the contoured glass bowl.

"Immobulus," he muttered, and a subtle blue flash enveloped the scurrying insect. It stilled, then froze. Harry picked it up with a bit of distaste. He didn't have any great fear of insects, but, still… gross.

He brought it closer, holding it between his fingers, truly focusing on it. With his wand, he could change the fundamental nature of this creature. Transfiguration was one of those things that seemed to make less sense the more Harry thought about it. Every time Flamel tried to explain the "underlying metaphysics" of the subject, Harry made it about ten minutes into a long lecture about Platonic Forms before pulling out of the conversation with his sanity battered but intact.

Still. Harry held up the frozen beetle to his face, really looking at it. It would soon be a button. It would be alive, and then not. And yet… it would still retain some of its essential beetle-ness. An imprint, an echo, a memory. The button would, in a fashion, remember being a beetle. Harry shook his head. Best get on with it. He was starting to sound like Dumbledore, and that was never a good sign.

He pointed his wand… and then stopped. He tilted his head to the side, looking at the beetle and seeing it as if for the first time. He listened, and he heard it. He smiled – a small, secret smile that was just for him. He waved his wand over the black, shiny insect, his wand making a well-practiced motion for untransfiguration. Slowly at first, and then with a kind of snapping elasticity, the beetle morphed into an unremarkable rock, grey in color, the kind you could find by the bucketful along the shore of the Black Lake.

He laughed, tossing the stone in the air and catching it adroitly. He looked over, and McGonagall was staring at him. He gave her an abbreviated salute – one jouster congratulating another on a match will-tilted.

"Harry?" said Katie from the desk to his left. "What are you doing? Why'd you turn it into a rock instead of a button?"

"I turned it back into a rock," he said.

"Huh?"

Harry shrugged. "If you listen to the beetle, you can kinda hear it, that it didn't quite want to be a beetle."

"That's…" Katie squinted at him. "Um, did you end up getting checked out by Pomfrey after you took that Bludger to the head yesterday?"

"Your button's getting away."

"What? Oh!" Katie reached out and tried to grab her transfigured button, which was currently scuttling away crazily on five-and-a-half beetle legs.

Harry turned his focus back to the rock. He flicked his wand, changing it carefully back into a beetle. Without pausing, he kept the transfiguration going, and in a few seconds he had a small black button sitting on his desk. He scowled at it, then checked his watch. Well.

He spent the next ten minutes going back and forth between beetle and button. It was almost calming. In a way, it felt like doing scales on the wooden flute he'd gotten from Hagrid. There was a certain kind of meditative satisfaction that came from rote practice like this. But even so…

With fifteen long minutes left in the class, Harry set the button aside and turned to the glass bowl itself. Might as well get in some inanimate-to-inanimate practice. He cracked his knuckles, centering the bowl on the desk, studying it. The glass was a fine piece of work – the material was thin and clear, spotless. The very top was frosted, with an etched band of ornamental vines that circled the bowl. So. A container, but also elegant, simple, and designed with an eye for aesthetics.

Harry smirked, and waved his wand. Slowly – and then quickly, with a somewhat worrying flash of light and smoke, the glass bowl morphed into a shiny, oblong, wobbly doll. It was one of those matryoshka dolls that opened into smaller copies of themselves. It was mostly red, with a painted white caricature of a face.

Bemused, he picked up the doll. It felt heavy. The painted face looked at him with a kind of surprised yet mocking expression.

"Well, I guess that's ornamental. Kind of stretching the definition of a container, though." He twisted and turned the doll in his hands, studying it. By all accounts, it was a very good transfiguration. And yet something felt… off. With only a bit of trepidation, he twisted it, the upper half coming loose in his hands.

Inside was a smaller copy of the doll. Harry set the two halves aside and hefted the smaller doll. The face wasn't quite as perfect; the paint was blurry instead of crisp and clean. He twisted that one apart. The next one – this one the size of his fist – had a blob of paint for a face.

With a growing sense of apprehension, Harry started to take the dolls apart at a faster pace. After a few seconds his desk was littered with doll halves. He had to carefully twist apart a doll that was about the size of a battery.

A few moments later, Harry's hands were trembling as he held, between his fingers, a doll only a little larger than a grain of rice. He let out a shaky laugh. I mean, it's not like it's dolls all the way down… right? He thought back to his spell – it had been sloppy; he realized that now. Vague. Imprecise. He'd been too focused on the conceptual part of the bowl, and too fuzzy about the precise outcome that would connect to those anchor points.

His hand shook a bit as he worked his fingernail into the crease in the middle of the smallest doll. As soon as he cracked the shell, he knew he'd made a mistake.

There was a noise like the sound ice cubes made when you poured water over them, but much louder. The temperature in the room dropped by about twenty degrees.

"Mister Potter!" McGonagall was suddenly just there. She swept her wand in a tight downward arc, and the dozens of doll-pieces, including the one in Harry's hand, vanished with a pop.

He looked up. The entire class, to a person, was looking at him.

"Er, could everyone stop staring at me? It's giving me the chills." He plastered a weak, halfhearted grin on his face as he looked around hopefully, searching for a bit of sympathetic laughter. Even a giggle would do. No one was biting. Katie Bell had her face in her palm. Ah, well.

McGonagall's lips were a hard, horizontal line. "Detention."



* * *



"I mean, yes, it wasn't exactly brilliant, but it wasn't dangerous or anything," said Harry. "It's not like they would have exploded or something. The really bad stuff happens if you leave the thing at an intermediate stage, when you mess up the beginning. I didn't do that."

Cho didn't look up. "Mmm hmm."

"I didn't even mind the detention. I mean, sure, have to maintain an iron grip on your classroom, can't let the inmates run the asylum, et cetera. But everyone's acting like I was juggling chainsaws or something."

"Chainsaws, right," said Cho, still not looking up.

"Left turn," said Harry, tightening his grip on her shoulder as he navigated through the hallways. Cho didn't look up from her magazine even as they walked and turned a corner.

It was Saturday. Harry had wanted to go to the I.H.C.C. meeting, and Cho had wanted to stay in Ravenclaw Tower and keep reading the new issue of Witch Broomstick, and this was the compromise they'd worked out.

Harry nudged Cho to the side of the hallway, maneuvering them out of the way of a confused-looking first year. "The worst part, though, was the seventeen-minute lecture from Hermione Granger. I know it was seventeen minutes because I timed it. It really, really seemed longer than that."

"Yeah," said Cho, still deeply involved with the magazine.

"It would have gone on longer, but it kind of turned into an interrogation about what exactly I did, and the magical theory of heat transference, and after a while I was just impressed at her lung capacity."

Cho just made a kind of vague noise as she turned a page. Harry scowled at her.

"Anyway, the whole thing was a disaster. I had to sort and polish all the school brooms. It took hours. And then Zacharias Smith came by trying to get a rise out of me and I turned his head into an octopus." No reaction from Cho. "This whole school thing isn't working out, so I think after the I.H.C.C. meeting I'm going to go run away and join the centaurs. Or transfigure myself into a Pumpkin Person. Or become a florist."

"That's nice," said Cho.

Harry rolled his eyes. "Step," he said, and Cho took her eyes off the magazine just long enough to compensate for the stone staircase as they descended to the third floor.

"Harry, look at this!" said Cho, apropos of nothing that he could tell. She seized his arm, dragging them to a stop and gesturing frantically to the magazine.

He glanced at the article. The title, in bright, bold letters, read "Twenty Under Twenty: Profiling the Next Wave of International Quidditch Talent". The header photo was a girl in her late teens – dark hair, dark eyes, and a trim, athletic figure. He recognized her as Tatiana Ionescu, the Transylvanian Terror, who'd recently made waves by setting a single-game scoring record against Wales in one of the qualifiers leading up to the Quidditch World Cup. She was already considered one of the best Chasers in the world, and she was only eighteen. For some reason, Harry found his eyes lingering on the picture.

"Um, what about it?" he said. "I don't need an article to tell me Ionescu's really good."

"Not her, Harry. Look, look!" She jabbed her finger down at the article itself. Harry followed her finger down the rankings, all the way to number three.

"Krum, huh?" said Harry, his eyebrows lifting. "Guess he was pretty good after all."

Cho was practically bouncing with excitement. "Good? Good? Harry, you never saw him fly. He's absolutely brilliant. It says here he might make the Bulgarian national team. And he's only a couple years older than us!" She stopped dead, and got a dreamy, faraway look on her face.

Last year, on Cedric's advice, Harry had taken Cho to the Mirror of Erised to explain his memory problems. As with Cedric, Harry hadn't asked what she'd seen. It was deeply personal, after all. But, seeing her beatific expression at the thought of someone young and talented making their country's national team, Harry had a pretty good guess.

"I should write him a letter congratulating him," said Cho. "That's so cool that he got an article written about him."

"…and nineteen other people," said Harry.

Cho blew right past that one, carefully folding the magazine closed and starting to walk again. Then she came to a dead stop, and made a sound that would, in all fairness, have to be called a squee. "What if he makes the national team and Bulgaria actually makes it to the finals because the finals are here this time and we could see him play and I think that would be the best thing ever, and – "

"Breathe, Cho," said Harry.

She did so. She didn't lose the giddy expression or the bounce in her step as they started moving again, though.

They walked a while in silence. The hallway opened up into the main third floor corridor, which had tall, slim windows studding the left side. Harry looked out and saw swirling snow, a whole world of it.

"I don't envy Cedric today," he said. "I mean, yay Honeydukes and everything, but it looks brutal out there."

"Yeah," said Cho distantly. Harry turned to look at her, expecting to see her head buried in the magazine again, but instead, she was staring out the same window with a troubled look on her face.

He nudged her with his shoulder. "What's up?"

"I'm worried about Doge," she admitted. She looked over to Harry, her dark eyes conveying more than a sense of mere worry.

Harry dropped his hand to his hip and drew his wand from its holster. It was becoming almost second nature, now. He flicked it. "Muffliato. Cho, we shouldn't talk about this here. Invisible Aurors, remember?"

"It just…" she bit her lip. "It just creeps me out. Sitting in his class, knowing he could have some connection to You-Know-You. It's scary."

Harry leaned against the wall, crossing his arms and facing her. "Believe me, I know how you feel. I think we should be doing something. But you know why we can't – the fact that he's being watched, and the fact that I'm already on thin ice with the Ministry…"

"I know," said Cho.

"Dumbledore has known him for almost a century," said Harry. "Sirius and Remus fought against Voldemort with him. They all say the same thing – he's not the nicest bloke around, but he's no Death Eater."

"And all that stuff about his wife? Dumbledore's sister?"

Harry shrugged. "Aberforth's going to visit St. Mungo's over Christmas, check in on her. They'd do it sooner, but no one else in our little group really has reliable access to the place."

"I don't like this, Harry."

"Yeah, join the club." He nudged her with his shoulder. "Come on, we're going to be late."

She sighed, but let herself be prodded into motion. "I don't get why you keep dragging us back to these things."

"It's the only way we're ever going to get to know a Slytherin enough to find someone we can trust with the… thing." Out of range of the voice-muffling spell, Harry was mindful of his words.

Cho shook her head. "Those first-years are just… nasty. That boy, Theo, gives me the creeps. And that Malfoy boy is the biggest loudmouth ever. He should start a club for blond knob-heads with Smith and McLaggen."

Harry chuckled. He had to give her that one. "Which one's Malfoy?"

Looking at him askance, Cho almost tripped over her feet as they rounded another corner. "The one you yelled at on the train?"

"Oh, right. Drake Malloy. Yeah, he's annoying."

"Malfoy, Harry."

"Whatever. What about Tracey and Daphne? Tracey seems sharp, and Daphne's really nice. She keeps bringing ice cream, anyway, which is kind of the same thing."

"Tracey is a tiny ball of pent-up anger and some pretty clever insults. She made Marietta cry last time."

"Well, Marietta shouldn't have made a crack about her height. What about Daphne? I like her."

Cho slowed down. They were approaching the meeting place – a repurposed classroom on the third floor. "Daphne…" Cho rubbed her chin thoughtfully. "Something's off about her. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something isn't right about that girl."

"You're sure it doesn't have anything to do with her kind of… intruding on your territory?"

That brought Cho up short. "What's that supposed to mean?"

Harry shrugged. "You're pretty popular in our year, and she's following in your footsteps a bit. Maybe it's just one of those things where two people who are really alike rub each other the wrong way."

Cho looked at him, head cocked and hand on her hip, in such a perfect posture of reproach that he burst out laughing. "That's not it."

"Whatever you say." He grinned at her.

And then they were there. Harry could hear the murmur of voices even before he touched the door. He opened it into what only vaguely resembled the disused classroom it had been originally. The room was lit by dozens of cheerful little paper lanterns, and instead of desks, there was a loose circle of chairs. Beyond those, bracketing the walls, were large, wooden tables piled high with a variety of snack foods.

It was obvious that Harry and Cho were some of the last arrivals. The room was packed. Harry was actually starting to learn some names, and he made himself go through them as he scanned the crowd.

Zacharias Smith was there, with his two cohorts – Harry tentatively identified them as Summers and Stebbins – deep in conversation with the Slytherins from Harry's year: Vaisey, Urquhart, and Bletchley. I'll just avoid that side of the room, thought Harry. Near the center were a gaggle of first year girls. The ones in Harry's House he'd made a valiant effort to memorize, and thus was able to identify Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. The others Harry was less sure of. The Ravenclaw he pegged as Lisa, and two Hufflepuffs were Susan and Hannah, though if pressed, he couldn't exactly remember which one was which. Cho left Harry's side and went to join them.

A big crowd of boys were clustered around Ron Weasley at one end of the room. Here, Harry could only do last names, but they came easily enough: Finnigan, Thomas, Boot, Goldstein, Finch-Fletchley, Hopkins, Macmillan. Ron was spinning something in his hands, and with a flick, it shot towards the floor. The yellow, spinning yo-yo let out a gruff, garbled yell.

"Watch yer aim, yeh plonker! I nearly hit the floor!"

The group of boys laughed. They had that eager, insane laughter that comes from a group bouncing off the same joke until it takes on a life of its own and appears utterly obtuse to outsiders.

Ron beamed. "Brilliant, aren't they? Fred and George invented them. Screaming Yo-Yos." He was chuckling so hard that his voice came out half-hitched, talking around the laughter.

"What's wrong with yer voice, yeh ponce? Yeh sound like yer gargling a bag of horse cocks!"

The group of boys roared with laughter. Harry was torn between wanting to go join the fun, and never wanting to talk to any of them, ever.

He cut the Gordian Knot by walking across the room to the windows, where Hermione, Tracey, and Padma Patil were arguing spell theory. Harry stood next to Hermione, trying to follow along.

"…if you take into account the proper Arithmancy calculations…"

"…only an idiot would derive linguistic components first…"

"… have to pay attention to the relevant subsections of the text…"

It was difficult to follow the thread, since all three of them were talking at the same time.

Shaking his head, he drifted away from the trio, resolving to keep an eye on them in the future, on the off-chance that they ended up inventing magical space travel or developing a Grand Unified Theory of magic or something.

A hand tapped him on the shoulder.

"Harry?" He turned, and there was Daphne Greengrass. She was wearing jeans and a cream-colored jumper festooned with green Christmas trees. It was so large on her that she was practically swimming in it. "I just wanted to thank you for coming." She glanced down bashfully, then looked back up. "I know you don't like it, but the fact that people were curious about you probably helped get us off the ground. So anyway, thanks."

"You're welcome, I guess," said Harry. He cracked a smile. "Though, as has recently been pointed out to me, I'm not sure I was really doing you any favors. I guess I've been a little…reclusive… lately."

"Part of your appeal," said Daphne immediately, and brightly.

Harry – smartly, he thought – chose to just wave at that one, rather than take a swing at it. "So, any activities this time, or just a mix and mingle?"

"Mix and mingle, I think," said Daphne, turning her head and glancing around the room. "Honestly, all I was trying to do was get people talking to each other, and as long as they're doing that, and not starting anything – "

Apparently Daphne had been tempting fate: even as she spoke, an angry cry arose from the group of boys in the middle of the room.

"You take that back!" That was Thomas – he, Finnigan, and Ron Weasley had formed a phalanx in front of Blaise Zabini.

"All I said was that the Charm work wasn't that good," said Zabini. "It's not like I called your brothers morons."

"Well, you implied it," said Ron.

"Yeah," said Finnigan. "It was all over your face. I could tell before you even came over that you were going to say something nasty."

Zabini just rolled his eyes. "Have you ever heard the phrase 'poisoning the well'?"

"No," said Thomas, scowling. "But it sounds like just the kind of thing a Slytherin would do."

Breaking into a lopsided smile, Zabini took a step back and crossed his arms. "I could explain to you why that's a hilariously ironic statement, but it would take too long."

Harry chuckled even as Daphne moved forward, interjecting herself between the boys.

"Out," said Daphne. She pointed at Thomas.

"Come on," he said angrily. "Zabini was insulting Fred and George!"

"Don't care," said Daphne. Her tone was brusque. "You know the rules. No House mentions."

Thomas grumbled, but he went. When Daphne Greengrass dropped her niceness, she was a force.

Huh. That's interesting. Harry retreated a bit from the aftermath of the altercation, thinking. It was just an idle thought, but it seemed to linger: she changed gears pretty quick there. Cho had said she'd felt something off about Daphne. And just then, Harry felt an inkling of the same thing.

"Sorry about that," said Daphne. She brushed back her long, dark hair as she moved back over to where they'd been standing before. She was all smiles again. "I guess we haven't quite worked out all the kinks yet."

"So it would seem," replied Harry blandly. Damn it, now he was reading too much into every word she said.

"Anyway, what were we talking about?"

"The club," said Harry. "How it's developing. Expectations versus reality."

Daphne gave him a quizzical look. "It's doing what I wanted. People are just talking to each other for the most part, and they're not bringing Houses into everything. It's a start."

"Are you getting anything out of it yourself?"

That seemed to stump her. "I… don't know?"

Progress. It wasn't exactly an elegant strategy, but keeping a steady stream of questions seemed to be putting her on the back foot. He was aware that he was working out a bit of his frustration with his inaction over the Doge situation – he was pressing Daphne, because he couldn't progress elsewhere. But damn it, Cho's comment was now securely lodged in his brain. And, like a piece of food stuck in his teeth, he couldn't stop picking at it. There was something about this girl.

"Any siblings, Daphne?"

Curiously, the abrupt change of topic didn't seem to throw her at all. "One. My half-sister, Astoria." Daphne smiled. "She's sweet. I always think of her as a baby, but she'll be at Hogwarts herself in a couple years."

"Hmm." They were in their own little pocket of space, the crowd of other first and second years milling around the center of the room, and the two of them up against the windows. Harry leaned back against the wall, and after a second, Daphne copied him. "I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I'd had a sister."

And again, his expectations were confounded. Harry saw no reason she'd react to that, but Daphne looked over at him, her expression getting cold for a second before fading into a kind of polite curiosity. "Well," she said, "I suppose that's understandable."

"Yeah, the whole orphan thing does tend to make one curious. Unanswered questions, and all that," said Harry. And she smiled at that. Any normal girl would smack down his insensitivity. Okay, time for a different strategy. He lapsed into silence. Let her lead the conversation for a change.

Daphne looked back over the crowd, not saying anything for a long moment. When she did, it was very quiet, like the words had slipped, under protest, from her mouth. "Sometimes," she said, flicking her sea-green eyes to Harry's, "the answered question is worse than the unanswered one."

Harry just looked at her. He held her gaze, and she didn't break it. He wasn't even aware that neither of them had said anything for several seconds.

"Daphne." Tracey's voice broke the spell, and Harry shook his head, clearing it. "We just ran out of crisps. I don't care, but you might want to grab some more." She spared Harry a quick look. "Potter."

"Davis," said Harry evenly. He levered himself up from his lean. "I should go."

"Whatever, Potter," said Tracey.

Harry moved away, but as he did, he looked over his shoulder. Daphne was looking at him. He felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise. What was with that girl?

He was so distracted that he almost ran down Cho. "Oh!" she said, grabbing his arm to steady herself. "Did you see the carriages start to come back from Hogsmeade? We should go meet Cedric."

"How do you know he'll be in the first few?"

"Cedric wouldn't make me wait for sweets," said Cho airily.

"Right." Harry grinned at her, and they walked out of the room. Harry felt no need to say goodbye to anyone there, and he felt a twinge of guilt about it. And then, a twinge of anger at feeling guilty. He took those twinges and told them to get stuffed, opting to focus on more important things.

"So, there's definitely something up with Daphne," he said as they trudged down a staircase, nearing the Great Hall.

"I told you," said Cho. "Nobody's that nice."

"That's not quite it," he said. "She's…" he felt around the issue, poking and prodding, thinking out loud. "You know last year, when sometimes I would say something and it just didn't fit, because of my… you know, thing?"

Cho looked at him sideways. "Harry, I don't think Daphne Greengrass had your kind of upbringing."

Harry just shrugged. "I don't either, but the way she acts kind of reminds of that."

They entered the Great Hall – it was mostly empty, with a stream of very cold and snowed-on upper years making their way in from the Entrance Hall.

"I don't know why you're obsessing about it," said Cho. "There are other Slytherins. Maybe we get to know Vaisey a little better."

"No," said Harry. "Greengrass. There's something about her."

"If you say so."

Their conversation was interrupted by Cedric yelling at them happily from across the room. "Hey!" He jogged over to them, hefting a few large bags. "I'll be really glad when you two can go to Hogsmeade, if only because you can buy your own damn sweets." He passed off one of the bags to Cho, who wasted no time before diving into it.

"So…" said Cedric. "Good meeting?"

Harry held up his hand and waggled it side-to-side. "Decent. At least they stopped the introductions and group activities. Now it's basically just a bunch of lower years hanging out with a ban on mentioning House names or anything related to Houses."

Cedric had a smile on his face as he watched Cho sorting her sugar quills by size. He looked back to Harry. "Any progress on Operation Befriend-A-Slytherin?"

"Daphne Greengrass," said Harry promptly.

Cho looked like she wanted to interject something there, but her mouth was full, so she just glared at him.

"That's… unexpected," said Cedric, rubbing his jaw. "Can't say I know her that well."

"I mean to," said Harry. "If only because I need a distraction from all the brick walls I keep running into with all my other projects."

"Sounds like you could use a bit of a break," said Cedric.

"Maybe. What did you have in mind?"

"Well, I was thinking…" he started to look almost nervous, which was an unusual expression for Cedric. "Cho and I are both going home for Christmas this year, and you'll probably go mad being stuck here by yourself, so… want to come to my house? I already ran it by my parents. They were thrilled, obviously." His face soured at that last bit.

"Huh," said Harry, blinking. "That actually sounds like fun."

"You'll probably have to grin and bear it with my dad a bit," he said, "but I can promise you good food, and we can always trek over to the Weasleys for pickup Quidditch if we get bored."

"Cedric, mate," said Harry, snagging a sugar quill from Cho's pile before she could bat his hand away. "That sounds brilliant."



* * *



The Hogwarts Express was curiously quiet on the ride back for the Christmas hols. It was a bit ominous to walk through the carriages and see the majority of the students huddled up like survivors of some catastrophe. That is, until Harry remembered the semi-secret upper years pre-Christmas party that Fred and George had said led to the train home being called the "Hangover Express."

Speaking of which…

Harry tapped on the glass of a compartment near the back of the train.

"Bloody hell," croaked a voice. "Come in or don't, but stop making that noise."

Harry slid the door open, entered, and wasn't too gentle closing it. "Afternoon, gentlemen. Feeling a bit under the weather?"

Fred was sprawled on one of the seats, his arm dangling loosely on the floor and his head covered by a pillow. "Bloody hell," he repeated, whispering it this time.

George wasn't in any better shape: he had his head pressed up against the window and his eyes closed, and looked like he was trying very hard not to move at all.

"So," said Harry. "Good party?"

"It was fun until we got kicked out for being third years," said George. "They made us do shots before they gave us the boot. I'm going to die, I think."

"Can I get you guys anything? Maybe a nice warm butterbeer?"

"Oh god," said Fred, curling up into a ball and holding his stomach.

"Get out of here, Harry," said George, still with his eyes closed, as he pressed his face into the cool glass of the window. "All I want right now is a new skull."

"Right then," said Harry, moving to leave. "Cedric and I might come over during the break – sound good?"

"That's fine," said Fred. "Although instead of doing that later, how about you kill me, right now?"

Harry laughed and opened the door – though he was a bit more careful about not slamming it this time.

He made his way back to the compartment he shared with Cho and Cedric. His two friends were playing a game of Exploding Snap, the cards balanced on their legs as they stretched out on the seats.

"So, yeah," said Harry. "Cedric, I'm going to recommend that you either skip that big party when you can go next year, or invest in a really good Hangover-Cure Potion."

"The second one, for sure," said Cedric, playing a card. "I've been looking for a challenge in Potions."

"Speaking of challenges," said Cho, scooting over a bit to let Harry sit, "any progress with the Refuge? You said you were going to have another go at it last night."

"None," said Harry, scrubbing a hand through his hair. "I'm starting to think that I jumped the gun a bit being all self-congratulatory for finding it so easily. I mean, those memory-portrait things are interesting, but the really good stuff has to be past that bronze door. Honestly, all we did was get a foot in the entryway."

Cedric played another card. "You still think we're going to need some kind of keys?"

"Yeah," said Harry. "I've spent hours looking at those slots in the floor on each House crest. Magical keys, four of them. In addition to two more trustworthy people we've got to bring into this whole mess." He sighed. "And this is just one of the four rooms. I'm starting to really understand what my mum was on about. She studied this stuff for years and didn't even find one of them."

"We've got time," Cho pointed out.

"If we're lucky," said Harry. "But I wouldn't count on it." He looked out the window. Somewhere out there, Peter Pettigrew was helping Voldemort claw his way back to life. Every day, they planned and plotted, and Harry had no idea where they were, what they were doing, or how long it would be before he found out in some unpleasant way. He shuddered.

And then jumped at a tapping on the window.

"Hedwig!" Cho slid off her seat, upsetting the cards, and went to the window, propping it open. The snowy owl, who was winging her way alongside the train, flew through the window and onto Harry's shoulder in a flurry of feathers and wing-beats.

The owl gave Harry an affectionate nip on the ear, and then stuck out her leg. The letter she had tied to it was rolled up neatly, but Harry could see his own name on the outside written in a familiar, elegant hand. He untied it and started to unroll it.

"What is this, number four?" said Cedric, his voice laced with amusement.

"Doesn't this girl have her own friends?" muttered Cho.

Harry could have pointed out the fact that she'd sent off her own letter to Krum a few days ago, but elected to read, instead.

Harry,

Your French is improving. The last letter was almost legible. I enjoyed the story, very much, of your thrilling victory against the villainous Slytherin House. Your storytelling is much better than your French, even if I do not quite believe that Slytherin employs trolls riding wooden logs for Beaters, and that their Seeker is a dragon Animagus who forgoes a broom entirely.

If you could do me a favor, though – how is my English? I've been studying hard, and not just so we can talk (although I would have, regardless.) In fact, I have secured an exciting opportunity this summer – I will have a chance, for six weeks, to study at the feet of one of the great wandmakers of the world - Garrick Ollivander himself!

You asked me in your last letter, why I strive for this – and it is hard to put in to words. When I hold my own wand, it astounds me that a single hair from my grandmother and a bit of wood can be such a profound tool. The desire to make something of myself, to create objects with my hands that can carry my greatness into the world, is something I desperately hope for.

I look forward to explaining more, in person, if you are able. You've told me little of your relatives, but if they're amenable, I hope you can visit me during my time in your country.

Wishing you a joyeux Noël,

Your friend,

-Fleur

Harry folded the letter and slipped it into his jacket, a warm smile slowly spreading on his face.

"Anything interesting?" asked Cedric.

"Just a few summer plans," said Harry.

Author's note:

This one took a little longer than usual, but there was a very good reason for that: a big chunk of the time I usually dedicate to writing went to taking a hard look at the long-term outline I have for this fic. I think folks will be happier in the long run, as I've tightened up several important plot points.

Along those lines, I want to extend a special thanks to MattSilver and Taure for helping me brainstorm and offering some incredibly useful feedback.

MattSilver is the author of Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma, and if you're a fan of the sublimely sophomoric style of humor in A Black Comedy, do yourself a favor and check out his most recent work, Blackman, a Batman/HP fusion with Sirius Black as a Batman-style vigilante. It's funny as hell. Currently, it's exclusively available in the WbA section of DLP.

Taure has written several HP fics, including one of my personal favorites when it comes to canon-compliant tone, The One He Feared. If you're in the mood for something with Original Flavor that's not canon rehash, give this one a look.



Thanks to everyone who's commented and/or followed this story as it grows. As always, a review on your way out would be much appreciated.





9. Chapter 9

Author's note: Because I know how hard it is to come back to a story after a month and remember every little plot point, I've written a short summary for the previous chapters. It can be found in my profile.

Chapter 8 – Ēthos Anthrōpōi Daimōn

The Diggory household was quiet and cold. It was, reflected Harry, better than the Dursleys' natural state of loud and cold, but it wasn't ideal. Cedric's parents had been nothing but polite, but one couldn't exactly call them warm. Cedric had said they'd welcome a visit from Harry Potter – and that turned out to be literally true.

Harry stood at the window and looked out across a winter wonderland – Ottery St. Catchpole looked almost unbearably quaint with holiday decorations and a light dusting of snow.

There was a crackling sound behind him, and Cedric cursed. Harry turned and saw him staring mournfully at the cauldron, the pale blue liquid inside boiling merrily.

"Aren't potions supposed to boil?" asked Harry.

"Not a Cooling Concoction," said Cedric disgustedly as he heaved the cauldron off the fire. He tapped his wand against the small stove and the flames died.

Harry stepped away from the window and glanced around the room as Cedric cleaned up, muttering to himself and taking out his frustration on the wooden cutting board as he scrubbed it down. Cedric's room was quite large, and unlike any bedroom Harry had been in – not that he'd been in many – Cedric had shuffled off such trivial objects as his bed, desk, and bookshelf to one side of the room, eschewing them for a small but professional-looking Potions station.

"What's the point of a Cooling Concoction?" asked Harry, moving to the cauldron and craning his neck as he stared down into it. The bubbling had faded, and the liquid, once a crystalline blue, was now slightly cloudy. "I mean, you can just cast a Cooling Charm. Seems a bit easier."

"Well," said Cedric, ticking points off his fingers, "you can put a few drops in a drink and cool it off without watering it down, you can use it like perfume on a hot day, stuff like that. Kids under seventeen use it all the time. When you can't use magic outside of school, potions take up a lot of the slack." He'd finished rinsing off the cutting board, and was now drying it meticulously with a tea towel. "Of course, the real value is in high-complexity potions, ones that are too finicky to use magic on directly. It's an essential ingredient for a lot of the really powerful, post-N.E.W.T. stuff Snape talks about sometimes. But that's really advanced. Potions as reagents for other potions isn't even discussed until after O.W.L.s."

"Huh," said Harry. Feeling his response wasn't quite proportional to Cedric's enthusiastic outpouring, he pressed on. "Going a bit overboard, aren't you?" Cedric glanced at him, and Harry gestured at the workstation.

"Not really," said Cedric. He shrugged. "Potions aren't just about following the instructions. There's a fair bit of improvising and thinking on your feet that goes into them – kind of like what you're always going on about with spellcasting. But to do that, you need to know exactly what you started with, what you put in, and what you have now. No contamination." He finished drying the cutting board and set it aside, starting to work on the brass stirring implements he'd set out in a row.

"I wasn't talking about you doing your best house-elf impression," said Harry, exasperated. "I mean in general. The whole thing. Don't you want to, you know, have some fun over the break?"

Cedric looked honestly confused. "This is fun."

Rolling his eyes, Harry started to drag Cedric out the room and down the stairs. "Let me introduce you to this new thing, it's called 'going outside.' Seriously, I'm starting to go crazy."

The living room of the Diggory household resembled nothing so much as a shrine to Cedric. The wall above the Floo connection was dotted with family photos, Cedric front and center in each one. The three Diggorys at the beach, or a Quidditch match, or in front of the Ministry of Magic, with Amos Diggory holding a plaque of some kind and grinning like a loon. In almost every one, Cedric's dad had his hand on his son's shoulder. It was a timeless, honest, familial gesture that nonetheless rubbed Harry the wrong way every time he walked through the room. Something about it seemed possessive, almost as if to convey the idea that all your victories and all your talents flow through me.

Or it could mean nothing. Harry couldn't exactly call himself an expert on family.

"So, what do you want to do?" asked Cedric, striding through the living room and plopping himself down on a plush leather couch.

"Anything that involves us actually going outside," said Harry, hauling Cedric by the arm up off the couch.

"Okay, mum," groused Cedric. "Honestly, we'll be back at Hogwarts and morning Quidditch practice in freezing rain soon enough. Don't see why you're so hung up on it now."

"I'm restless, is all," said Harry. "Come on, there's got to be something we can do outside."

"Well," said Cedric, gazing doubtfully out the window, "I suppose we could go fishing. Maybe see if the Weasleys would be up for that pickup Quidditch game later in the afternoon."

"Yes, excellent, let's do that," said Harry, and then his mind caught up with his mouth. "Wait. Fishing?"

"Oh, sure," said Cedric. "Loads of fun. Do it all the time during the summer. It'll be like that, only colder."

"Okay, then." Harry moved towards the door, grabbing his coat. "Where do you keep your fishing rods?"

Cedric laughed. "Fishing rods? Harry, we're not Muggles."

"So what do you use?" Harry scratched his chin. "Accio trout doesn't seem too sporting."

"You'll see," said Cedric. He cupped his hand and called into the kitchen. "Dad! Harry and I are going down to the river to go fishing. Can you come set us up?"

Amos Diggory called out a hearty, "Of course, Ced!"

"Why do we need your dad's help?" asked Harry. "Not that I mind him coming," he added quickly.

Cedric looked at him askance, the speed of Harry's amendment negating its message. "We can't use magic outside of school." He raised an eyebrow. "Or, most of us can't. I don't suppose that's something you neglected to tell me you could do?"

"I wish," said Harry, pulling his wand from its holster and staring at it glumly. It was the first time since he'd gotten his wand all those years ago that he hadn't been allowed to cast spells for an extended period of time. It was stunning, really, how much he'd come to rely on the casual use of magic. Everything from warming up his socks in the morning to applying a small Cushioning Charm to his glasses so the cheap plastic didn't chafe at his nose – magic was a part of Harry, now.

Amos Diggory strode into the living room with a beaming smile. "Going to show Harry the ropes, eh? Don't worry, Harry. Just let Ced show you how it's done."

Harry suppressed a flicker of irritation. "I plan to."

It wasn't bitingly cold outside, and after a few minutes of walking through the snow-covered fields leading away from the village, Harry even began to regret wearing the thick wool scarf Cho had given him as an early Christmas gift. The weather was clear and sunny and the snow glittered where the light caught it just right. Cedric clomped along beside him, his heavy boots leaving deep tracks in the snow. The two of them carried their broomsticks slung over their shoulders.

"Glorious day, isn't it?" said Amos, looking around with a jovial smile. "Excellent Quidditch weather." He clapped a hand to Cedric's shoulder and leaned in conspiratorially. "Now, I know you're planning a little pickup game with those Weasley boys, but don't forget, Ced, you're playing them later this year. Don't want to tip your hand too early."

"I think the cat's out of the bag on that one," said Harry, trying to keep his tone dry and not irritated. "Cedric and I have been flying together for quite a while now. We don't really have any moves the other one hasn't seen."

"That's what you think," said Amos, with an annoying little smile and a wag of his finger. "Just you wait until Hufflepuff plays Gryffindor next term!"

Harry glanced over to Cedric, who hadn't reacted at all. He was walking along blithely, apparently without a care in the world.

Troubled and a bit off-balance, Harry's only reply to Amos was a shrug and a "we'll see."

The river, thought Harry when they got there, was more like a stream that had gotten too big for its britches. It was wide and it burbled. The bank was mostly covered in snow, but Amos led them upstream to a little jutting spur that turned into a sand bank, and Vanished the snow with a wave of his wand, leaving a cozy little flat space.

Cedric wordlessly passed his wand to Amos, and then reached into his coat and pulled out what looked like two postage stamp-sized scraps of canvas. Harry watched as Cedric started unfolding them, over and over, the canvas expanding and twisting in his hands until he was holding a serviceable, if battered, lawn chair.

"Neat, eh?" said Cedric, grinning as he started working on the second one. "Magical folding chairs."

"Not bad," said Harry, taking the first one and plopping it down in the sand.

Amos was holding Cedric's wand high in the air, twirling it in a complicated motion. He held it behind him, arm cocked as if he were going to throw it. "Peskipiksi Pesternomi!" On the last syllable, he brought the wand down and forward, and a thin silver line burst forth. It spooled out into the water, something small, glittering, and gold attached to the end.

He passed the wand to Cedric, who took it, holding it cradled loosely but attentively in front of him as he sat on one of the folding chairs, his broomstick leaning up against the armrest. Amos held out his hand to Harry. "Your turn, lad."

"Right," said Harry. He hesitated only a moment before handing over his wand. There wasn't any particular taboo about letting someone else use your wand – he'd used Cedric's and Cho's on any number of occasions – but it was, well, personal. Harry felt a connection to the holly and phoenix feather wand above and beyond what he could rationally defend. Something to ask Fleur about, maybe.

Amos repeated the spell and cast the line into the river, then passed it back to Harry.

"The charm lasts a few hours," said Cedric as Harry sat beside him. "It makes it so that a few simple wand motions control the line. Swish and flick to reel it in, for example. I'll teach you the others."

"That's my boy," said Amos, beaming. He took a step back. "I'll leave you lads to it, then. Be back before it gets dark, and say hello to Arthur for me if you head out that way." He gave them a wave, and then he was off.

Cedric was quiet for a minute. Harry didn't press him. The sound of the river was pleasant. Harry ran his hands over his wand, trying to feel the magic of the fishing spell.

"And there you have it," said Cedric after a while. "That's my dad. All the worst parts of an absentee parent combined with all the worst parts of a nosey, over-involved parent."

"I wasn't going to say anything," said Harry. "I've always thought it would be a bit nice to have a normal family. But…"

"But it turns out there's really no such thing." Cedric looked to the right, upstream, where the river snaked around a bend. "You know, I ran away from home, once. I was… eight, I think? It was over something pretty stupid. We were having a dinner party with a bunch of Dad's Ministry friends, and Mum had me dress up, and I hated it. They were trying to make me something I wasn't, you see. I remember being so angry. They didn't understand me, they wanted to change me, they were putting pressure on me to be a certain way, stuff like that. Typical sulky kid stuff. It's not like my family's really that bad or anything."

Harry didn't say anything, just let Cedric talk. He felt the line on his wand dip for a second and he jerked forward, surprised, but it went slack again.

Picking up on the motion, Cedric caught his eye. "Like this, when you feel a bite." He did a swish-and-flick, a rather abbreviated one, and the line went taut, zipping back up to the end of Cedric's wand. The lure was golden and shiny, a spiky little ball about the size of a Snitch, but with a couple dozen hooks on it. "Then you hold it back, and cast." He did so, bringing his arm back, then forward, the line of silver unspooling again, drifting a bit as it floated, then sunk.

"I get it," said Harry. "Casting. That's rather clever."

Cedric shrugged, went quiet again for a moment. "I came here after I ran away," he said after a while. "Right down to the river, to this spot, actually. Then I started walking upstream. I'd always wanted to find out where it came from. Where'd it start? What's the beginning of a river? I didn't know anything about it, but it seemed like whatever it was, it would be magical, and worth discovering."

"It's kind of impressive that you turned running away from home into something productive," said Harry. And then he made a connection: Cedric, seeing himself in the Mirror of Erised. He'd seen himself in exotic lands, uncovering ancient mysteries… "You wanted to be an explorer."

"Still do, I think," said Cedric. "Maybe someday."

They fished for a while. Fishing, it seemed to Harry, was something that lent itself well to silence. The calm was broken only once, when Harry thought he felt a tug at the line, reeled it in a bit overzealously, and got his line tangled with Cedric's. This led to a few awkward jokes about their lines touching, and then silence again, for a time.

Harry was just starting to get bored with fishing when the girl showed up. She came walking down the bank on the other side of the river, bobbing and weaving as if slightly drunk, which probably had to do with the fact that she seemed intent on looking exactly everywhere but right in front of her. She had long, slightly straggly dirty-blonde hair, and large, pale-grey eyes that gave her face an aura of permanent surprise. She was carrying a woven basket in one hand, and a large, leather-bound book in the other. She looked to be ten, maybe eleven.

Cedric grinned, then whistled to get her attention. "Hello, Luna!"

The girl came to a stop – not abruptly, but like a large ship coming in to port, slowly reversing the engines. She shuffled down the snow-covered bank and stood at the edge of the river as she waved to them. "Hello, Cedric! Hello, Harry Potter!"

"Er, hello," said Harry. He glanced at Cedric. "Friend of yours?" he asked, sotto voce.

"Of sorts," said Cedric, making no attempt to lower his voice. "The Lovegoods live in the area. She stayed with us a few times after her mum died, when her dad was really going through a rough spell."

Luna was bobbing her head. "That's exactly what happened," said Luna. "Although I was very sad as well. Cedric tried to cheer me up by taking me on broomstick rides, and they were wonderful, but I wasn't any less sad."

"What are you doing out here, Luna?" asked Cedric.

"It seemed like a good day to search for Gulping Plimpies," she said. She raised her hand and waggled the woven basket. "I made a new Plimpy trap. It's elm." She said this last bit with an air of great importance.

"I see," said Harry, who didn't quite.

"What are you two doing with those lines?" she asked, looking extremely curious.

"We're fishing," said Cedric.

"Oh. Really?" said Luna, leaning forward, for a moment looking like she might topple into the river. "What for?"

Harry shook his head. "I honestly don't know. Fish?"

"Barbel, if we're lucky," said Cedric. "Although I wouldn't say no to a Silver Sickleback – their eyes are used in all kinds of potions."

"Wait, there's such a thing as a Barbel fish?" said Harry.

"Um, yes?" said Cedric.

Harry made a mental note to buy one for Sirius.

Luna was inspecting the lines coming from Harry and Cedric's wands. "That seems like a very odd way of catching fish," she declared at last.

"What would you suggest?" asked Cedric.

"Have you tried asking politely?" Luna's question came with a kind of earnestness that temporarily locked Harry's mental gears in place as he tried to process it.

Without waiting for an answer, Luna knelt at the river's edge, bent forward, and stuck her head under the water. A small but steady stream of bubbles broke the surface downstream.

Harry and Cedric sat there.

"Huh."

They exchanged a glance. Harry looked back at the river. "Should we do anything?"

Cedric shrugged. "If the bubbles stop, sure."

"Is she always like… that?" asked Harry, gesturing to the partially-submerged girl on the other side of the river.

"Like what?" asked Cedric. "She's always awesome, if that's what you're asking."

"No, I mean… is she really clever, or really insane?"

Cedric shrugged, taking one hand off his wand and rocking it in a back-and-forth motion. "Protego, Protago."

"But… that's not…" Harry scrubbed a hand through his hair. "That's not a good phrase. They're not different, equal interpretations of the same thing. If you actually pronounced it Protago – " Harry did a quick and dirty Arithmancy calculation in his head " – your shield would form, but it would be asymmetrical and it would only stop spells that had an odd number of letters in the incantation."

"Geez," said Cedric. "Ruin perfectly good jokes much?"

Whatever response Harry might have fired back with was lost as Luna came to the surface with a huge gasp of air. She shook her head briskly, water droplets flying everywhere, and then took the larger clumps between her hands and started wringing them out.

"I'm very sorry," she said solemnly. "But you two have scared all the fish away with those ghastly hooks."

Harry stood up and swished-and-flicked, the line zooming back into the wand. "That's all right, Luna. Thanks for trying."

"You're very welcome, Harry Potter," said Luna, turning that wide-eyed gaze on him.

"You can just call me Harry, you know."

"Can I?" she said, tilting her head. "I'll do that, then."

Cedric reeled in his own line. "We should probably pack it up and get going if we're going to have enough light for Quidditch."

Harry stood and started folding up his chair. "Yeah, agreed. That's enough fishing for one day." He gave Luna a wave, which she returned from across the river. "It was nice to meet you, strange girl. Are you coming to Hogwarts soon? Maybe I'll see you there." After Harry finished talking, he realized that it was possible she was already a Hogwarts student, a first year he'd never paid attention to. It would be embarrassing, but true to form.

Thankfully, she just nodded energetically. "Next year! It would be nice to see you there."

Cedric waved goodbye, and the two of them gathered up their broomsticks and started walking away from the river. Harry looked back over his shoulder and saw that Luna was knee-deep in the river, arms outstretched, the woven basket she'd brought covering her entire head like a helmet.

Cedric followed Harry's gaze, and laughed. "She's really something, isn't she?"

"I guess Hogwarts could always use another wild card," said Harry. "So, where do the Weasleys live?"

It turned out the Weasleys lived in a house called the Burrow, which looked to Harry like someone had haphazardly stacked four houses on top of each other. The house was on the outskirts of the village, and it took them a good long while to walk there. Harry had made the case to fly very low to the ground, but Cedric had nixed it. The sun was edging closer to the horizon as the two of them tromped up the low-sloping hill to the Burrow.

Harry fell behind Cedric as the older boy stepped up to the front door and knocked.

"If we're lucky, Charlie will be home for Christmas," said Cedric as they waited. "He's frankly dangerous on a broom."

"The more the merrier," said Harry. "We could use some bodies if we're trying to get a good game going."

"Well, we've come to the right place for that," mumbled Cedric as the door opened.

Ron Weasley was wearing pajamas that were more holes than fabric. He yawned and blinked as he regarded them. "Blimey. What are you two doing here so early?"

"It's the late afternoon, Weasley," said Cedric.

"Is it?" Ron scratched his head and looked up at the sky with a bleary expression. "Well, I guess that's okay, then."

Cedric looked like he was going to say something sarcastic, so Harry stepped forward. "We're looking to play some Quidditch, Ron. Are Fred and George around?"

"Sure," said Ron, stifling another yawn. "Come on in, I'll get them."

The three of them piled inside. It was warm and comfortable and a little cramped. The front door opened right into the living room, which opened into the kitchen, and every inch of space was accounted for. There were chairs and couches, and photos on the wall and knick-knacks on the shelves, and nothing was organized but everything gave the impression of being used and functional.

Ron trudged up the stairs, calling for his brothers. On the way up, he passed a small, redheaded girl who was practically swimming in an oversized jumper.

She made it about halfway down the stairs before she froze, her eyes locked on Harry. Her eyes got wider and wider.

"Uh, hi," said Harry, bemused.

"Meep!" said the girl, or at least that's what Harry heard, as she turned and blinked up the stairs so fast she might have Apparated.

"Well, that was a thing," said Cedric.

"I take it that was yet another Weasley?"

"The youngest," said Cedric. "Ginny. I have no idea what that was about, though."

"Oh!" A woman who could only be described as matronly bustled into the living room from the kitchen. She had Weasley-red hair, a rather round figure, and carried with her a cloud of cooking scents that hit Harry squarely in the gut with a kind of preemptive nostalgia for all the warm, normal Christmases he'd never have.

"Hello, Cedric, dear! And you," she said, turning to Harry, "must be Harry Potter. Fred and George have told me all about you." Her brow furrowed. "I'm sure they were just making up some of it."

"Wouldn't put it past them," said Harry. He briefly considered offering his hand, but he could read that play: the woman in front of him practically radiated 'I will hug you.'

"Can I get you anything to eat, dears?" she asked.

"No thanks, Mrs. Weasley," said Cedric. "We were actually hoping to play a little Quidditch."

"Oh?" Her warm smile faded a bit. "It's getting a bit dark, isn't it?"

Fred and George chose that moment to come galloping down the stairs, each of them carrying a broomstick that clattered carelessly against the slats.

"Nice to meet you, Mrs. Weasley," said Harry as Fred and George's whirlwind of motion started carrying them all towards the door.

"Don't stay out too late!" said Mrs. Weasley. "Take some fudge!" She moved with surprising alacrity for a woman of her size, pressing large, string-wrapped packages on Harry and Cedric before they could make it out the door.

Fred and George let out twin whoops of delight as they dragged Harry and Cedric outside. "Finally!" said Fred. "We expected you days ago. This is going to be fun." The twins led them down to a rickety-looking shed, from which they retrieved a battered, but functional set of Quidditch balls, minus a Snitch.

A minute later, Ron Weasley joined them, carrying a broom and finally wearing actual clothes. A minute after that, a window opened on the top floor of the Burrow, and an older, very muscled, very enthusiastic redhead toppled out, diving for two stories and then recovering on his broom a few feet above the ground in an acrobatic move.

"We can play three-on-three with Charlie and Ron," said George, grinning.

"Evening, boys," said Charlie Weasley, swooping down and hovering a few feet above them. "I hear you're pretty good at Quidditch, Harry. Want to find out exactly how good?"



* * *



"You should really be a Chaser," said Cedric for what felt like the hundredth time.

"So you've said," said Harry. "A few times, if I recall."

"It's just… that shot. It was so damn good. Tatiana Ionescu misses shots like that half the time."

Christmas morning had become less about presents and more about Cedric rehashing the three-on-three Quidditch game for the umpteenth time. The two of them were in Cedric's room drinking hot chocolate and exchanging gifts. Cedric's parents were downstairs – his mum was in the midst of making an elaborate brunch, and his dad had had his head in the Floo for the last hour, methodically wishing each and every person his in Ministry department an extra-merry Christmas.

"It was a lucky shot," said Harry. "It could have gone anywhere. It just happened to make it through the ring."

Cedric shook his head as he blew on the surface of the hot drink. "It was instinct, is what it was. Ron set up perfectly, and you put enough spin on it to bank it past him."

"Okay, okay," said Harry, waving his hand. "First thing I do when we get back, I'll tell Oliver I'm quitting Seeker to be a backup Chaser."

Cedric paused, probably imagining the scene. "Fair point," he said.

They were interrupted by a cacophony of hooting from outside. Harry raced to the window and opened it. Hedwig was coming in for a landing, and a team of at least a dozen large owls tag-teaming a heavy package followed her. The owl team was coming in hot.

"Incoming, get down!" yelled Harry. He dove to the side, and Cedric's hot chocolate went flying as the older boy ducked in front of his bed. The owls made it through the window with very little room to spare, and the package, which was rectangular and large, hit the floor with a resounding crash.

"Everything okay up there, Cedric?" That was Cedric's mother calling from downstairs, sounding perfectly unconcerned even though she had to yell over the screeching of owls.

"We're fine!" yelled Cedric as he got up, grabbing a towel and using it to mop up the spilled hot drink. Harry was consulting with the lead owl, counting out Sickles and stuffing them into its leg pouch. Satisfied, the owl team took flight, winging out the window of Cedric's bedroom one by one like something from a cartoon musical.

"That wasn't quite what I expected," said Harry. "The brochure said they guaranteed a speedy delivery – I guess they meant that literally."

"What the shit, Harry?" said Cedric.

"It's your Christmas present. I sent Hedwig off with an Owl Order form a couple days ago."

Cedric looked at the package, which had propelled itself into the far wall, coming to rest against the bookcase, a few stray books on top of it, jostled down from the impact. "Did they have to deliver it in such a dramatic fashion?"

"Maybe I shouldn't have picked the 'ludicrous speed' premium delivery option," said Harry. "Anyway, open it."

Still glaring at him, Cedric slid the package to the center of the room and started tearing off the heavy brown paper.

Harry moved to the wall and leaned against it, crossing his arms. He was very aware of his own posture. He didn't really know how to stand when giving a gift, or what expression to have on his face.

The paper fell away, revealing a smaller version of a standard Hogwarts trunk. Cedric looked at it, his eyes crinkling in confusion. "Thanks, Harry, this is great?" There was an unmistakable question on the end of that.

Stepping forward and kneeling, Harry flipped open the trunk, revealing an empty, mundane compartment. There was a small brass key taped to the inside, and Harry reached in and grabbed it. "It's a standard trunk on the inside, except that it's got a little something extra." He closed the lid, took the key, jammed it in the lock, and spun it around four times. He opened the lid again.

Cedric's eyes went wide. The trunk opened into a… space. They looked down over the lip at a small wooden ladder that descended into a cramped, bare room.

"I was thinking," said Harry, still not quite sure what to do with his hands now that he'd stepped back to let Cedric examine his gift, "ever since I've been here, you seemed really happy to have your potions lab. Maybe now you can take it with you when we go back."

Cedric looked flabbergasted as he peered into the room. He stood and looked at Harry, and his face broke into a wide, heartfelt grin. "Brilliant. Thank you, Harry. I mean it."

"You're welcome," said Harry. "You know, I was kind of worried you'd say it was too much or something."

"It is," said Cedric, still in the same tone. "But you don't say that. A gift freely given has a kind of power, you know. You know the old saying about gifts and gratitude – or, I guess you don't, growing up with Muggles. You don't spoil something like that." He took a long stride forward and gave Harry a one-armed hug, clapping him on the shoulder. "So – thanks, Harry."

"Right," said Harry, only slightly embarrassed as he stepped back.

"I guess that means it's my turn." Cedric went to his desk and grabbed a loosely-bundled sheaf of parchment that was sitting on a stack of other papers. He handed it to Harry without ceremony. "Here. Sorry, I'm rubbish at wrapping things."

With a twist of his fingers, Harry deftly undid the loose binding and uncovered the first page. The parchment was crisp, so new he could almost smell it. The first page was evidently just a cover, with only a few words scrawled on it.

Application to Auror Program, Essay Portion. And, underneath, a thick line with the word APPLICANT written in block letters below. On the line was a messy signature.

James Potter

"I asked my dad about it," said Cedric. "He had to pull some strings. They're not really supposed to give those out, but he dropped your name, and knew the right people. It's just the copy… the original's on file at the Ministry somewhere. Apparently it's kind of legendary, though. Your dad's answers to some of the essay questions are supposed to be hilarious. I thought, you know, you had something of your mum's that she'd written, but not your dad, so…" he trailed off. Now it was Cedric's turn to look embarrassed.

"Thank you," said Harry, his voice oddly quiet and his throat oddly thick.

Hours later, it was mostly silent in Cedric's room. Christmas night, the house was warm, the dark outside a distant thought. The silence was only broken occasionally. Harry, propped up on Cedric's bed, would laugh out loud for a moment. Pages would rustle as he flipped to a new one. Sounds came, now and then, from the trunk. First clinks and clanks as Cedric moved his potions lab into the trunk, punctuated by a few curses as he maneuvered a few larger items carefully down the ladder. Then, the sound of a happily bubbling cauldron and Cedric humming to himself.

Cedric emerged from the trunk, all smiles. He held a vial that was cloudy pink and still faintly smoking. "Just did a trial run." He gave it a little shake and held it out. "Want to give it a test?"

Harry looked at it apprehensively. "What's that supposed to be?"

"Calming Draught."

Without pausing, Harry downed the vial. It tasted like a forest floor, but not in an altogether unpleasant way.

"Just like that?" asked Cedric, raising an eyebrow.

"Sure," said Harry, shrugging. "You know what Snape said to me during the last class before the holiday? He said, 'That fool Hufflepuff of a friend of yours is not entirely abysmal at Potions.' Pretty high praise, coming from him."

"I suppose," said Cedric doubtfully.

"So how do we know if this potion is working, anyway? I was already feeling pretty calm."

Cedric hummed. "I think Cho likes you."

"Okay."

"How's that feel?"

Harry thought about it. "Fine."

"I'd say it's working, then."

"Do you really think that, though, or were you just saying it to test me?"

"Yes."

Harry cocked his head. "I feel like I should be really irritated right now, but I'm not."

"It should wear off in a few hours."

There was a pathetic kind of horking sound from the corner of the room.

"Looks like Hedwig got into that fudge we got from Mrs. Weasley," said Cedric.

"That's true," said Harry.

"Looks like she threw up all over your jacket."

"Well, at least I'm calm about it."



* * *



Back at Hogwarts, time seemed to speed up. Harry stepped back into the routine of morning Quidditch practice, evening study, and stolen moments with friends, and before he knew it, a week had gone by. Then two. He found himself marking the time by upcoming Quidditch matches. He started to hear conversations about the standings at mealtimes, in the hallway between classes, in the Common Room. And then, just like that, the first game of the second term was upon them.

It was an altogether strange experience watching Ravenclaw play Hufflepuff.

"So, who are you rooting for?" asked Hermione. She had to raise her voice. The stands were loud that day, and the Gryffindor section was particularly enthusiastic considering it was a game they weren't playing in.

"I'm not," said Harry. The crowd roared as Cedric picked off the Quaffle and dropped it back to the Chaser line. "We knew it was going to be a thing, when the three of us all made Seeker. We agreed to just play our hardest and not take things personally."

"That sounds good in theory," said Hermione, "but it didn't work so well when you played Cho."

"That's a lesson I think Cedric learned by watching it happen." Harry's eyes tracked Cho as she pulled up and shot through the air at a near-vertical angle. Cedric tore after her.

"So he's not going to go easy on her?" Hermione was watching the game with what looked like reluctant interest that was slowly turning to genuine curiosity as she watched the Seeker duel.

Harry laughed. "He'll run her right into the pitch if he gets the chance, if only to show how much he respects her."

"It sounds kind of wrong when you say it like that."

"It's a competitive sports thing," said Harry, shrugging. "Sports are completely meaningless, and they only matter because we say they matter. We create their meaning ourselves. And if one person doesn't live up to that, it's bad for the whole."

"I… see," said Hermione, blinking rapidly, sounding only half-confident of her statement.

They paused as the crowd noise swelled again – Roger Davies had put another one through, pushing Ravenclaw's lead to nearly a hundred.

"Hufflepuff really needs a better Keeper," said Harry, mostly to himself. He turned to the girl sitting next to him. "So, how are you hitting it off with Padma and Tracey? I see the three of you sitting together in the library quite often."

"It's nice," said Hermione. "They like to study, and they like to argue with me. Tracey can be kind of scary sometimes, but she's really quite – "

Hermione cut off as the crowd roared. Harry stood up, his eyes fixed on the center of the pitch. Cedric was in a full-on dive, Cho angling towards him. She pulled up alongside him as they plummeted, Cedric's arm outstretched. Cho jostled him, he nudged back, and then there was a confusing moment where it looked like they were each trying to cut the other off at the same time –

And then it was over. Harry was practically deafened by the cheers as Cedric leveled off, pumping his fist, holding up the small golden ball to his ecstatic teammates.

As he made his way down the stands, Harry started thinking about how we was going to congratulate one friend while consoling the other.



* * *



Weeks later, sitting in exactly the same seat, Harry was a spectator yet again. It was easier, in a way, to watch Ravenclaw play Slytherin. Harry sat on the outskirts of the Gryffindor section of the stands with Cedric, and the two of them cheered every time Cho made a particularly good move. It was certainly simpler to know whom to root for.

On the other hand, Slytherin played dirty, and even though Harry swore to himself that he was going to think of Cho just like any other friend, she was small and slight and pretty, and a stupid yet insistent part of Harry's brain was telling him it wasn't okay that Vaisey kept hitting Bludgers at her.

"So if they win, then Ravenclaw's two and one, and Slytherin's oh and three. That means it'll be down to us, Harry." Cedric sounded excited about it. Hufflepuff hadn't won the Cup in ages, and the buzz in the hallways was noticeable whenever the subject came up. "If Hufflepuff wins, we'll have run the table, but if you win, then all three of us are two and one and it goes to tiebreakers." Cedric furrowed his brow as he started to talk rapidly. "You caught the Snitch fast against Slytherin, so even if Cho doesn't let this drag on too long, Ravenclaw would be up by point differential…"

"Cedric, I'm trying to watch the game."

Cedric kept talking to himself, but quieted down to a mumble.

Harry's eyes tracked Cho as she tore through the Slytherin Chaser line, coming perilously close to a collision. He consciously unclenched his fists and concentrated on breathing normally.

And in a flash, it was over. There was no dramatic chase, no race to the finish. Cho abruptly swerved to the left, dipped, and caught the Snitch. The crowd rumbled, starting small as only a few even noticed at first, then built to a roar.

"Damn, just look at her," said Cedric as they watched Cho getting mobbed and hoisted aloft by her teammates. Cedric's expression was almost wistful. "She's glowing. You can see it even from up here. Look how much she owns that moment. She's like the damn sun."

"Girl likes Quidditch," said Harry. "You know, this win means even if I catch the Snitch against you when we play, all I'm doing is handing the Cup to her, most likely."

Cedric turned to meet his gaze. "It's different. You won't be handing it to her. Not as long as you go all-out. Sometimes beating your opponent doesn't involve winning yourself."

"Hmm." Harry looked back at Cho, who was doing a victory lap. "I like that she's like that, actually. She's committed."

"I like that she has a life outside us," said Cedric pensively. "She'd be okay without us. She's got her own friends. She's popular, and pretty…" his eyes widened for a second and he talked faster, riding right over his slip. "I'm just saying, it makes me respect her more, that not everything's about us."

Harry smiled, a small, private one. "But you like that she likes us best, right?"

Cedric just grinned. "Of course."



* * *



And in the end, it went down just like Harry had always known it would. His life narrowed to a dual focus: studying for end of term exams, and The Last Game, the one that would determine the winner of the Quidditch Cup. Even his various extra-curricular projects seemed to fall by the wayside in the waning weeks of his second year. He wasn't proud of it, exactly, but Harry had discovered a part of himself that wanted to win, and it was much easier to think about how he'd win the Cup for Gyrffindor than to think about how little progress he'd made in the last three months uncovering the mysteries of Hogwarts.

He'd gone to Wood, and he'd said, I think I know how we can win the Cup. And he'd laid out his strategy, and Wood had balked at it, because it was incredibly risky. It was a play that professional Quidditch teams only fell back on in times of desperation. But Wood agreed, in the end, because Gryffindor needed to win by four hundred points.

So after his team rose into the air clad in red and gold and facing Cedric's, after Wood had shaken Heidi Macavoy's hand, after Hooch had blown the whistle, instead of shooting up to start looking for the Snitch and spar with Cedric, Harry had fallen in line with Alicia, Angelina, and Katie.

Under normal circumstances, Gryffindor's Chasers outclassed Hufflepuff's by a noticeable margin. With Harry Potter joining them as a fourth Chaser, it was barely a contest. They put twenty goals through in ten minutes, putting Hufflepuff completely on their back foot. Cedric looked like he might abandon the hunt for the Snitch and try to counter Harry, but he thought better of it and redoubled his efforts.

Harry could practically feel the stadium holding its breath as he pressed the attack. He caught the Quaffle, passed it, cut forward, saw Angelina toss it back to Katie, who immediately dove. Alicia set a perfect screen, Katie tore through the opposing Chasers, drawing a Bludger, but smoothly passed to Harry, who'd gotten open in the meantime, and Harry put it through the center hoop, dead on.

It was almost intoxicating. They were running the table, up two hundred and thirty to Hufflepuff's meager forty. Lee Jordan was talking rapid-fire in the booth about tactics – anyone catching the Snitch now would ensure a Ravenclaw victory. Cedric, seeming to realize this, broke off from his solitary search and joined the fray. He wasn't elegant about it, but he started cutting in front of Harry, blocking him.

"Macavoy on the breakaway, two on one, and Wood SAVES IT by the tips of his fingers!" Lee's voice boomed over the roaring crowd. "Gryffindor still up by one-ninety, needing sixty more to put them over the top with a Snitch catch."

Harry slipped by Cedric and intercepted a pass, starting to race down the field. He leaned forward, pushing the Nimbus for all it was worth, the wind whistling through his fingers as he dipped and dodged. Just a little more, just a little longer.

And then the crowd gasped as one. Harry didn't even need to see it. He flipped over and hauled his broom around, throwing the Quaffle in Angelina's direction, not even watching to see if she caught it.

Cedric had spotted the Snitch. Even as Harry raced after him, his thoughts were racing faster. He must know he can't win. We're too far ahead. All he can do is catch the Snitch and make sure we don't win either. But if I catch it first, the same thing happens.

Harry dropped in front of Cedric with a vicious sideswipe, throwing them both into a spin. Cedric recovered first, his larger body wrestling the Cleansweep into compliance, but Harry was faster, and tore after him, catching up in a scant few seconds. The crowd was really yelling at him now. It was a borderline move, but not a foul. It was a fine line – Harry would play him as hard as he could, but he wouldn't stoop to the level of strategic fouling. He'd just have to keep Cedric off the Snitch until they went up another sixty.

Yeah, right.

They skimmed the ground, chasing the zigzagging golden ball, and Cedric's eyes never wavered. He swerved out of the way of a precise Bludger sent in by Fred Weasley, but never took his eye off the ball, even when George, picking it up on the backside, smacked it right back at him.

Harry pulled alongside Cedric.

For a stretched-out moment, they saw each other. For one portion of one second surrounded by blurs of motion and riotous sound and pure adrenaline, Harry saw his opponent's aspect and knew, and knew that he knew, what was about to happen.

And the next moment was a series of chopped up flashes that seemed to happen with no transition between them, experienced by Harry all at once. The twitch of the golden ball. The reaction, as Harry and Cedric dove as one. The arch of Cedric's body as he leaned forward and put everything into a desperate stretch. The fluidity of Harry's motion, the broom an extension of himself, as he twisted, inverted, his hand sweeping down and brushing the grass of the pitch. The feel of the golden ball smacking his palm. The quiet of the crowd as they processed what had happened. And then, the steadily building jubilation from the bronze-and-blue.



* * *



"Honestly, I don't even need a broom right now, I could just float here all on my own," said Cho.

"That would look very odd, I think," said Cedric.

"And then you'd have no place to put your little trophy," said Harry.

Cho was pretty much radiating pure joy as they balanced in the air, hovering around a conjured stone bowl. The bluebell flames were mostly for show; it was spring, and sunny, a textbook beautiful day in Scotland. Cho might as well have had songbirds perched on her shoulders. The heavy, gleaming Quidditch Cup that stood affixed to the front of her broom like a masthead left little doubt as to the source of her exuberance.

"Yeah, yeah, make your little jokes," she said. "Today, I'm untouchable."

"Doesn't it feel a bit strange to not have played in the game that won it for you?" asked Cedric. "I know I'd feel kind of bad about that."

"Not really," said Cho, shrugging. "We had you guys right where we wanted." She grinned like a cat. "And I trusted that your egos would rather the other one not win than lose yourself."

"I'm fine with it, in the end," said Harry, looking out over the grounds. It was the weekend, but even so, he could see dozens of students studying for end of term exams while still taking advantage of the nice day. "We each won one and lost one."

"And beat the hell out of Slytherin," said Cedric with a small smile. "I was talking to Vaisey, before. I think they're going to give Higgs the sack."

"He didn't get particularly close to the Snitch in all three games," said Cho. "I wouldn't be shocked."

"I wonder who they'll replace him with," said Cedric.

"As long as Flint's still captain, I can't imagine it being someone decent," said Cho. "Vaisey told me part of the tryout is being able to demonstrate at least a hundred ways to foul someone, and I think he was just kidding, but…"

"Is that Daphne?" interrupted Harry. He was shading his eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun, looking in the direction of the Forbidden Forest. He saw a flash of dark hair and a familiar cream-colored jumper.

"Looks like it," said Cedric, following Harry's gaze and squinting. "Wonder what she's up to?"

"I'm going to go take a look," said Harry, pulling his broom around. "I'll catch up with you guys later. Congratulations again, Cho." He nudged the broom forward, passing Cho and giving her a pat on the arm.

He sped up, zipping down past Hagrid's hut, shadowing Daphne from above. She was just stepping into the tree line when Harry caught up with her. He kept himself directly above her, taking advantage of the fact that people very rarely looked straight up. Daphne was walking deeper into the Forest, but she didn't seem to have a particular direction. She would stop and start, looking around, sometimes consulting something that looked like a watch that she held in her hand.

Harry dropped down silently until he was about ten feet above her. "Afternoon, Daphne."

She spun in place, arms akimbo, and tripped over her feet. "Potter?" Her voice was sharp as she looked up from a sitting position. She cleared her throat, her features smoothing out. "I mean, Harry? What are you doing?"

"I was about to ask you the same question," he said, waggling a finger. "It's called the Forbidden Forest for a reason, you know."

Daphne stood up and dusted off her hands. Harry came in for a landing, sweeping his broom adroitly onto his shoulders. (Cho had finally, after much wheedling, taught Harry and Cedric the move.)

"That doesn't seem to stop you from being out here," she pointed out.

"I didn't think anyone noticed," said Harry mildly.

Daphne rolled her eyes. "I don't think you quite grasp the nature of your fame, Harry. People notice when you're late to lunch, and if you happen to have hiccups, too, by the time dinner rolls around, there'll be a rumor that you gave yourself permanent hiccups as a side effect of an aborted Dark ritual."

Harry frowned. "I didn't think it was quite that bad."

"Then you're pretty unobservant." Her grin took the sting out of the words.

"That's entirely possible."

They were quiet for a moment.

"I came out here to look for the phoenix," Daphne blurted out.

Harry blinked. He hadn't expected her to just tell him like that. "You don't think that's just a legend?" he asked carefully.

"I'm sure it's not," she said. "And no, I'm not telling you why I'm looking for it."

"Honestly, I'm kind of surprised you told me at all."

"You helped me with the I.H.C.C.," she said quietly. "And you're not unpleasant. For a boy."

They stood there for a while, the dappled sunlight filtering in through the spray of trees. Birds chirped, and crickets hummed, but towards the center of the Forest, where the trees got thicker, it looked darker and less inviting.

"That's why I come out here too. I'm looking for the phoenix as well," said Harry. He smiled. "And I won't tell you why either."

He wanted to, though. Making a connection with someone wasn't simply a matter of time – he'd liked Cedric straightaway, on the train, and it wasn't as simple as piling up interactions with a person, like putting coins into a vending machine until "friendship" popped out. But without the keys to the Refuge, there wasn't a good enough reason to bare his secrets – telling Cho and Cedric as much as he had was a terrible risk. The Ministry had been quiet, all things considered. But those Aurors were still watching, still waiting, and Harry had the strong feeling that if he tipped his hand again, they wouldn't stop at hauling him in for questioning, they'd go for his friends, too, and damn the public relations fallout. And his friends didn't know Occlumency.

"It's not that I don't trust you," he said, almost sheepishly. "It's just that there's kind of a big downside to telling you."

"I see," said Daphne. "So you have secrets, but you trust me enough to tell me that you have them."

"I do," said Harry. He looked right into her eyes. "And does that go both ways?"

"I suppose it does."

Daphne's expression was a strange mix of gratitude, curiosity, and annoyance. Those sea-green eyes were fixed on his, her dark, wavy hair in disarray from the fall. He'd never really thought about it until that moment, but they looked a bit alike, in coloring at least. She was an interesting one, Daphne Greengrass. Harry wondered at her reasons. It was highly doubtful they were the same as Harry's – as far as he knew, no one else was searching for the lost Founder's Rooms and trying to piece together hints to their location with symbols and guesses and clues scattered in space and time around Hogwarts.

"I'm going back, then," she said. "If you noticed me come out here, I'm sure others did. I'll have to do this another time."

"We could look together, if you want." The words seemed to slip from Harry's mouth without him really noticing. He was a little surprised he'd said it.

"No thanks," she said, shaking her head brusquely. She started walking back towards the grounds, but paused after a few seconds, half-turning her head back. "But ask me again another time."

Harry watched her, more than a little bemused, until she'd cleared the tree line.

"Huh."

He was about to mount his broom and fly back to Cedric and Cho when he noticed a snake watching him. It was a pale green color and had its head raised up towards Harry, with the rest of its body coiled on a stone. It was just a small, garden variety snake, the kind you could find a thousand of in the woods.

Harry paused. Now, wasn't that an idea?

He cleared his throat. "Hello."

The snake regarded him, the head moving back and forth in a sinuous back-and-forth. "Hello," it replied, and nothing more.

Harry cleared his throat again and raised his voice. He spread his arms in a grand gesture. "Snakes of the Forest, hear me!"

He could see them popping up here and there – raising heads out of the grass, sliding out of holes in the ground, peeking out from behind trees. Dozens of them.

"I command you, search for the phoenix of the Forest, mark his location well, and inform me of it! Tell every one of your brethren you encounter of this task, and never cease until you've found the creature of red-gold fire!"

Parseltongue, it turned out, lent itself well to a certain kind of grandiose speech.

The snakes just looked at Harry. And then, one by one, they slithered away.

One snake – the first one Harry had seen, paused just as it was about to vanish into a patch of tall grass. It turned and looked back at Harry.

"Go ssssscrew yourself."

Flying back to where Cho and Cedric hung in the air around the stone bowl, Harry had two thoughts. One, I'd like to find out more about Daphne Greengrass. And two, snakes are assholes.



* * *



Two weeks into the summer, Harry had never felt more exhausted in his life.

It had started oddly, as conversations with Albus Dumbledore tended to go.

His first day back on the island, Harry had decided he would be lazy and indolent, at least for the afternoon. He woke up in his bed in Privet Drive, stumbled through the wardrobe to Greece, and was treated to a "welcome to summer" breakfast by Sirius. Remus updated him on their tentative investigations into Doge's odd behavior – Ariana was undisturbed at St. Mungo's, and Aberforth, with all the powers granted to the Headmaster, confirmed that Doge had by all accounts spent a boring year at Hogwarts teaching Defense and grading papers. Neither Sirius nor Remus seemed unduly concerned with the matter. They were more excited about tracking down a rumor about strange activities in Italy – snakes acting oddly, Obliviators called in, Dark activities suspected. The kind of rumor Remus had spent the last decade chasing.

This was unsettling to Harry, for reasons he couldn't quite articulate.

Around noon, he walked down to the beach. Albus Dumbledore was there, sitting in the sand at the edge of the water, reading a magazine. He was wearing a white linen shirt and offensively vibrant swimming trunks.

"Hello, Harry," said Dumbledore, looking up. "I trust you had an educational year at Hogwarts?"

"For the most part," said Harry. He folded his legs and sank into the sand beside the great wizard. "What are we doing about Voldemort?"

Dumbledore lowered the magazine and looked out over the beautiful turquoise water. "All that can be done, Harry."

He knew Dumbledore well enough to interpret that as a polite version of I don't want to talk about this. So, he switched gears. "How do I become a great wizard?"

Dumbledore looked at him, then. He looked… intrigued. "I would say, Harry, that you would do well to consider how you might become a great person as opposed to a great wizard. The two are not so different, when all is said and done. Often greatness is measured in the parsimony of our actions. I have always found that the more I come to understand powerful magic, the more loath I am to use it carelessly."

Harry shook his head. "Well, then how do you come to understand magic? I mean really understand it. There's a moment. An insight, or a series of them. I can almost taste it. But it's like I'm seeing my way around a blind spot."

And he told Dumbledore about his transfiguration of the glass bowl into the matryoshka dolls. The feeling of it, the sense of being on a precipice, knowing he'd done something important, but not understanding it.

"… and I could tell, even as it was happening, that it wasn't anything I could replicate. There was something extra in the transfiguration, something that I didn't put there."

Dumbledore listened, not interrupting Harry once, and when Harry finished, he braced himself with his arms, digging them into the sand as he leaned back. It was an incongruous image, quite at odds with the wise old wizard Harry knew.

"I see," said Dumbledore, and his stare had a curious depth to it. "You have indeed struck close to a truth that many wizards never grasp. Alas, this is a path you must walk alone. It is a thing not learned in books, not able to be told, only shown, and even then, only shown the beginning, the door, the origin. Observe."

Dumbledore drew up his knees and pulled out his wand. As he did, his shorts rode up a little.

"Gah!" said Harry, cringing away. "What the hell is that?" He was pointing at Dumbledore's knee, which was a ruin of scar tissue in the form of a twisted series of interconnected lines.

"Oh, that?" said Dumbledore. "Merely an old scar, albeit an exceedingly useful one." He sighed. "Or, it was, before my… displacement." He shook his head. "Now, attend."

Dumbledore waved his wand, the motion anything but precise, and a patch of sand next to them started swirling and rising. Towers jutted up from the ground, and a mass in the center rose into a roof, and large blocks started piling on top of themselves, and in a just a few moments, a miniature replica of Hogwarts sat next to them – the most impressive sand castle Harry had ever seen.

Harry scooted forward, his eyes widening. The detail was perfect. At the top of Gryffindor tower, flags made of sand waved gently back and forth in a non-existent breeze.

"Impressive," he said. That was an understatement. He looked closer. The doors to the Great Hall were open. Harry got on his knees and ducked his head, and looked through the doors. So small he could barely see them, the sand-tables of the Great Hall had sand-silverware and sand-goblets on them.

"How are you doing this?" said Harry, his voice strangled as he tried to work it out. "This isn't… I mean, did you transfigure the sand? But, there are moving parts, and the detail… is that Mrs. Norris? That has to be at least a dozen separate animation charms, not to mention the fact that the sand has to be held together magically…"

Dumbledore just let him go on, eyes sparkling merrily. "Indeed. And your answer…? You saw me wave my wand but once, and not with a well-practiced motion."

"It… wasn't a spell?" asked Harry doubtfully. "But, of course it was. It wasn't a specific spell, then. It was… something general. But the detail. I mean, you can't know all of that. It has to come from somewhere…" he trailed off, and pounded the sand in frustration. He felt like there was an answer, like it should be obvious, and he wasn't anywhere close to coming up with it. "Just tell me," he said, slumping.

Dumbledore looked like he was enjoying himself far too much. "I apologize, Harry. The insight must be yours alone."

"Can you at least give me a hint?"

"Of course, Harry," said Dumbledore, his beard twitching. "What kind of wise old teacher would I be if I were unable to dispense inscrutable advice?" He saw Harry's expression, and sighed. "All jesting aside, Harry, it is truly something you must come to on your own. And, if I may be so bold, something with which you need not concern yourself at your young age."

"You did," said Harry. He couldn't help it. The words came out just a bit resentful. "You had your insight at my age. You were doing great things before you even took your O.W.L.s."

"All people are different, unique in their own way," said Dumbledore quietly. "I am not you, and you are not me. And in truth, I believe in time you will be shown to be the better man."

A moment passed between them, and Harry shivered, for no reason he could name.

"As to your inscrutable advice," said Dumbledore, brightening considerably, "ponder the following: symbols and concepts exist, not just in our minds, but in magic itself. They have power and weight, real and measurable and true."

He straightened up, his voice taking on the cadence of a lecture.

"Hogwarts was my home, once," he said, pointing to the castle with his wand and looking a bit wistful. "For many, many years. It is a place I know intimately and love deeply. It means more to me than simply what it is: it represents something. I know it well, I understand it."

Harry felt like he was straining at a barrier he couldn't touch, couldn't see.

"Symbols have magical weight," continued Dumbledore. "Love, bravery, despair – for Muggles, these exist only inside themselves. They are subjective. A man stops a robbery and is rewarded – some see bravery, some see folly, some see opportunism. Each has their own perspective, to interpret as they choose. But for us, bravery is real. The Sword of Gryffindor must be taken under conditions of bravery. It cannot be tricked, it cannot be subverted, and it is not open to interpretation."

Dumbledore waved his wand again, and the castle fell in on itself, the towers collapsed, and the sand was simply sand again. "Understanding the magically symbolic is the first step on the road to being able to make use of it. And all powerful magic is rooted in symbolism." He stood up, brushing the sand off his legs. "Of course, such understanding is useless without a thorough and comprehensive grounding in magical theory." He chuckled. "Sooner or later, we must all do our homework."

Harry felt a headache coming on, but he forged ahead. "And what would you suggest, homework-wise?"

Dumbledore hummed. "I rather think that, given your skills, you would find it quite beneficial to master a single spell nonverbally. Such deep understanding of a spell will let you stretch the limits of what it may accomplish." His tone became just a bit too casual. "Professor Snape would be a valuable asset in this endeavor."

"Great," said Harry.

"It is indeed fortuitous that you have access to such teachers," said Dumbledore solemnly.

"Just great."

"If you require some incentive, Harry," said Dumbledore, turning to Harry and finally letting a bit of a mischievous smile shine through, "it would also be quite helpful for your development to tackle something advanced and complex, something that would require you to draw connections between several different areas of magical theory. I believe an attempt at the Portus spell would serve you well. And, assuming you make progress with Professor Snape, I would deign to instruct you myself."

"Really?" asked Harry, his enthusiasm suddenly ramping up.

"Really," replied Dumbledore.

"So, play nice with Snape and you'll teach me something fancy, huh?"

"A regrettable, if accurate phrasing."

"Deal."

And two weeks later, Harry was heartily regretting it. Snape had sneered at the idea of teaching someone Harry's age nonverbal magic. Harry had chosen Aresto Momentum, figuring that the days spent drilling it into him at Quidditch Camp had made it almost second-nature, and would give him a leg up.

It didn't. Or, if it did, it just made it like beating his head against a slightly more comfortable brick wall. Snape seemed to take a kind of sadistic joy in Harry's every failure. And when Harry had finally accomplished it – once, and barely – Snape had immediately moved on to casting it under what he called "practical conditions," which consisted of levitating Harry ten feet above the sand and dropping him.

Harry took what he considered to be a well-deserved day off on the first of July. He wrote to Fleur, sending Hedwig off with a letter suggesting they meet in London shortly after Harry's birthday. He made a decadent lunch and shared it with no one. He wandered around the main house, and when he heard Nicolas at work in his laboratory, he decided to pay the ancient alchemist a visit.

Nicolas Flamel was stooped over a worktable and muttering to himself in an ancient, forgotten language, but he looked younger than Dumbledore. He wore a sedate, even drab robe of dark brown, and his hair was salt-and-pepper. He had a bit of a paunch that pushed against the table as he worked. For all appearances, he could have been a midlevel manager of a furniture company, or something equally as nondescript, instead of one of the most venerated wizards of all time.

"And what brings you to my lair, Harry?" asked Nicolas without turning around.

Harry moved beside him. Nicolas was working on some bizarre apparatus – a series of lenses, at least a dozen, all suspended and oriented around a stand with a fist-sized gemstone on it. As Flamel changed the position of the lenses, the color of the gem shifted from a dark ruby to a light amethyst.

"Taking a break from Snape's insanity," he said.

"A noble goal," said Flamel. "And what are you subjecting yourself to that odious man for in the first place?" He still hadn't looked around, apparently deeply focused on the movement of the lenses.

"Dumbledore thought it was a good idea," said Harry, shrugging.

"As if that were reason enough." The man's voice had a dry, placid quality to it that could nonetheless be quite cutting when he chose.

"I have to be ready."

"Do you, I wonder?" Flamel adjusted one of the smaller lenses, tightening a knob on the side, and the gem… shimmered. It started to glow with a faint, intermittent inner light.

"Of course I do," said Harry, his brow furrowing. "I have to be ready for Voldemort. We have to be ready. It all depends on us."

Flamel sighed. "I will tell you a secret, Harry Potter. I have seen more Dark Lords rise than you've seen birthdays, so believe me when I tell you that no, it does not." He finally swung his gaze over to Harry. "Voldemort is an evil man, and powerful, and not a foe to take lightly. But the world does not rest on our shoulders. You may defeat Voldemort, or you may not. But he will be defeated."

"That's a remarkably blasé attitude."

"One that I have earned from many, many seasons." The alchemist turned back to the lenses. The gem was flickering rapidly now, and a quick readjustment turned the flicker into a steady glow. "Tell me, Harry Potter. Do you know the phrase ēthos anthrōpōi daimōn?"

"Can't say that I do."

"A pity. Greece, as a home, was not chosen at random. The Greeks taught us much, and they have lessons still to teach. Lessons that should not go unheard." He stepped away from the bench, still talking, but moving from side to side, looking at the gem from different angles. "Zosimos of Panopolis was one of the first alchemists, you know. He was a Gnostic, and he had some strange ideas about fallen angels, but he understood the song of the elements."

"I'm not sure I – "

"It means 'character is destiny'," said Flamel, running right over him. "Or 'character is fate' might be a better translation. Fate, destiny... both are too narrow and too broad at the same time. And, for that matter, 'character' isn't quite right either. English doesn't quite have the right words for the concepts involved. But I digress. In the magical world, it's a simple truth. Your character informs your Patronus, colors your spellcasting, even chooses your House at that school of yours. But it's more than that – it's a way of looking at things. It means that you create the reality you know. You are what you seek to know about yourself. Do you understand what I mean, then, when I say that Voldemort can't help but fail?"

Harry thought about it. "You mean that his character makes it impossible for him to win, because he's evil and violent and doesn't trust anyone, so winning for him doesn't have a realistic definition."

"You have the essence of it, I think," said Flamel approvingly. "What I mean is this: Voldemort's character is uncompromising. His goals are the kind of goals that must ever come into conflict with others. No matter how skilled he is, no matter how many times he wins, he will always find opposition. And, because his only response to opposition is to destroy it, he will fail eventually. It is inevitable. It might not be you, and it might not be for a century, but Voldemort's dream is incompatible with reality, and his character will continue to grind against it until he is dust, and he will never seek to adapt or reconcile or merge. He will simply continue on, like a bad cough, until the world spits out a remedy."

Neither can live while the other survives, thought Harry, and shivered. He'd never known the weight of the phrase 'someone just stepped over my grave' until that exact moment.

"I guess I see your point," said Harry. "It's kind of hard to take the long view, though, when it's me in the crosshairs at this particular moment."

"An understandable perspective," said Flamel calmly. "There may come a day, however, when you may take comfort in the long view, the one where Voldemort cannot possibly win. It may be a cold comfort, but it might well bring you peace of mind."

And wasn't that a cheerful thought? "Thanks, I guess," said Harry. He turned to leave. Flamel's hands moved over the lenses, and he didn't look up, his attention fully committed.

It took a fifteen-minute walk along the beach to bring Harry some equanimity, but it came, albeit slowly. To know the thing looming in the distance was aimed at you, to know it was coming, but not when, or where, but to sense its inevitability… it was unsettling. Gradually, Harry processed it as he walked.

In contrast, when his epiphany struck, it came like a bolt from the blue.

He ran back, covering the same distance in two minutes, and stormed into the main house, almost panting, completely out of breath.

"Sirius, Remus," he gasped as he staggered into the kitchen. "I have an idea."

Sirius was making lunch for the both of them. He was in the middle of constructing a sandwich that was almost as tall as it was wide. He looked up. "Harry? What is it?"

Remus was quicker on the draw, and he stood, going to the sink and running a glass of water. "What's wrong, Harry?"

"Voldemort," said Harry, "we have to do something about him."

Sirius and Remus exchanged a glance.

"We're aware," said Sirius.

"No, I mean now," said Harry. "We have to change the game. We've been reacting, always reacting. Tracking rumors, trying to see what he'll plan, anticipate his moves. Well, screw that. His character, see, he's built that way. We'll never get ahead of the game. It's destiny."

"Harry, slow down," said Remus.

Harry took a breath. He calmed down. "We've been passive. We need to be active. It's in his nature, you see. Conflict. He'll always attack. He can't not."

"We can't attack Voldemort if we don't know where he is," said Remus. "That's what this whole thing has been about."

"We don't need to know where he is," said Harry. "We need to set up a situation where he'll come to us."

"Harry…" said Sirius, his voice a warning.

"No, I mean it," said Harry. "Even if there are ten reasons it's the wrong thing, we need to do something, because anything is better than waiting for him to do something and then reacting to it. We need to give him a target he can't help but strike."

Sirius looked like he was about to snap something overprotective and unreasonable, but Remus stilled him with a hand. "What kind of target are you talking about, Harry?" he asked.

"Well, as to that, I have an idea," said Harry, a grin slowly taking over his face. And he told them.

Author's Note: This was a tough chapter to write - the words just weren't flowing when I sat down to work on it, for whatever reason. Temporary writer's block lasted a couple weeks, and then I got back on the horse.

One of the things that probably contributed to that is that this is a transitional chapter. It's a compromise between slice of life stuff and keeping the pace ticking along. Originally this was supposed to cover the whole summer with a nice Fleur interlude, but it started running long and I had to cut things off here.

Year 3 is where things ratchet up, stakes-wise, and the whole "main plot" starts moving from the background to the foreground.

A/N: If you need a quick refresher on previous chapters, a summary for the story so far can be found in my profile.

Chapter 9 – Blood on the Table

The Ionian Sea was glittering and picturesque even when inverted and flying at high speed hundreds of feet above it.

Harry, on his trusty Nimbus Two-Thousand, kept pace with Hedwig as she dipped her wing and turned sharply. The owl couldn't match him for sheer acceleration, but she was graceful and quick, even for a messenger owl.

The two of them tore through the sky over the Flamels' island, chasing a mouse with dragonfly wings.

The mouse didn't seem to be quite sure how to use the wings correctly, which made it dance through the air like a drunken housefly, but that suited Harry just fine. He made a wild grab for it as it zipped across his field of vision, the dragonfly wings glinting in the full light of the afternoon. He felt his fingertips catch on the mouse's wiggly pink tail for a quarter-second, and then it slipped through.

Hedwig let out a staccato bark that sounded remarkably like laughter as she arced up, with a powerful, deceptively slow beat of her wings, and snagged the mouse in her talons.

"Outflown by an owl, huh? That can't feel good." Sirius had to yell from the beach, but even his cupped hands couldn't hide his grin.

Harry gave him the finger as he swerved his broom around, wrenching it to a stop.

"You sure you don't want to do something actually fun for your birthday?" called Sirius. "Maybe go for a swim?"

"Maybe later," said Harry distractedly, as he twisted around on the broom, shading his eyes and trying to spot Hedwig against the glare of the sun.

"I was thinking more along the lines of right now," yelled Sirius.

Harry turned his head back towards the beach. "What do you mean by – " Harry was cut off mid-sentence as the brilliant grey light of the Banisher filled his vision, and he was propelled off his broom.

The world spun; he felt a rush of air and saw a vast expanse of rapidly approaching blue-green ocean underneath him. His heart clenched painfully in his chest as the wind whipped at his clothes. The world was a rush of color until a spike of adrenaline clarified things and he wrenched his wand loose from the holster he now wore constantly.

He flicked it sharply. Arresto Momentum. The thought, this time, was different. He'd been practicing the spell nonverbally for the entire summer, and it had always been a clear, voice-in-his-head monotone. This time, for whatever reason, it was less defined, more diffuse – but at the same time more familiar. Intimate, almost.

So enraptured was Harry with the feeling of the spell that he barely noticed himself slow down in midair, the ocean approaching at a more sedate pace.

It was impossible to describe. He mentally flipped through figurative language – casting the spell had been like a frozen cloud, a thousand swirling possibilities crystallized into one shape, defined by purpose, defined by knowledge, defined by –

Of course, Sirius chose that moment to hit him with a Finite.

Harry dropped the rest of the way under gravity's own particular brand of magic, a full twenty feet, and plunged into the Ionian Sea. He came up sputtering, still clutching his wand. He struggled for a second, then started paddling towards the shore. After a half-minute of hard work, his feet touched sand.

"Sirius, you absolute twat," said Harry, scowling at his godfather as he dragged himself out of the ocean, his clothes heavy and wet against his skin.

Sirius was on his knees in the sand, clutching his ribs and cackling loudly. "Your face," he gasped. "You looked so stupid when I hit you with that second one. Bloody priceless."

"About that," said Harry, as he waved his wand over his clothes, drying himself, paying special attention to the leather holster. "I was right in the middle of a magical epiphany, and you ruined it. I'm afraid you're going to have to be punished quite severely for that." He raised his arm, pointing his wand at Sirius.

"Is that right?" said Sirius, getting to his feet. He was still grinning hugely. He held his own wand loosely at his side. "Let's see if all the work this summer paid off."

Harry paused. The timing on this was going to be crucial. He took a deliberate, measured step to the side, then made a whip-crack motion with his wand, muttering a spell under his breath.

The blue jet of light passed harmlessly over Sirius's left shoulder.

Sirius leaned out of the way reflexively, then shook his head. "We're going to have to work on your aim, Harry, if that's the best you can do."

Crossing his arms, Harry just grinned at him.

Sirius frowned. "What are you smiling at?" His eyes widened fractionally. "Oh, shi –"

He had just enough time to turn and get a face-full of feathers as a panda-sized Hedwig knocked him over like a bowling pin. Sirius went down in a tangle of arms and legs, his head half-buried in the sand.

"HOOT!" Hedwig's loud cry was almost ecstatic as she swooped away, her wings casting a huge shadow on the ground.

This time it was Harry's turn to sink into the sand and collapse with laughter.

Sirius spat out a mouthful of sand as he got to his feet. "That's not fair," he said, managing to look half his age with the sheer weight of his petulant expression.

Harry was too busy laughing to answer. When Hedwig landed next to him (with a noticeable thump of displaced sand), it took a few tries to say Reducio around his chuckles.

Ignoring Sirius for the moment, Harry looked at Hedwig speculatively, reaching out and nudging her wing for a modified high-five. "You want another go, Hedwig?" She hooted affirmatively. "All right. I'll sit this one out, I think."

Harry flicked his wand and Summoned a stone from the edge of the beach. Working quickly, he transfigured it into a mouse, this time adding sparrow wings for novelty's sake.

As he worked, his mind wandered back into abstraction. It was strange, when he thought about it. Mice didn't know how to use wings. Harry didn't know how to use wings. The knowledge was coming from somewhere, or the thing wouldn't be able to fly at all. Granted, Hedwig's flying snacks didn't fly particularly well, but they flew.

Again, that feeling of almost, but not quite reaching an insight tickled at his brain. Shrugging it off, he turned to Hedwig as he completed the transfiguration.

"Don't fill up on empty calories," he said. He nudged her. "Get it?" Hedwig just stared at him. The mouse-bird zipped into the air, and Hedwig took off, chasing it.

"Well, I thought it was funny," said Harry, stowing his wand.

Sirius came up beside him, still brushing sand out of his clothes. They both craned their heads and looked into the sky, watching Harry's owl chase an anatomically impossible flying mouse.

"You're getting better," said Sirius eventually. He turned to Harry. "I was kidding around, before, but you're improving a lot."

"Am I?" said Harry. His voice dropped a little. "It doesn't feel like it, sometimes."

"Hell, Harry," said Sirius, turning to look at him, "you're doing things with a wand I didn't even consider until I was out of Hogwarts. You could probably breeze through the practical parts of the O.W.L.s right now. Don't worry so much."

"I can't help it, though." Harry sat down heavily on the sand, and Sirius joined him. He looked out at the water. "It's a lot of pressure, you know? You all assume if I keep working at this, I'll turn into Dumbledore. That if I keep going, it'll just click for me. But you said it didn't click for my mum until she was finished with Hogwarts. I don't have that kind of time, Sirius. And… and what if it never does? What if I'm just good, not great?"

The words felt almost dragged out – it was an effort to voice them. It was a secret fear, something Harry rarely admitted to himself.

"Then you won't be as great as Albus Dumbledore," said Sirius ruefully, drawing his knees up and leaning forward. He shook out his long, dark hair and showered the beach with a light dusting of sand. "Join the club. Membership is limited to pretty much the entire wizarding world."

Harry sighed. "I know it seems arrogant. I know I have a lot of advantages. I work hard, but it's not like everyone else gets private lessons from people like Albus and Nicolas. And Snape, I suppose." That last bit came somewhat grudgingly. "It's just… it's about potential, I guess. I just want to live up to… well, everything."

Sirius gave him a guarded look. "I'm starting to think Remus and I did you a disservice by talking so much about how amazing your parents were." On Harry's scowl, he backpedaled. "No, no, don't get me wrong. They were great, wonderful people. James was my best friend. Lily was a dream. But they certainly weren't perfect, either of them."

"I know they were real people, Sirius. Not statues."

"I just mean…" Sirius scrubbed a hand through his hair. "I'm so bad at this," he mumbled to himself. "I mean, listen, just because Lily may have been on a path to play in Dumbledore and Voldemort's league, maybe, with another few decades of experience, doesn't mean you should stress about not getting there on your thirteenth birthday. Happy birthday, by the way."

"Thanks," said Harry. He let his head rest on his knees and thought about it. He felt better, but Sirius didn't quite get it. The root of his insecurity didn't have so much to do with the fact that he wasn't moving fast enough, it was more about the question of getting there at all. Sirius and the others acted like if he just avoided making any mistakes, avoided limiting himself, he'd get there. But it wasn't that certain, not at all. If it were that simple, Albus Dumbledores would be much more common.

"Are you having second thoughts about the plan?" asked Sirius. He was looking at Harry carefully – probably, thought Harry, reading some of the worry there and misinterpreting it.

"No. The plan's good. And it's too late to change it now, anyway. Nicolas left this morning."

"It's risky," said Sirius. "Aberforth and Snape will be the only ones in a position to help, and, well, I'm not thrilled with that."

"I'm aware," said Harry dryly.

"Remus and I don't exactly have easy access to Britain. And Dumbledore… well, if he even puts a toe on British soil, he triggers an alarm at the Ministry so loud they'll think it's an air raid."

"I know, Sirius. It was my plan, mostly."

"That's what scares me, Harry. It's a Sirius Black kind of plan – it's risky and it puts other people in unknowing danger."

"It'll be fine. I'm not worried."

"Then what is it?" asked Sirius. He nudged Harry's shoulder. "Is it your little excursion to Diagon Alley?" He grinned. "Because I have to say, if you were going to be nervous about something…"

"You can go ahead and shut all the way up about that."

Harry got to his feet and Sirius followed. They made their way back to the house. It was a modern thing, all sharp angles and glass surfaces. Remus waved to them from the deck overlooking the beach. He was hunched over a wicker chair, reading a book and looking miserable. He had an empty ice bucket beside the chair, and his hand kept hovering towards it. The days near the full moon were never kind to werewolves.

Inside the house, Harry found Dumbledore and Nicolas deep in conversation.

"Ah, excellent timing, Harry," said Dumbledore. "Nicolas returned no more than a minute ago."

"How'd it go?" asked Harry, retrieving a bottle of water from the kitchen. Flying was thirsty work.

"About like you'd expect," said Nicolas. He reached into his ornate robes – they looked odd on him; he hardly ever dressed up – and pulled out a blood-red stone, tossing it carelessly on the kitchen counter. "I met with the French Ministry – both the Minister and the head of La Sûreté Nationale – in secret, taking every possible precaution to make the meeting private. I therefore expect news of the meeting to leak by the end of the day."

Dumbledore smiled softly. "I take it, old friend, that they were not receptive to your request?"

"No, they were not," said Flamel, smirking. "Seemed to think keeping the Stone locked up in their vaults would make them a target. Very uncharitable of them, especially after I took the time to put on a proper display of paranoia befitting a crazy old codger such as myself."

"I hope you were circumspect about your fears, Nicolas," said Dumbledore.

"What do you take me for?" said Nicolas, scoffing. "I was extremely vague. I even muttered about how the darkness was rising. You would have been proud, Albus."

"I can't tell which of you is the bad influence on the other one," said Harry.

"Both of them are, I think," said Sirius.

The four of them stood over the marble counter, looking down at the blood-red stone.

"It's remarkably realistic," said Dumbledore, peering at it closely.

"It didn't have to be," said Flamel. "Not many know what it really looks like, after all. But, still, a man has his standards."

"And the enchantments?" asked Harry, hovering a finger over the surface, not touching it, straining to listen in that particular way Dumbledore had taught him. He felt nothing, though. It might have been an ordinary stone.

"Undetectable, and quite long-lasting," said Dumbledore modestly. "A very neat bit of spellwork, if I do say so myself."

"I guess we're on, then," said Harry, straightening up. He felt a little thrill go through him. It had been his plan, after all. Changed, strengthened, solidified by the experience of the adults, but the idea was his. Today, they took the first steps in taking the fight to Voldemort.

"Indeed," said Dumbledore. He had a faraway look in his eyes, and didn't sound altogether happy at the declaration. He roused himself, looking at Harry. "On to more immediate concerns, then. Did you succeed in your task, Harry?"

For a moment, Harry blanked on what Dumbledore was talking about – his mind was casting about in the uncertain future, but Dumbledore's words snapped him back to the here and now. "I think so. I want you to check it, of course."

Dumbledore nodded, waving for him to proceed. Harry jogged to his room, where a large bookshelf and a messy desk dominated the floor space. There was no bed – Harry still used the wardrobe to commute to England every night, sleeping at the Dursleys – so it was more of a study than a room, but even so, it was his.

He grabbed an innocuous-looking ballpoint pen off the desk and held it up to his eye, inspecting it. Satisfied, he walked back to the kitchen and set it on the counter next to Flamel's imitation Stone.

Dumbledore drew his wand and waved it over the pen, muttering. The air rustled faintly with the power of the whispered spells. "Fascinating," he said, straightening up. "And acceptable, for the most part. The target destination in Diagon Alley is a bit ill-defined, and the return destination of the Dursleys is a bit weak, but the portion of the Portkey dealing with adverse momentum and inertial compensation is exemplary."

"Yeah," said Harry, shrugging. "Ever since I started practicing Arresto Momentum nonverbally, all of the movement-based magic I do seems to be a bit easier."

"Interesting how that works out, isn't it?" said Dumbledore, his benign expression betraying just a hint of a smile.

"Do you get some sort of secret pleasure out of watching me flounder around in the dark?" asked Harry, swiping the pen off the counter perhaps harder than he strictly needed to.

"There's nothing particularly secret about it, Harry," said Dumbledore. He nodded at the pen. "I deem that Portkey acceptable. Your technique could use refinement, but it is a remarkable accomplishment nonetheless. Have a care, when you use it, not to draw attention to yourself. Illegal use of a Portkey would be quite a convenient opportunity for the Ministry to detain you. I suspect you would find the experience unpleasant."

"I suspect I would," said Harry. That was a wrinkle he hadn't considered. The Ministry was too easy to think of as this vague, nebulous entity.

"I guess you're all set, then," said Sirius. "Be home for dinner. Remus baked a cake and everything."

Harry arched an eyebrow. "Remus isn't in any shape to bake anything right now. Don't you mean you baked a cake?"

"Well," said Sirius guiltily, "most of the way. It's not exactly a cake, yet. But I can fix it! I've been meaning to work on my inedible-to-edible transfiguration anyway."

Sadly, thought Harry a few minutes later as he was picking his way through the wardrobe and back to England, Sirius was only joking a little bit.



* * *



Diagon Alley was bursting with activity. A month before Hogwarts started up again seemed to be the sweet spot, and within seconds of arriving, Harry had to duck out of the way of a witch using her wand to direct two prams, each with a squalling infant inside, down the street.

He oriented himself. Rows of shops with vibrant signs. The chatter of a crowd. The familiar twitch of heads as he moved through the throng of people as someone recognized him, then did a double-take. He moved with purpose. He heard someone calling his name – there was Neville Longbottom coming out of Madam Malkin's, carrying a stack of new robes and trailing his grandmother, who wore an absurd stuffed vulture hat. He gave Neville a wave back. And there, down the street, was Hagrid, moving away and towards the Leaky Cauldron, easy to spot both for his height and for the ripples in the crowd he left in his wake, like a boat cutting through the water.

Harry started towards Ollivander's. He checked his watch. He still had a few minutes before he was supposed to meet Fleur. He was excited to see her, and more than a little nervous. They hadn't seen each other in a year, after all, and when it came right down to it, they'd never even had a proper conversation.

Then, a welcome distraction from his nerves – he'd just passed the polished marble façade of Gringotts when he heard his name.

"Hey, Harry! Over here!"

Turning, moving out of the crowd and onto the steps of Gringotts, Harry saw Fred and George Weasley approaching, waving cheerfully.

"What brings to you Diagon Alley this fine day, Harry?" asked George as they closed the distance. Fred didn't say anything, and seemed to be preoccupied with trying to find a comfortable way to carry a smallish cauldron that was stuffed with books.

"Meeting a friend for lunch," said Harry.

"Not school shopping, then?" said Fred, finally just hefting the cauldron under his arm like a barrel. "Bully for you. It's so crowded today we've been at it for hours. Though that little dust-up in the bookstore didn't help."

"Dust-up?" said Harry.

"Yeah," said George, smirking. "Dad got into it with Lucius Malfoy. Bloody brilliant, it was. Knocked him flat. Granted, dad got a split lip out of the deal, but it was worth it just to see that wanker's hair fly around."

"Poor Ginny," said Fred solemnly. "I bet she was expecting her very first Hogwarts shopping trip to involve a little less punching and a little more childlike wonder."

"Percy wasn't happy about it either," said George. "He's gunning for Head Boy next year, by the way. Try to act really surprised when he won't shut up about being a prefect. We've been having fun with that all summer."

"Will do," said Harry.

"So, Harry, about Quidditch this year. Do you think we…?" Fred's voice trailed off. He was looking over Harry's shoulder and blinking repeatedly, his eyes going wide.

Harry turned to George, intending to ask him what was the matter, only to find the other Weasley twin in a similar state – he was focused on something behind Harry, staring and stunned into silence.

He spun on his heel, and Fleur was there. She was beaming. She hadn't changed much in the year since he'd seen her last – she was still willowy, and blonde, and her hair did interesting things in the slight breeze. Harry had grown, though, and they were exactly the same height now. He reached for words, found none, felt a moment of panic – and then, luckily, she spoke first.

"Hello, 'Arry," she said. She really had a dazzling smile, thought Harry. There was no other word for it. She approached almost hesitantly, coming to a stop a few feet in front of him. "Thank you for meeting me here." Her accent was noticeable, but not thick, and she laid a deliberate weight on the words, as if she were marking them carefully. "You see? I have been working hard."

Harry smiled back. It seemed to be a very natural response, like looking up and taking a deep breath after stepping outside into the sun. "It shows. You barely have an accent."

Fleur waved that away with a graceful flick of the wrist. "I practiced that sentence in particular," she said. "Normally eet is not so smooth." She quirked an eyebrow, a grin and a hint of a challenge – the same exact expression he remembered from Quidditch Camp, when she'd provoked him into continuing their race. "And you? Have you been practicing as well?"

The abrupt shift in languages threw Harry a bit, but he quickly recovered, slipping into a well-practiced sentence. "I'll have you know that I spent an hour each day for the last month studying with a woman who's been speaking the language for over five hundred years," he said, in what he hoped was passable French.

Fleur laughed. It sounded like bells, somehow. "Not bad, 'Arry. You made a mistake with the numbers, though. You meant 'fifty,' no? That would be cinquante."

"How silly of me," said Harry. "Of course, fifty. I certainly don't know a woman who's over five hundred years old." Fleur looked at him in confusion and he just managed to keep a straight face.

Something sharp and rapid poked his shoulder. He turned, and Fred and George were shooting him dirty looks, giving him clear 'introduce us' hand signals. Harry rolled his eyes and gestured them forward.

"Fleur, this is George or Fred Weasley, and his brother, the other one. They go to Hogwarts with me. They're, uh, friends, I guess."

Fred elbowed his way forward. "Mentors, really. More mature. Taught him everything he knows, we did."

"Did you really?" she murmured, her big blue eyes flicking between them. She looked completely disarming.

"Nearly everything. Well, mostly everything. Some things?" Fred was practically tripping over his words. George winced, and started to give his brother a discreet 'wrap it up' hand signal.

"Yes, they taught me quite a lot. Like how to make a graceful exit," said Harry. "Speaking of which, how about that lunch, Fleur?"

"We'd be happy to join you!" said Fred, with what Harry thought a most unbecoming note of desperation.

"But we just had lunch," said George. Fred kicked his ankle discreetly. "I mean, we'd love to join you."

"I'm sure you'd find it terribly boring," said Harry, a bit too quickly. "We're mostly going to talk about wands. Wand maintenance, actually. How to properly document wand upkeep. Boring stuff, you'd hate it. Uh, let's go, Fleur."

She nodded, he gestured, and together they walked down Diagon Alley. Harry glanced over his shoulder as they moved away and saw Fred and George wearing identical looks of sputtering disbelief.

They didn't have much of a problem moving through the crowd, this time. Harry was used to large groups marking his presence – he'd had plenty of practice in his early days at Hogwarts – and he was detached and comfortable enough with it that it was almost fascinating, like watching the movement of tree branches on a gusty day. People would pause for a second, either recognizing Harry or simply struck for a moment by Fleur's singular beauty, and nearby, other people would react to that pause, and find the source of it, and the ripples would continue. If it bothered Fleur at all, she didn't show it. They walked together, side by side, Fleur close enough that Harry noticed it, and paid attention to it, and was distracted by it.

"There's a little café a few minutes' walk into Muggle London," she said blithely as they passed Flourish and Blotts. "I was lucky to find it. So much of your English food is quite… uninspiring."

"Works for me," said Harry. "You're the one who's been living here for months. You probably know the area better than I do."

"Well, that is not entirely true," said Fleur. "I travel to Mr. Ollivander's shop every day, with the Floo, and then back to France at night. My family allows me a great deal of…" she seemed to pause on the word, "lassitude? Is zat correct?"

"Latitude? Leeway? Liberty? Laissez-faire?"

"Yes, those," she said. She cocked her head for a moment, the curtain of her silvery-blonde hair falling over her shoulder with the movement. "Leeway, I think. My family allows me a great deal of leeway, but even so, zey would not let me spend the summer in London alone."

Harry smirked. "Yeah, can't say that I have much experience with that. My family goes the other way. They definitely wouldn't be worried about me spending time on my own and running into trouble."

"Oh, you misunderstand. They seemed to think zat I would be the one causing trouble." She had such a wide-eyed look of incredulity that Harry couldn't quite decide if she was just making a very dry joke, or if she simply had that pure, honest arrogance that came from self-sure blindness.

Harry shook his head ruefully and pulled out his wand, tapping the bricks. A brisk walk through the Leaky Cauldron – Fleur pausing to sniff haughtily at the grubby countertops – and they were in Muggle London. It was one of London's more picturesque summer days, and it was pleasant to walk down the open streets and listen to the sounds of the city. Fleur led the way, and they talked of inconsequential things, of Hogwarts and Beuxbatons, of tests and broomsticks, of wands and weather. She was animated, and she talked with her hands, just like Harry remembered. They walked, slowly and meanderingly, in no particular hurry, the short distance to the café.

It was small and charming and quaint, with a red awning and wrought-iron tables outside. Harry ordered an iced tea, and Fleur, thumbing her nose at the heat, ordered a coffee, and they did a short, complicated little dance where they both tried to pay, and the girl at the counter glanced at Fleur and had one of those female-to-female moments that Harry was just now beginning to realize happened all the time, right under his nose.

They sat outside. It was sunny and warm.

Harry sipped his iced tea. "So why are you so interested in wands?"

Fleur took her cup and held it in her hands, blowing delicately on the foamy surface of the coffee. "I do not know exactly 'ow to answer that question." Harry was studying her closely – it was important question, after all – but he found himself, for some odd reason, paying attention to the way her fingers curled elegantly around the cup.

"It's not a path many choose," said Harry. "There are, what, a dozen reputable wandmakers in the world?"

"Less than that. Five, six at most, if you count Madame Lefurgey in Paris. And I do not. Her wands 'ave a certain… temperamental quality that holds them back."

"And you want to be one of them."

"Yes." Fleur said it carelessly, as if it were simply a mundane fact. She looked for a second like that was all she was going to say, and then she leaned forward, looking at Harry intently. "It is my dream. My family name is not well known in my country. No one perks up when they hear it. My father works at a low-level job in our Ministry that he'll never be promoted from, and my mother is content in her life at home. Someday, though, I will craft such wands the likes of which the world 'as never seen. And when witches and wizards of high renown gather and rub shoulders, they will show them off proudly, and they will say, 'envy me, for I have a Delacour wand'."

Harry leaned back in his chair and took another drink of iced tea and looked at the girl sitting across from him, at her hard, imperious expression. She was wearing jeans so dark they were almost black, a blouse that hugged her shoulders only to flare out and be gathered up by a wide, tan belt, and a scarf loosely draped around her neck with casual elegance. For just a moment, Harry believed that if he closed his eyes and stretched out his hand, he'd be able to feel her ardent potential like he could feel magic.

"Admirable," said Harry. "To really know what you want to do, I mean. I would have thought you'd want to race brooms or play Quidditch professionally."

"Well," she said, smiling slightly, "I do enjoy flying quite a bit, as you know. Racing with you, and that dragon…" She looked off for a moment, wistful, her big blue eyes sparkling. "It was impressively fun." She shrugged. "But, as they say, qui court deux lievres a la fois, n'en prend aucun." The language shift was abrupt, and Harry struggled with the words for a moment in his head before coming up with something like who runs after two rabbits at the same time catches none.

"True," he said. "It just seems like a shame to be so single-minded. Trying new things can be fun."

"It was made clear to me by Mr. Ollivander that such dedication would be necessary," said Fleur. "As you said, it is not an easy path. I've already sacrificed a relationship on the altar of my goal."

"Oh?" said Harry, raising his eyebrow.

"Claude," she said. She flicked a wrist, a dismissive gesture. "A boyfriend. My first. He's one year above me at Beauxbatons, and a good flyer. Not as good as you, I zink."

"Very few are," said Harry modestly, holding his cup to his lips and hiding a grin.

"He was unable to 'andle the long summer apart, I'm afraid," she said. She shrugged. "It is not so great a loss, in the long run."

"How charitable of you," said Harry. "I don't suppose you'll find it all that difficult to replace him."

She sniffed. "Just because I can fish with a large net doesn't mean I like all kinds of fish."

"Is that another French saying?"

"It is a Fleur saying." She fixed him with a haughty, imperious look.

"You," said Harry, sounding almost pleased, "are a snob."

Fleur leaned forward, and her smile was slow and smoky. "What of it, 'Arry Potter?"

"Nothing. I kind of like it." Harry ruthlessly squashed the small part of his brain that pointed out that he didn't like Malfoy or Smith for almost the same reasons.

"Do you?"

"It's not boring," he said, and left it at that.

They drank their beverages, one hot, one cold, and eyed each other, and Harry found that sense of communication he'd felt back at Quidditch Camp, that sense of immediately getting each other with just a few words, or no words at all, was not lost now that words were added. It was simply there, a current running under their conversation with a low electric hum.

The door to the café jingled, and a woman stepped out. She was older, with flyaway hair, and was carrying a paper bag and had half a croissant stuffed in her mouth.

Fleur stopped her with a look, glancing up from the table. "Excusez-moi, would you mind, terribly, taking our picture?" Even as she spoke, Fleur reached behind her and, as if by magic, pulled out a small disposable camera.

"Of course," the woman said brightly, taking the camera.

"A picture?" said Harry, frowning.

"I'm documenting my time here in London," she said. "My sister is eager to see pictures of such an exotic land."

"She must not get out much," said Harry.

"Zis is true. She is, however, six." Fleur leaned forward slightly, inclined towards him, a lock of hair falling into her eyes at the movement. A quick, practiced motion swept it back over her shoulder.

"Like that's any excuse." Harry found himself leaning forward as well, matching her.

There was a click, and Harry turned. The woman had snapped a shot, mid-banter. "Oh, aren't you two adorable," she beamed. "That will turn out lovely, I'm sure." She held out the camera.

"I 'ave no doubt it will," said Fleur, taking it and slipping it behind her chair. "Thank you."

"Thanks," echoed Harry.

The woman favored him with a fond smile, and left.

Fleur and Harry looked at each other.

"Don't worry, I'll send you a copy," she said.

"Please do," said Harry. "You look pretty cute with a coffee foam mustache."

Her hands went to her face and her eyes went wide, and Harry laughed.



* * *



Arresto Momentum. Arresto Momentum. Arresto Momentum.

Harry stood on the beach, scowling and unmoving, flicking his wand. It was pointless. Whatever spark of intuition he'd felt when Sirius's ill-timed attack had shattered his concentration wasn't going to suddenly re-appear. And this, Dumbledore's advice, dry-firing a spell over and over like this, when he wasn't moving anyway, was beyond frustrating.

He was beginning to think that Dumbledore was just making it up as he went along.

Arresto Momentum. Arresto Momentum. Arresto Momentum.

He took a step forward, and it felt like moving through wet concrete. So the spell was working. But the spell, really, was about more than just slowing down. It was about controlling movement. Stabilizing. More than that, too, really. The spell was in the same family as the series of enchantments that made brooms fly, and the ones that made them controllable. So it wasn't blind. It was willful, it was about tweaking the rules of force and momentum and inertia.

Arresto…

And his thoughts became a little fuzzy, a little unfocused. Without really trying, he didn't think the words so much as flash them through his mind – not an inner voice, but an inner statement, a recitation of knowledge and a flash of inspiration both.

He jumped. For just a second, Harry felt pressure and movement and suddenly he was a few feet in the air, and then there was a confused moment where it seemed as if there were three separate forces acting on his legs, and then he dropped to the ground and fell into the sand.

"Very good, Harry."

"Gah!" If he hadn't been already in a heap on the sand, he would have fallen over with shock. Dumbledore was suddenly just there. "How do you do that? There's literally no place to hide on this beach, and it's so bright out I would have seen a Disillusionment Charm coming a mile away."

Dumbledore's expression was very, very dry as he said the obvious words. "Magic." He held up his hands as Harry opened his mouth angrily. "Would you deny an old man his favorite pastime, Harry?"

"What, messing with me?" Harry stood up and brushed off the sand.

"I simply wish to see the delight and inspiration on your face when you discover my method all on your own."

"I'm sure."

Dumbledore nodded, his expression turning serious, and he pointed to Harry's wand. "In any case, it seems you've had a bit of an insight."

"I have?"

"That last spell, Harry. It didn't do quite what it was supposed to, did it?"

"I lifted off the ground a bit. But that was an accident."

"And that, in the end, will make all the difference," said Dumbledore with an air of satisfaction.

"But…" Harry was close to actually stamping the ground in frustration, but then he remembered that he wasn't a six-year-old girl. "If I didn't do it on purpose, how can I learn anything from it?"

"Simple," said Dumbledore. "You must train yourself to do something accidentally on purpose."

Harry fixed him with a flat stare. "Accidentally on purpose."

"Yes," said Dumbledore cheerfully. "All you need to do is put yourself in the kind of mindset where it's possible to grasp an idea completely and yet pay no careful attention to it whatsoever. The kind of mindset, for example, where you would be capable of flying if you simply throw yourself at the ground and miss."

Harry counted to ten in his head, and took a deep breath. "Sirius never should have lent you those books."

"Quite possibly," said Dumbledore, still with that insufferably cheerful expression.

"And what kind of deranged lunatic is able to embrace a contradiction like that?" Dumbledore spread his arms and shrugged, which made the purple and lime robes with gold moons and stars on them shift fractionally. "Right, never mind."

"It is the rare individual for whom contradiction can be embraced, two conflicting ideas held not apart and never considered, like a coward would do, but clashing." Dumbledore's expression was quiet, now. "Magic makes hypocrites out of us all, Harry. We gain knowledge and say we are learning, but we blind ourselves as we go. To truly understand a spell is to narrow its focus and broaden it, at the same time. You must be an honest hypocrite, if you are to excel. Do not flinch from contradiction."

"I…" Harry took his wand and held it up. He looked at – really looked at it. The point was so narrow. Just a thin, tiny piece of wood. Just a single feather inside it. And yet it had a magic all its own, so deep and complex that masters spent their lives understanding wandcraft and still toiled in uncertain, reverent waters. "… I think I see."

"Then your moment of insight was not in vain," said Dumbledore quietly. "An important first step in a very long, very difficult journey."

Harry held his wand loosely but intently, and he tried to force his mind into the same configuration. Except forcing it was wrong. He took a deep breath. He thought about everything he knew about the spell – the theory, the linguistics, the long hours of practice. He thought about that wild rush of chaos that came from accidental magic – unformed, unguided, untethered. And then he thought about how those two things could exist together if he only bent his mind at right angles to reality.

Arresto Momentum, he thought/didn't think. Focused/unfocused. And the spell formed/didn't form.

Harry felt himself launched sideways, completely free of inertia, stationary one moment, moving the next, gliding over the sand at extreme speeds, until he clipped a small sand dune and found himself sprawled out on the ground again. That time, he felt the inertia.

He spat out a mouthful of sand, and grinned around it.

Harry didn't keep the grin, but he felt light and happy for the rest of the day. He'd gone through the wardrobe and was back at the Dursleys, and was sitting by the window with his hands behind his head, eyes closed, thinking about magic. He'd been there for what felt like minutes, but it was fully dark, now, and it hadn't been when he'd come through the wardrobe.

A soft hoot broke his reverie. Hedwig was there, sitting on a branch on a tree across the street. Harry waved her over, and felt a burst of affection for the owl – she'd known him well enough to not just swoop in, giving him time to think.

"Hey, girl," he said softly, through the still night air, and she flew over, alighting on the windowsill.

He untied the messages on her leg. Like Harry, Hedwig lived a dual life during the summer – days on the island, nights in England. Every few weeks Harry would send her around to his friends.

The letter from Cho was short – she was in Austria with her parents, who were at yet another Astronomy conference, and she was trying to finagle a ticket to one of the World Cup qualifiers that would be held there.

The letter from Cedric was also short, but it was far more intriguing.

Harry,

I was talking to Luna the other day – we had her over for dinner – and we got to talking about Hogwarts. She's starting this year, and she's very interested in the castle. Well, I happened to let slip that we've done a bit of exploring, and that we were having a little problem getting past a door. (Don't worry, I didn't say anything specific.)

I mentioned that we needed keys, and straightaway, she had it. That girl has a way of thinking that gets right to the heart of things, but takes a strange direction to get there. But anyway, she said something, and I'm pretty sure it's right. It's very Hufflepuff, anyway.

Long story short, I have a really, really good idea where we can look for the keys. I'll tell you when I see you on the train in a few weeks, because I want to see the look on your face.

Summer was fun. Ran through some Quidditch drills yesterday with Fred and George. (Well, they ran through some Bludger practice.) They had some interesting things to say about running into you in Diagon Alley. Anything you want to tell me?

- Cedric

Harry stared down at the parchment in frustration. "Really, you're going to wait two weeks and make me insanely curious? That's just mean." Hedwig hooted in agreement.

The third letter wasn't actually a letter – it was a photo. Small and compact, a little roll that unfurled without wrinkles or bends (magic, thought Harry once again, was awesome) into a hand-sized photograph. Fleur evidently favored a Muggle camera – the picture was static, but that didn't mean it wasn't interesting.

The two of them were captured mid-conversation, neither of them looking at the camera, both intent on the other. They were inclined towards each other, animated and energetic even though the picture was still.

What really struck Harry was the contrast. Fleur looked fifteen and radiant. Harry looked ten, at best – his clothes ill-fitting, his glasses too thick, the lenses making his eyes look cartoonishly distorted.

With a mounting, unsettling sense of horror, he shoved the picture away like it had burned him and moved resolutely to the bed.

Sleep was a long time in coming.

In the morning, when he looked at the photo again, and it hadn't changed, he moped. He delayed going back through the wardrobe. He shot off a sarcastic letter to Cedric, dug his broom out of his trunk and spent almost an hour cleaning it, and then dressed, giving his ratty jeans and t-shirt the evil eye.

Harry sighed. It didn't take a genius to figure out what was going on, but still, when he'd realized what this newfound fascination with his appearance signified, he'd brooded all morning, bemoaning the fact that he was a predictable, hormone-crazed teenager after all.

Well, I can fight it, or I can lean into it.

He marched through the wardrobe. He moved through the Flamels' house with dark purpose, his shoulders hunched, steps heavy, as if he were marching to his doom. Perenelle's room was on the east side of the house, with a large window dominating the outward-facing wall, the better to catch the sunrise. The ancient lady herself was hard at work, leaning over a drafting table that sat in the center of the room. She was sun-baked and her hands were flecked with ink and she looked barely a day over thirty.

Perenelle didn't even look up from the drafting table. Harry glanced at it – they looked like plans for an opera house, immensely complex and detailed. "Good morning, Harry. What can I do for you?" Perenelle Flamel's voice was a rich contralto, pleasantly deep and subtle.

Harry took a deep breath. He squared his shoulders. And then he did the bravest thing he'd ever done.

"I want you to dress me."



* * *



"Honestly, it wasn't what I was expecting at all."

Harry dodged to the side, letting the spell fly past him harmlessly.

"Come on, Harry. Less dancing around, more countering." Sirius blew a Reducto into the sand in front of Harry, forcing him to duck and shield his eyes. "See what I mean?"

"Yeah, yeah," said Harry. He got to his feet and wiped his face, and his hand came away gritty. He narrowed his eyes, and as Sirius moved his wand, Harry jumped all over it, viciously slashing the air in front of him. The red light of Sirius's Stunner died on the wand.

Sirius grunted in approval. He threw up a Shield Charm, catching his breath behind it. "So she took you to some fancy clothes shop in Athens. Then what?"

"Well, I was expecting it to be a nightmare. You know, hours and hours of trying on clothes, absurd outfits, salesladies making quippy comments about how many girls I'm going to attract with my new look, stuff like that." Harry fired a Stunner into Sirius's shield, and scowled a bit as it absorbed it neatly.

"I'm kind of surprised Perenelle took you in the first place," said Sirius. "She's a busy lady."

"Who else was I going to ask? No offense, but if you take a look at the adults on this island, it's not exactly a bastion of good taste. Snape, Remus, Dumbledore…"

Sirius dropped the shield and fired off a Slug-Vomiting Jinx. Harry flubbed the block and had to throw himself to the side to avoid it. "What about me, Harry? I have excellent fashion sense."

"Right," said Harry dryly, getting back up, his wand held loosely as he eyed Sirius. "Look me in the eye and tell me that you wouldn't have used that as an excuse to pull some hilarious prank where I'd step out of the dressing room and I'd suddenly be wearing a dress."

"Ah, you know me too well," said Sirius. "So, anyway, it wasn't that bad?"

"No, was fine. We got there, she looked me up and down like I was a cut of meat on a butcher's table, then zipped around the shop grabbing things. Took all of five minutes."

"And she didn't want you to buy ridiculously expensive designer clothes?" Sirius waved his wand, conjuring a pair of birds that swooped at Harry in random patterns.

"Nah. She said I'd grow out of anything she picked out in about six months, so what was the point?" Harry quick-fired from the hip, roasting them both with well-placed Conflagration Curses.

The fire was a little excessive, and Sirius stumbled back and out of the way. "A little warning next time. I think you singed my eyebrows."

Harry ignored him, and took a few steps back, pivoting to face Sirius with one foot forward, wand up. "And then, when I offered to pay, she just laughed me off. I mean, the whole 'transmuting metal into gold' thing makes money kind of trivial for her, and I learned from Cedric to accept gifts gracefully, but it still stung a little."

"So all in all, not a bad experience."

"Sure, but I'm kind of dreading what comes next." Harry whipped his wand forward and cast a quick Antler-Growing Hex, which Sirius easily blocked, then followed it up by transfiguring the sand between them into a glowing golden rope, then Banishing it at Sirius. Sirius dropped his easygoing expression as the rope flew towards him, eyes widening. The golden glow was cosmetic – but Sirius didn't know that.

A sharp Diffindo sliced the rope in two, and dual sections of it coiled limply to the ground on either side of Sirius. Harry was already in motion, waving his wand in a tight, complicated pattern as he transfigured the ropes into cobras. Transfigured snakes were quite happy to follow his orders, and a quick word of Parseltongue out of Harry's mouth had them rising, hissing, darting towards Sirius…

With a yelled incantation, Sirius went to one knee, jamming his wand in the sand. A purple pulse of light blinded Harry and rocked him back. He stumbled onto his knees, covering his eyes, and when he looked up, the snakes were gone and the sand around Sirius had turned to glass.

"Dick move, Harry," said Sirius, his grin back in full force. "So what happens next?"

Harry sighed. "I made a bet with Cho last year that I wouldn't start caring about clothes and stuff. Only five Galleons, but still."

"You'll live." Sirius rolled his eyes.

"She's going to laugh at me."

"So? It's funny. Laugh along with it. At least you'll look good doing it."

"That's a Sirius Black strategy if I ever heard one."

Sirius stuck his tongue out, then shot a silent Stupefy at Harry's head. Harry muttered a Protego and blocked it easily.

"Shield Charm's getting better," said Sirius approvingly as he studied the golden glow surrounding Harry. "Tighter, more even. Neat trick with the snakes, too. How did you transfigure them both so fast?"

"I did them both at the same time," said Harry. He grinned. He was trying for mysterious, but he wasn't sure how well he pulled it off. "Just because the rope was in two pieces doesn't mean it wasn't still one rope, at least from the rope's point of view."

Sirius groaned. "Please, Harry, tell me you're not going to start talking like Dumbledore."

"Of course not, my dear boy. Why, my voice will remain well and truly my own, for whose else could it be, in truth?"

Sirius narrowed his eyes. "All right, you're asking for it." He snapped his wand forward, waving it slightly, flicking his wrist at the end of the movement, and started shooting rapid-fire Hurling Hexes at Harry, over and over, bracketing the air with them, far too many for Harry to block or absorb.

Thankfully, Harry wasn't there when they arrived. Faster than he'd ever done so before, he slipped into the right frame of mind – and even after practicing for almost a month, it felt about as natural as running backward with his eyes closed – and cast a formless Arresto Momentum. Like a projector changing from one slide to the next, with no more transition than that, he was moving, one step taking him gliding over the sand, fifteen feet away from Sirius.

A second cast sent him in a tight arc, moving to flank Sirius, whose expression was stunned even as he swung his arm around to track Harry's erratic motion. Sirius shot more spells at him, but they missed wildly. Harry was too fast. It was a wild, breathless kind of movement, one step sending him bounding forward, then to the side, all without the distraction of inertia. He was almost flying. It was like having wires connected to his body, and tugging them just so, moving wherever he wanted. He was a leaf on the wind, and Sirius was a snail, he could do anything, he was in complete control –

And that was when he slammed into Sirius's conjured net. Harry flailed in midair, trying to throw it off, and only succeeded in tangling himself further. Wrapped up beyond hope of recovery, he toppled and fell heavily in the sand.

"What the hell was that?" said Sirius, jogging over to Harry's side. The older man used his wand to carefully slice open the net. "How were you moving so fast?"

"Kinda hard to explain, Sirius. One of those Dumbledore things. Taking a spell and doing something really weird with it," said Harry, panting with exertion as he threw off the rest of the material. He collapsed in a sprawl on the sand, chest heaving. "Wild ride, though."

"I'll say." Sirius pursed his lips. "I have to say, not really what I expected when you started learning directly from Dumbledore. He's so… still, and graceful. He barely moves when he's fighting. You looked like some kind of berserk flying squirrel." He bent and offered a hand.

"I doubt it would be useful during an actual fight. I mean, I can't cast anything else when I'm jumping around like that." Harry took Sirius's proffered hand and got to his feet.

"Neat party trick, though."

They were silent for a moment. The morning was slowly turning over into late morning, the sun topping the trees and casting the beach in brilliant white.

"Do we have time for another duel?" asked Harry.

Sirius checked his watch. "Nope. It's almost eleven here, so the Express leaves in about an hour, London time. Let's grab some lunch, I'll wash that down with a disgusting bit of Polyjuice, you finish packing, and I'll Apparate you to King's Cross."

"Sounds good." They both lapsed into silence again.

Sirius turned to him. "Just say the word, Harry, and I'll pack up and live as a dog in the Forbidden Forest."

"I'm not worried about the plan, Sirius. Well, not much. If everything goes off like we want, I won't even have to do anything."

"Sure," said Sirius, turning and looking back out at the ocean, looking far into the distance. "But when do they ever go like we want?"

An hour later, after a round of goodbyes and a hurried lunch, Harry found himself dragging his trunk through the wardrobe. He cursed as he maneuvered it through the narrow space, letting it drop to the ground on the other side. Sirius came through after him in the body of a grey-haired man in his fifties. Instead of taking Harry's hand immediately, Sirius concentrated on a seemingly random spot on the wall, near the baseboard, pulled out his wand, and muttered a spell.

"What was that?" asked Harry, taking the trunk up again as Sirius took his hand and prepared to Apparate.

"Random temperature variation charm," said Sirius smugly. "I always cast it on the taps in the shower whenever I come through."

"Real mature, Sirius."

Sirius's expression went dark for a second. "Oh, believe me, I could have done a lot worse."

He took Harry's hand, spun in place, and Harry felt the world compress and twist around him. King's Cross popped into view in an explosion of noise and color. Harry staggered, almost dropped the trunk. He'd never quite gotten used to Apparation. It was dead useful, sure, but it was a sensation that was deeply uncomfortable.

They were in a little out-of-the-way corner of the station, discreetly charmed so Muggles wouldn't pay much attention to it. Harry craned his neck over the crowd, and could just make out the barrier between Platforms Nine and Ten.

"Well, this is it." Sirius turned to him, a wry grin on his face. "Now, remember, summers are for hard work and learning. School is for what?"

"Fun."

"And?"

"Meeting girls."

"And…?"

"Pranking Slytherins."

"And?"

"Getting killed by Voldemort."

Sirius shook his head. "Harry…"

"Oh, right. Not getting killed by Voldemort. I always get that one mixed up."

They shared a small smile of understanding. Sirius clapped Harry's shoulder, gave him a nod, and Disapparated. Harry watched the space where his godfather had vanished for a second, then grabbed his trunk and made his way through the crowd.

Platform Nine and Three-Quarters was busy; Harry had cut it a bit close. He saw the entire Weasley family – there seemed to be several dozen of them – arranging their trunks and exchanging last-minute goodbyes. The youngest one, the girl, locked eyes with Harry for a second, her eyes went wide, and she ducked behind her mother. Percy was chatting with a rather bedraggled but kindly-looking man that Harry assumed was Mr. Weasley. Percy's prefect badge was prominently displayed on his robes.

"Harry!" And there was Cedric. The older boy caught Harry in a hug, grinning. He stepped back, his grin widening as he took in Harry's appearance. "Oh, man. Cho is going to – "

"I'm aware of that," said Harry resignedly. He brushed past it, though, fixing Cedric with an intent stare. "Your letter. Tell me. You know where we can get the keys?"

"I have a strong hunch," said Cedric. "And, I really should drag it out a bit, just to mess with you, but I guess you already waited two weeks."

"Damn straight."

Cedric drew closer, lowering his voice. "So, I asked Luna, hypothetically, where she'd look for keys. And she said, right away, like it was the most logical thing in the world, 'have you asked Hagrid?'"

Harry frowned. "Why would…" he trailed off. Hagrid. The caretaker of the grounds. He watched over the forest, did some maintenance, and a few other tasks. But, his actual title was something else. The Keeper of the Keys.

If there had been a desk handy, Harry would have planted his face in it. As it was, he just covered his face with his palm. "Of course. That is so… damn… Hufflepuff."

"Right?" said Cedric, shaking his head. "I'm not sure, of course, but…"

"No, no, that's got to be it. Almost definitely."

"One way to find out."

"Right away. Tomorrow morning. And then we need one more. I'm pretty sure about Daphne. And as for the fifth, I was thinking – "

"Harry!"

This time, he was hugged from behind without even the chance to turn around. But when she let him go, and when she saw him, he almost wished he hadn't.

Cho was just pointing at him, face lit up like it was Christmas. She made a noise like she was being strangled. Harry dug into his pocket and quickly pulled out a small bag, shoving it into her hands.

"Here. Five Galleons. I'll double it if you don't say anything."

Of course, at that moment, it was probably hard for her to form coherent words even if she wanted to. She was just looking at him, and every time she did, she laughed. Harry knew what she was seeing – Harry Potter, in slacks and a button-down, with a shiny pair of loafers, the dark brown complimenting the slacks perfectly. A pair of glasses, slimmed down to bare elegance, framing his eyes perfectly.

"You… you…" said Cho, her mirth making her words difficult.

"You can just shut right the hell up," said Harry, scowling darkly.

Cho laughed all the way to their compartment.



* * *



The Great Hall was subdued but antsy as the Sorting dragged on. Harry had to stop himself from fidgeting. They were nearing the end of the alphabet, but the last few kids had taken their sweet time, and the crowd was feeling it – the applause after each name was clipped.

"Come on, come on," muttered George, who was sitting to Harry's left. "I'm hungry."

"Almost there," said Fred. "Oh, look. Ginny's up next. Three guesses where she's headed, and the first two don't count."

"WEASLEY, GINEVRA," called the stern voice of Professor McGonagall.

The girl marched forward, looking at turns resolute and nervous. She stuffed the Hat on her head and plopped down on the stool.

"What kind of name is Ginevra?" said Harry out of the corner of his mouth, inclining his head towards George.

"I don't know," said George, shrugging. "What kind of name is Ginny?"

"GRYFFINDOR!" called the Hat. Fred and George clapped loudly, heckling their sister as she practically ran to the end of the Gryffindor table and sat beside the other first-years.

As the applause died down, Aberforth Dumbledore stood at the Head Table and cleared his throat. The noise in the Great Hall immediately died to a mere buzz. The other professors at the Head Table sat there attentively. Harry marked Doge carefully – the old man looked as bland and unassuming as always, but he was a very definite wild card, and this year especially, Harry did not want wild cards.

"First-years, welcome to Hogwarts," said the Headmaster in his characteristically gruff voice. "Everyone else, welcome back. I have a few announcements about classes and Quidditch tryouts, but I'll save them for after dinner."

Harry saw George breathe a sigh of relief.

"Except to say this," said Aberforth, raising a finger. "The east wing corridor on the third floor is strictly off-limits for the year. Security spells have been placed, and should you breach them, detention will be the very least of your worries. Now, to dinner." The Headmaster sat abruptly and clapped his hands, and dinner appeared. The noise in the Hall gradually ratcheted up as conversations started again.

Oliver Wood, sitting across from Harry, frowned. "That was a bit odd, wasn't it?"

"What, that he left the important Quidditch stuff until after dinner?" asked Harry.

Fred snorted, and Oliver was diverted in a discussion about Quidditch – just as Harry had intended. It was a careful game they were playing, Harry and the rest of his family. Good bait didn't do anything to draw attention to itself.

The food was as Harry had remembered – hearty, and lots of it. Conversations ebbed and flowed as plates were emptied and less attention went into eating.

Katie Bell, who was sitting a few places down from Oliver, caught Harry's eye as he reached for a bowl of mashed potatoes. "Are those new glasses, Harry? They look really good."

"They are, thanks."

For some reason, she blushed slightly, and her next words came very fast. "So, good summer?"

"It was interesting," said Harry. "I learned a whole new way to conceptualize magic."

"Oh," said Katie. "I got to visit my cousin in Iceland. But your thing sounds fun, too, I guess. What electives are you taking?"

Harry opened his mouth to answer, but as he did, there was a noise. A loud, dull clattering sound that came from the direction of the Entrance Hall. Harry glanced over and saw, very faintly, the great wooden doors to the Hall shake slightly, as if someone had thrown something against it.

Here and there around the Great Hall, conversations faltered as students exchanged glances.

"Did you hear that, Oliver?" said Fred, craning his neck to get a better view.

With a loud bang, the doors flew open. No one could miss that. Standing framed in the doorway was Argus Filch. The caretaker was holding up a lantern to his face as if guarding it from something. He was still, unmoving.

Slowly, ever so slowly, he toppled over. But not in the way a person would fall over. He fell over like a statue, and he didn't move at all as he hit the ground, face-first. The silence was punctuated by a few shocked gasps.

McGonagall stood at the Head Table. "Mr. Filch!" she said in a stern, raised voice. "What is the meaning of this?"

Harry felt something warm and wet on his hand.

He looked down. There was a drop of something red on the back of his thumb. Frowning, he raised it to his face and used his other hand to prod it. It smeared. It was blood, red and vibrant and even a little warm.

Katie shrieked.

His head snapped up to look at her. She was looking at the ceiling, her hand half-raised in an aborted pointing gesture. Harry followed her gaze. The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall showed a starless, cloudy night. But something else was there, too.

Written in the ceiling of the Great Hall in twenty-foot letters, red and scrawled in blood, were words.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED.

NONE OF YOU ARE SAFE.

And then there was screaming.

Author's Note:

A little experiment in crowdsourcing. So, I've changed the summary for this fic at least four or five times, and I'm still not happy with it. Yes, summaries are tricky in general, but this story has a few additional challenges:

1) I don't want to spoil the mystery of Harry's first year, so I can't come at it from the "Harry is raised by X" angle.

2) There's really no "hook" to What You Leave Behind - it's simply a reinterpretation of the entire series, Years 1-7, with a few big AU changes (aging Harry a year and the history of Grindelwald's rise and fall being the major ones.)

So, readers - my summary is only decent, not great. Can you top it? If you've got an idea - it doesn't have to be fully fleshed out, or perfect - stick in a review. (I say review and not PM because it's crowdsourcing, which means these ideas should be public, because even if yours doesn't work, someone might see it and take it in a different direction that ends up working.)

As an incentive, if your idea ends up being the "spine" of my (hopefully much better) new summary, I'll give you naming rights to an upcoming character (subject to my approval - I won't let you name a perfectly normal new Hogwarts student Lord Blackskull Burnface just because you can, for example.) As an added bonus, to help you name the character, I'll tell you some specific details about how/when they come into the story, which will end up giving you a bit of a sneak peek into the future of the fic. (If you'd rather not be semi-spoiled, I can make the details very ambiguous.)

Anyway, it would be really cool if this works - this is the first real "reader participation" gimmick I've tried, so... fingers crossed.

(Of course, if you don't have any particular thoughts about the summary, a normal review with thoughts, emotions, rants, suggestions, or whatever kind of response you have is still encouraged and appreciated.)

Chapter 10 – Webs

It was chaos.

Hundreds of voices rose at once, dozens of screams threaded through the noise, amplifying it, the fear and tension like a palpable thing – heavy, thick.

Harry was standing before he was even aware of it, staring at the ceiling, his hand dropping to his hip, palm slapping the faded leather of his father's holster, fingers tightening around the well-worn holly, mind blank.

The bloody letters on the ceiling of the Great Hall twisted and writhed – and dropped. They lost cohesion as they fell, blending into a deluge of red with the volume of a swimming pool. Harry's hand twitched, his wand sketching the outline of a Shield Charm, knowing even as he did that it would be too late, it wouldn't be enough –

A golden line shot across the Hall in the blink of an eye, twisting and expanding into a sheet, shimmering and solid. It covered the entire room like a second ceiling, darkening into translucence as the torrent of blood splashed against it. Harry's eye was drawn to the High Table, where Aberforth Dumbledore stood with his wand thrust into the air like a torch, his profile framed by the throne-like Headmaster's chair.

"SILENCE!" The Headmaster's voice was plenty loud without magical amplification. The crescendo of voices ebbed, and settled into a low, rumbling murmur.

Harry slowly slid back into his seat, ignoring the questioning looks from Fred and George, and the alarmingly inquisitive stare of Hermione.

Up at the front of the room, the staff was buzzing with activity. Aberforth stood like the masthead of a ship, his wand aloft, maintaining the shield, as he calmly issued directions. McGonagall stepped forward and murmured something, flicking her wand sharply at the ceiling. Blood started pouring over the side of the Headmaster's shield, flowing into McGonagall's wand like movie footage of a fire hose played in reverse. Another murmured aside from the Headmaster sent Snape and Flitwick down to the side door and the still, silent body of Filch.

"What… was that?" asked Fred, his usual mischievous expression replaced by a shocked one.

Harry looked across the room and caught Cedric's eye. Cedric looked back with a grim expression. He obviously hadn't missed the implications of the bloody message: that they weren't the only ones interested in the Founders' Rooms.

"That," said Harry, "was not part of the plan."

"Everyone will stay in their seats." Aberforth's voice cut through the murmurs once again. "The professors and I are going to investigate this incident. You may talk quietly amongst yourselves. Prefects, coordinate with the Head Boy and Girl. Keep things orderly." The Headmaster's eyes swept over the room as he lowered his wand, the golden shield dissipating as the last drops of blood flowed into McGonagall's wand. "Everything is under control."

The babble of voices started up again as Aberforth stepped down from the High Table and started a whispered conference with the rest of the staff. Snape and Flitwick – now levitating Filch's prone body – exited the Hall. The teachers broke into teams and started fanning out, leaving two by two, until only a beleaguered-looking Professor Sprout, a baffled-looking Sybill Trelawney, and a blank-faced Professor Doge and one of his Auror guards remained.

"So," said Fred, pitching his voice low as he turned to Harry and George. He needn't have bothered – absolutely everyone in the Great Hall was talking in furious whispers. "What d'you reckon?"

"Chamber of Secrets, huh?" said Fred. "We've never run across anything like that, have we?"

George nodded towards the Slytherin table, where a few of the older students were surrounded by a rapt audience. "Reckon they know something about it? Messages in blood would be right up their alley."

A few of the bolder students stood up and scurried from group to group, going to find friends in other Houses. The prefects tried to put a damper on it, but some of them seemed more interested in joining the growing conversations than with enforcing the rules. Strangely enough, Percy Weasley was in the latter group – he stood near the front of the room, nodding distractedly at the gaggle of prefects forming their own gossip circle, making no real attempt to snuff out the activity of the students.

Harry waited until there was enough mingling going on that he wouldn't stand out, then slipped away from the Gryffindor table and made his way to where Cedric was holding court at the end of the Hufflepuff table.

"We need to talk," muttered Harry, tapping Cedric's shoulder. "Meet me over by the Gryffindors." Without waiting for a reply, Harry moved to the Ravenclaw table.

The conversations in the Great Hall were getting louder, and Harry overheard snippets as he made his way through the increasingly mobile crowd.

" – see the way Filch looked, all stiff like that?"

" – wouldn't be surprised if the Ministry sent people to investigate – "

" – jog my memory, but I think I heard something about a Chamber of Secrets in a history book – "

" – all that blood. It was scary, I just looked up and it was there – "

Cho, as usual, was part of a gaggle of female Ravenclaws. As Harry approached, however, he noted that she wasn't the center of attention to the degree she usually was. She looked slightly irritated, and though Harry was loathe to analyze the social dynamics of third-year girls, it looked like she'd been subtly shuffled out of the way. She had her chin in her hands, slightly slumped over onto the table. Her eyes tracked Harry as he moved into her vision, and she nodded as Harry gave her a meaningful wave.

With as much discretion as he could muster, Harry ambled back to the Gryffindor table and took a position near the end. Most of the House was clustered on one side, where Hermione had pulled a textbook from her bookbag and appeared to be reading from it to an enraptured audience, which was the first time Harry had ever heard himself think that particular sentence.

After a few minutes, Cho and Cedric slid into the seats across from him. Harry eased his wand out of its holster and cast a muttered Muffliato under the table.

"You'll have to teach me that spell sometime," said Cedric. "It's been good to us."

"Maybe later for that," said Cho. She looked up at the ceiling, where the enchanted night sky twinkled merrily, as if hadn't just been the scene of something horrible. "This is bad, isn't it?"

"It is," said Harry. "It means someone else is after the Rooms, and the announcement didn't exactly scream 'friendly competition'."

"What happened to Filch?" asked Cedric. "Is he dead?" His voice was quite steady.

"I don't think so," said Harry. "Snape and Flitwick cast an awful lot of spells for that. Dead is dead. I think they just couldn't quite figure out what had happened to him. He looked frozen, or petrified. Maybe some kind of magical suspension. Whatever it was, if Snape and Flitwick couldn't reverse it right away, it was probably something pretty Dark."

Cho shuddered. "I don't like Filch, but nobody deserves that."

"We need to meet," said Harry. "We shouldn't talk in the open like this, but there are things I need to tell you both."

"And the keys?" asked Cedric. "Are we still going after them?"

"Yeah," said Harry. "And the sooner the better. This whole Chamber of Secrets thing makes things complicated. But yeah, I think your Hagrid brainwave was spot-on, and we should talk to him tomorrow."

Cho leaned forward. "If he has them, and we get them, then we still need two more people. And one of them has to be a Slytherin."

"Hermione and Daphne," said Harry. He looked between his two friends. "If either of you have a problem with either of them, now's the time to speak up."

"You just decided?" asked Cedric, arching an eyebrow.

"No, I'm just putting it out there," said Harry.

"In a way that makes it seem like you've already made a decision," said Cedric, leaning back and shrugging.

"I'm not," said Harry. "I'm just – look, do you have a problem with the two of them, or not?"

Cedric opened his mouth – then closed it and shook his head. "No, they're fine."

Harry stared at him doubtfully. "If you – "

"I said they're fine, Harry."

"I'm still not sure about Daphne," said Cho, "but she's the only Slytherin I'd even consider, so I suppose she'll do."

"Well, as long as you're both enthusiastic about it," said Harry, looking between his friends in consternation. He felt like he was missing something, but before he could press Cho and Cedric, they were interrupted by a commotion from the other end of the table.

While he'd been focused on his friends, a group of Slytherins had made their way over. The groups were arrayed in opposition, a dozen or so on each side. Harry picked out Hermione's voice right away.

"… have any facts at all. You're just trying to scare us."

"Oh, am I?" said Draco Malfoy. He was at the head of the Slytherins – mostly lower years, as well as the entire Slytherin Quidditch team. Harry also spotted Daphne and Tracey off to the side, clearly separate but still a part of the conversation. Tracey, in particular, was glaring daggers at Draco.

"Piss off, Malfoy," said Oliver Wood, backed up by an impressive array of Gryffindor scowls and crossed arms. "No one's buying the tripe you're peddling."

"It's common knowledge, if you know the right people," said Malfoy. He seemed to be almost glowing, his face gleeful and pinched at the attention. "The Chamber of Secrets is only a danger to… lesser wizards."

"The message said none of you are safe," said Hermione, glaring at him.

"Exactly," said Malfoy. "You. Salazar Slytherin saw that this school had started to accept all sorts of riffraff, and the monster's going to clear you people all out."

"What do you mean, you people?" said George, moving forward to get in Malfoy's face.

Malfoy's two henchmen – Harry couldn't remember their names – stepped forward, and Malfoy sneered from between them. "You know who I'm talking about, Weasley. You and your loser family might scoot by, but I hope not. Blood traitors are just as bad as mudbloods, if you ask me. Slytherin's likely to be the last House left, when it's all over."

There was a collective intake of breath, and Harry could practically feel a wave of curses – both literal and figurative – about to be sent Draco's way from the Gryffindor side. He took a step forward, wanting to forestall a potential firefight in the middle of the Great Hall during an emergency – but Tracey Davis beat him to the punch.

"Oh, sit down, Malfoy. You haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about." Tracey shouldered her way through the crowd and fixed Malfoy with a look of such scorn and contempt that Malfoy actually took a step back. "That's not what Slytherin's about at all, and you know it. A proper Slytherin doesn't give a shit about blood status, she gives a shit about advantage. We're realists, and you're making us look stupid."

Malfoy's face went very pale. "You dare – "

Tracey ran right over him. "Salazar wasn't some pureblood fanatic. He was worried about the fact that Muggles were tying suspected wizards to wooden stakes and setting them on fire. He saw that they hated magic and were cruel, vindictive, stupid sheep, and he said 'let's go ahead and stay away from that.' The monster isn't for Muggleborns, it's for enemies of magic."

The reaction to her words was mixed – both the Gryffindors and the Slytherins were giving her uncertain, almost nervous looks. Draco Malfoy simply turned his back on her and crossed his arms, evidently pretending that she didn't exist.

Daphne, standing at her friend's side, gave Tracey a commiserating look and tugged on her arm, trying to draw her away from the crowd.

"See?" said Lee Jordan, scoffing at Malfoy. "Even the other Slytherins know you're full of shit."

Malfoy plunged his hand into his robes, and for a wild moment Harry thought he was going for his wand. Instead, he came out with a small, cream-colored envelope. He took two steps forward and thrust it into Harry's hand, all the while favoring Harry with a disdainful, snooty expression.

"Here, Potter." The letter secure in Harry's hands, Malfoy stepped back and brushed off his robes. "My father told me to give this to you. Best get it over with and then remove myself from this den of idiots."

Harry felt the letter between his fingers. It was expensive, heavy paper, and his name was scrawled in an elegant twist of ink. Harry was very aware of the eyes of the crowd on him. "Why'd you hand-deliver whatever this is, Drake?" The blond's eyes narrowed at Harry's misnomer. "Could have just sent me an owl."

"That's an interesting story, Potter," said Malfoy. His eyes crinkled gleefully with a look Harry had seen all too often on Dudley when he was about to do something particularly vicious. "You see, my father wanted to make sure this actually made it into your hands. Had a bit of a problem with our house-elf, you see. Unreliable, filthy little creature. Obsessed with you, you'll be thrilled to know."

"Are you going somewhere with this, Malfoy?" Harry waved the letter in his hand. "You're picking a pretty odd time to play delivery owl."

"I just want it over and done with," said Malfoy, sniffing. "I told father you were a lost cause, but he was adamant for some reason. Read it or don't read it, I don't really care."

Harry, aware of the speculative looks directed at the formal-looking letter from Lucius Malfoy in his hands, tucked the thing in his pocket and tried for breezy. "Whatever, Malfoy. I swear, if this is some offer to sell official Boy-Who-Lived bobblehead dolls or something, I'm going to be really disappointed. And I'd love to meet your house-elf sometime. He sounds loads more fun than you."

Malfoy's eyes glittered with malice. "A pity we had to get rid of him, then. Permanently."

An uneasy murmur made its way through the crowd, and more than a few Slytherins were looking askance at Malfoy. Harry opened his mouth to ask Malfoy what he meant…

"What's the meaning of this? What are you all doing?" Percy Weasley barged into the middle of the crowd throwing around glares like they were going out of style. "The Headmaster clearly told everyone to stay seated. Back to your House tables, all of you, before I start taking points off."

Over the sound of the crowd dispersing, Harry clearly heard Hermione turn to Ron Weasley and ask, "What's a house-elf?"

"I have to say, this wasn't what I was expecting."

Daphne glanced around, inching her chair back and looking irritated as it bumped against the wall. Her eyes wandered over the shelves and the lab table before settling on Cedric. "It's an interesting use of an expanded trunk, and I'm curious what we're doing here, of course, but it's a little… cramped."

The interior of Cedric's trunk – usually home to Cedric's potions equipment and a shelf of ingredients and textbooks – was currently playing host to five people. Harry was slouched against the desk, Cedric was sitting next to him, Cho was using the ladder that led to the trunk's ceiling as an impromptu chair, and Hermione was standing in pensive silence in the middle of the small room. It was, as Daphne had said, cramped.

"I'd like to know what we're doing here as well," said Hermione, half-raising her hand. "Harry, your message was a bit cryptic."

"It was," said Harry, crossing his arms, accidentally bumping against Cedric, who made an annoyed noise. "And I'm sorry about that, but it couldn't be helped. There are a few things going on, and a bunch of things I want to keep just between the five of us, and this is the safest place I could think of to talk."

"Well," said Daphne, "if nothing else, you've piqued my curiosity."

Hermione leaned forward. "Is it about the Chamber of Secrets? Or… or that letter Malfoy gave you? It's obvious you've got a secret, just by watching the way you acted last year…" she held up her hands, as if warding off something. "Not that I was, er, watching you or anything."

"I'm sure," said Cho, raising her eyebrow at Hermione.

"It does have something to do with that, yes," said Harry, shooting Cho a look, then turning to Hermione. "But to explain it, I kind of need to start at the beginning. And before we even do that, I need to make sure nothing we say leaves this room."

"Trunk," said Cedric absently.

"Right, trunk," said Harry. He reached into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out a rolled parchment, smoothing it out on his knees. "Before I tell you all what this is about, I need everyone to sign their names here."

Daphne craned her neck forward. "It's blank."

"It's just a normal piece of paper," said Harry. "But there's magic in the agreement itself. Which I'll have someone far more skilled than I tap into later and make it a binding promise, sort of. It won't curse you or anything, it'll just make the knowledge of the things we talk about kind of… slippery? It's a complicated spell."

"That sounds... a bit dodgy," said Hermione. Her forehead creased. "That kind of spell would have to be an offshoot of mind magic, combined with some kind of diffuse Charm, like the ones they don't even teach at Hogwarts. Who could you possibly know who could cast a spell like that?"

"Why don't you sign your name and find out?" said Harry, throwing her a cheeky smile.

Daphne turned to Cho and Cedric. "You two are okay with this?"

"We already know most of it," said Cedric. "And yeah, I guess." He shrugged.

"I don't know, Harry," said Hermione, casting apprehensive looks between Harry and the parchment on his knees.

"Look," said Harry, "it's not committing to anything. This is important stuff, and it has to do with what happened at the feast - you know, with the ceiling and the blood and Filch - and how I think the five of us can actually make a difference, but all you're saying by signing is that you won't tell anyone about it."

"Even Tracey?" asked Daphne.

"Sorry," said Harry. "It's important."

"Hmm." Daphne fixed Harry with an unblinking, considering look.

"I don't think I've ever seen you look so serious, Daphne," said Cedric, tilting his head and looking at the black-haired girl like he was seeing something new and possibly strange.

"There's more to Daphne than how she acts in public," said Harry, earning himself a pointed look from the girl in question.

"I'll sign," said Hermione abruptly. She looked around, as if daring someone to challenge her pronouncement. "I want to know." She snatched the parchment from Harry, drew a quill from her robes so fast Harry wondered if she hadn't used magic, and scrawled her name in surprisingly precise handwriting considering the uneven surface of her knee.

"Cedric and I are in, of course," said Cho.

Daphne nodded slowly.

They passed around the parchment and everyone signed it. No words were exchanged – it was somehow unstated but known that it was a moment, something heavy and real. The scratching of the quill was very loud in the enclosed space of Cedric's trunk.

"That's that, then," said Harry, looking up after signing his own name. He rolled the parchment carefully and set it on Cedric's desk. He squared his shoulders. "Okay. The easiest way to do this, I guess, is to start at the beginning and fill in the blanks. Hermione, what do you know about the Headmaster?"

Hermione drummed her fingers on her legs for a moment, as if marshaling her thoughts. "Aberforth Dumbledore is most famous for defeating Grindelwald alongside his brother, Albus. He was the Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts for nearly forty years, and then became Headmaster after his brother was exiled from Britain."

"And Albus?" asked Harry.

"The Headmaster's brother," said Hermione, words coming faster, facts spilling from her mouth. "He was instrumental in Grindelwald's rise – they were partners, and it was Albus Dumbledore's rhetoric of wizard dominance that swayed many people onto their side. He's supposed to be a very powerful wizard, and it was only when Aberforth convinced Albus of the error of his ways that Grindelwald was defeated, and that duel is one of the most famous in history."

"And after Grindelwald?"

Hermione slowed, her face scrunching a tad as she thought. "He taught at Hogwarts, too. He was the Headmaster, for a while. And then, during the war against You-Know-Who, he started a vigilante group. He was the Chief Warlock, and involved in the ICW, but he kept butting heads with the Ministry, according to Modern Magical History. He went behind their backs and started his own private vigilante group, and some of the worst death tolls of the war happened when that group interrupted battles between Aurors and Death Eaters. After You-Know-Who was defeated…" Hermione blinked, looking at Harry owlishly. "This has something to do with that, doesn't it? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and what happened when he tried to kill you?"

"Good guess," said Harry. "Keep going, though. Put the official version on the table, and then I'll fill in the gaps."

Hermione took a deep breath. "Albus Dumbledore lost his position of Headmaster and Chief Warlock after evidence came out that his group, The Order of the Phoenix, engaged in dangerous, ethically questionable actions during the war. He had a very public falling out with his brother, who condemned him during a trial in absentia at the Wizengamot. The trial ended with Albus being exiled from Britain, and the public outcry was so great that the Ministry enacted a spell, using the blueprint of the Trace, over the entire country. If Albus Dumbledore sets foot in England, the Ministry will be instantly alerted."

Hermione's recitation ended, and Harry looked around the room. Cho and Cedric looked a touch bored – they'd heard this part of the story, after all – and Daphne focused and neutral.

"That was pretty comprehensive, Hermione, thank you," said Harry. He leaned forward and scrubbed a hand through his hair. "Okay. What you need to understand – the first thing, I mean – is that everything you just said is true, pretty much, but it's true through the lens of the Ministry. That book you talked about – Modern Magical History – that's not objective fact. The Ministry leans on the newspapers and the publishers in magical Britain."

"You're starting to sound like Luna Lovegood," said Cedric, rolling his eyes. He turned to Hermione. "They do, though. My dad works at the Ministry. It's not exactly a secret."

"Thank you, mister helper," said Harry. Cedric shot him an annoyed look, and Harry held his hands up. "No, sorry that was uncalled for. I'm just stressed, is all. I really hope you guys can help me untangle this mess, because I can't."

"Go on, Harry," said Daphne.

"Albus Dumbledore did all those things. He helped Grindelwald gain power, and he went outside the law to fight Voldemort – oh, get a grip," he muttered as everyone else winced. "But you have to understand, he's a great wizard. Voldemort would have absolutely won without Dumbledore and the Order. They weren't perfect, but they were countering the Death Eaters the way a big organization like the Ministry just wasn't equipped to. He had charisma, too. When he talked, people listened. Combine that with his raw magical power – he was the only one who could stand toe-to-toe with Voldemort – and you can see why the Ministry feared him."

"How do you know all this?" asked Hermione

"Because I was raised by him," said Harry. "Dumbledore, and Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel, and my godfather Sirius Black and his best friend Remus Lupin."

That was met with a resounding silence, and then Daphne and Hermione jumped in at the same time.

"Sirius Black, the mass-murderer?"

"Nicolas Flamel, the alchemist?"

"No, and yes," said Harry. "Sirius was framed – I can tell you the details later, but the short version is that Peter Pettigrew betrayed my parents and framed Sirius. Sirius escaped Azkaban, went to Dumbledore, and planned how they were going to keep me safe, because they knew Voldemort wasn't dead."

Hermione's eyes were wide, and she leaned back. "That's… a lot to take in."

"I know," said Harry, "and I can tell you don't quite believe me. Voldemort was defeated when he tried to kill me, but he didn't die – he's still out there, a shadow of himself, looking for a way to return to his body. Just take my word for it for now, and know that I can prove it in the future, if you let me."

"I suppose that'll have to do," said Hermione.

"Right," said Harry. "Now, here's where it gets complicated – did either of you know that Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore have a sister?"

Hermione and Daphne looked at each other, then shook their heads.

"It's not widely known. Ariana is… ill. She had an accident as a child, and she's never been, er, quite all there in the head. Together, Albus and Aberforth could stabilize her, give her a normal life, but it took a prodigious amount of time and effort, and it was a day-to-day job. Which they did, gladly, because they love her. And then Albus got busy – Headmaster, Chief Warlock, the ICW… and Voldemort."

"He stopped taking care of her," murmured Hermione.

"He did," said Harry. "She got worse. Aberforth wasn't happy, which is the source of the widely-publicized bad blood between them. It isn't the case now, by the way. They don't agree on everything, but they're on the same side." Harry blew out a breath. "Now, here's the wrinkle – Ariana Dumbledore, today, is Ariana Doge."

"As in…?" asked Daphne.

"As in, she's married to our Defense professor, who's a longtime friend of the Dumbledores. This is where it gets tricky. Doge fought with Albus and Aberforth and Sirius and Lupin and my parents in the Order against Voldemort. He had a falling out with Albus after Ariana regressed – she's in St. Mungo's now, permanently – and they haven't spoken in years." Harry reached under his chair and rummaged around his book bag for a moment before drawing out a small journal. "My first year, Doge passed me this."

Hermione eyed it speculatively. "What is it?"

"My mum's journal," said Harry, cradling it lightly, almost protectively. "Doge was an Unspeakable, and he says mum was considering joining, and they were friends, and that's why he had it – but the journal itself doesn't say anything about that. What it does talk about, however, are the Founders' Rooms. My mum was obsessed with them. Each one of the four Founders had a secret room in the castle, a place of protection and knowledge and secrets and power."

"The Chamber of Secrets," said Daphne, putting the pieces together, her eyes alight with curiosity.

"Exactly," said Harry. "That was Slytherin's. There are three more."

"Why are they important?" asked Hermione. "I mean, of course they'd be fascinating from a historical standpoint, but…"

"Doge said there was something he could use to heal Ariana in Hufflepuff's room," said Harry. He opened the journal to a well-marked page, running his finger down the scrawl of his mother's writing. "There's supposed to be some kind of monster in Slytherin's room, kind of a guardian of Hogwarts. Ravenclaw's room 'bends to one's desires and creates reality from fantasy,' which sounds, you know, nice. Gryffindor's room 'shines a flame onto the deepest secrets.' And lastly" – he snapped the book shut – "all four together are apparently the foundation of Hogwarts's thousand-year old, insanely complex, near-impregnable array of protective enchantments."

Cedric shifted from his perch on the desk. "And now we know someone else is going after them. Someone powerful enough to twiddle with the enchantment on the ceiling of the Great Hall."

"It's worse than that," admitted Harry, looking down for a second. "I, ah, forgot to mention another thing. You see, this is one of those things that sounds worse than it actually is, but I kinda came up with a plan to start a rumor that the Flamels had to hide the Philosopher's Stone here at Hogwarts in order to lure a Death Eater to school."

"Harry…" said Cho, her tone at once worried and exasperated.

"No, no, there's a good reason, I promise!" said Harry, looking around a trunk full of dubious faces. "See, we know that Voldemort's back. Snape's Dark Mark – uh, Snape used to be a Death Eater, by the way – has been gradually getting clearer, and we think he's got some sort of toehold on life, like a golem or a homunculus, and the Stone would be the perfect way to bring him all the way back. So instead of waiting for whatever diabolical plan he comes up with, we're going to make him plan around this, and then hopefully trap Peter Pettigrew or whomever Voldemort sends to Hogwarts to get the Stone."

Cedric rubbed his forehead. "So the message about the Chamber of Secrets…"

"May or may not have anything to do with my plan," finished Harry. He spread his arms in what little personal space he had around him. "You can see why I wanted to get all this on the table."

"Why us?" said Hermione suddenly. She'd drawn into herself, absorbing Harry's words, but now she leaned forward and fixed him with a stare. "Cho and Cedric I get. They're your friends. You don't know Daphne and me as well."

"I'd like to," said Harry quietly. He shifted in his seat and steamrolled right over the slight moment of awkward silence his comment had engendered. "The main reason, though, is that we need five people, one from every House plus an extra. Last year, the three of us found the Hufflepuff room. The Gallery of Refuge. Well, the antechamber, I guess. We can't get in without four keys and four people to use them, and a fifth to open the door."

"It takes teamwork and inter-House cooperation," said Hermione.

"And you're here, too, because you get it, just like that." said Harry.

"And why am I here, Harry?" Daphne was cool and inscrutable, a far cry from the bubbly persona she usually had. From the look Cho was giving her, Harry wasn't the only one who'd picked up on the difference.

"You're here because you're the only Slytherin I even remotely trust," said Harry, matching her look for look. "Plus, with the whole I.H.C.C. thing, you've proven you want to reach out, that you want to make a difference and make things better. That means something."

Daphne arched an eyebrow. "Unless starting the club was part of my cunning Slytherin scheme."

"Oh, please," said Harry. "If any of the Slytherins actually have cunning plans beyond cheating at Quidditch or selling knock-off Wit Potions before exams, I'll eat…" he glanced around "…Cedric's shoes."

"Please don't," said Cedric.

"Anyway," said Harry, "that's the basic idea. Things are happening this year, possibly beyond my ability to control by myself. I want the five of us, generally, to help each other figure things out, and specifically to get into the Gallery."

"It's… quite a lot to think about," said Hermione.

"I know," said Harry. "It's probably too much. This whole thing with Voldemort, it hardly seems real to me sometimes, but I know it is. I know he's out there, and I have to be ready. But I can't – I don't want to… I mean, I'm not dragging anyone else into this if they're not sure."

"Harry…" said Hermione, and just as exasperated and worried as Cho had said the same single word a few minutes ago, Hermione sounded almost grateful – gentle, accepting, reaching out. "Of course I'll help you. I couldn't not. I read about You-Know-Who, about what he did. It isn't even a question." She looked down for a moment. "And… and it would be nice to have, well, not friends, but… someone to talk to, I suppose. Besides Neville and Padma, I mean. Not that I don't…" she shook her head ruefully. "Yes, I'm in."

Harry smiled at her, and it was warm and genuine. "I appreciate it. I mean, if you're okay putting your vendetta with Draco on the back burner…"

Hermione's face turned to stone. "That absolute…" she struggled for words. "I'll never let it go. Not ever. House-elves… living things, treated like that, thrown away." She glanced over at Cedric. "I don't suppose he could have been lying? Just trying to shock people and be seen as cruel?"

"It's a possibility," said Cedric. He hesitated. "But it's probably true. A lot of the old families have house-elves, and they're not exactly… it's kind of a two-way thing. Pride in excellent service, and a family that demands excellent service, they kind of feed off each other."

"So a house-elf would really just off himself if his family told him to?" asked Harry. "That's barmy." He shook his head. "Utterly barmy."

"It depends on the elf," said Cedric, shrugging. "Not all elves have the same personality, and not all families are that draconian. The Malfoys, though… I could see it."

"I hate him," said Hermione, almost visibly shaking, "I think I actually hate him. I know people can be cruel, but this is so far beyond that…" She looked away.

Daphne hadn't said a word throughout the entire exchange. Harry turned to her. "So, are you in?"

"I'm in," said Daphne. "You weren't wrong about me."

"Just like that?" asked Harry.

"Just like that." She nodded almost to herself. "Because you trusted us enough to tell someone, not just because you had to, but because you chose us. You know what secrets cost."

Harry looked at Daphne, and she looked at him, and a current of something, some emotion, some understanding, ran between them. Harry couldn't put a name to it, and the closest he could come was like recognizing like. He could see himself answering like that if he'd been her, if he'd been in that chair. Harry shook his head, clearing out the fleeting, confusing thought. He looked around the trunk at the four of them. Together, now, in some loose conspiracy.

"Well," said Cho brightly, clapping her hands together, "where do we start?"

"The keys," said Cedric. "I had – well, Luna had, I suppose – the idea that Hagrid would know where they'd be. Keeper of the Keys, and all."

"That's… obvious," said Daphne.

"It's really not, though," said Cho. "Hagrid's sweet, but he's the last person you'd think to ask about a centuries-old mystery that doesn't involve bloodsucking wereseals or something like that."

"Getting to Hagrid might be a problem," said Harry, leaning forward to rest his hands on his knees. "The Headmaster said they were bringing in Aurors to investigate what happened at the feast, and we need to avoid coming under too much scrutiny by them." He sighed at Hermione's inquisitive look. "I can explain that part later."

"Definitely later," said Cedric, covering a yawn. "I know we have tomorrow off, but I'm beat. Quidditch practice."

"Already?" asked Harry.

Cedric hummed an affirmative. "We should meet tomorrow and hash things out. I know there's a lot to figure out, long-term, but it shouldn't be too hard for us to just go down to Hagrid's after dinner. The three of us have been before. Nothing suspicious about that."

"Fine," said Harry. "Tomorrow." Everyone looked around, and Harry stood, an uncertain grin worming its way onto his face. "Meeting adjourned, then."

Daphne was first up the ladder, giving a curt nod to Harry before wordlessly ascending.

Hermione paused at the first step, turning to Harry. "It's really true? You-Know-Who is really back?"

"He never really left," said Harry.

She pursed her lips. "And the reason we're not shouting that fact from the rooftops?"

"It's related to why I have to be careful around the Aurors," said Harry. "Essentially, whatever Albus Dumbledore is for, the Ministry is against. I could say Voldemort's back, and maybe some people would listen to me, but no one important at the Ministry would without proof, and any proof I have is tied to Dumbledore."

"So it's just us," said Hermione.

Harry shrugged. "For now. And we've got people in our corner."

Hermione put a hand on the ladder, and then paused again. "What did the letter Draco gave you say?"

"Oh, that." Harry pulled out the envelope – still sealed but now slightly rumpled – from his jeans. "To be honest, I haven't opened it."

Cho looked at him appraisingly. "And you're not going to, right?"

Harry blinked. "You just knew that?"

"We know you pretty well, Harry," said Cedric. "Whatever's in the letter, Malfoy's dad is either trying to help you, or trying to hurt you. And you don't want Lucius Malfoy's help. So…"

"Right," said Harry slowly, drawing his wand from its holster. The faded leather was a comfortable, familiar presence at his side now. He held the tip of his wand to the letter and muttered, "Incendio." The letter burst into flame, and he held it away from his body as he looked at his friends. "Surely I'm not that transparent?"

"Surely you don't think you're the only one who can have a clever thought?" asked Cedric, crossing his arms.

Again, Harry felt a twinge of unease, something missing or eluding him. It was nothing more and nothing less than the thought that Cedric was acting weird.

"That's not what I meant," started Harry, but Cedric had already eased by Hermione and started climbing up the ladder.

Cho gave him a commiserating look, nudging his shoulder with hers, before following after Cedric.

That just left Hermione and an awkward silence.

"I should go too," said Hermione. "I've got some reading to do."

"We don't even have homework yet, Hermione," said Harry.

"Of course not. Thank goodness, too. That will give me time in the next few days to read everything about everything you just said."

Harry grinned. "Of course." He gestured at the ladder, and she went up. Harry followed after her.

The kitchens were warm and smelled like baking bread. Cedric's trunk was tucked away in a corner, inconspicuous alongside cartons of empty milk bottles. The house-elves scrubbing copper pots nearest their corner of the room gave Harry a cheerful, but respectful wave. Daphne was nowhere to be seen, and Cedric and Cho were just moving out of view up the stairs to the second floor.

Tracking them with his eyes, Harry muttered, "see you later, make sure the elves get Cedric's trunk back to his room," to Hermione, then hurried after his friends. He had an idea. It was a bad one, and he knew it was bad, but he knew he was going to do it anyway.

At the top of the stairs, near the fruit still-life portrait, Harry peeked out into the hallway and saw Cedric and Cho walking away, their backs to him. Ducking back into the stairway, Harry whipped his Invisibility Cloak from the small, magically expanded pocket in his robes where he also kept his mother's journal.

Harry threw the Cloak over himself and followed his friends.

Even as he hurried after them, he pre-condemned himself. It was stupid. It was wrong. It would probably backfire. But having thought of it, he couldn't not do it.

He shadowed Cedric and Cho as they made their way through the second floor hallways, saying little. After a few minutes they passed the hospital wing. The door was open, and Cedric slowed, sticking his head in. Harry, following behind, moved in closer to see what he was looking at. Cho gasped softly, moving past Cedric to stare.

Argus Flich lay supine on a bed, white sheets crisp and undisturbed underneath him. His face was frozen in an ugly rictus of anger and fear, one hand held up to his face as if warding off something.

Mrs. Norris was curled at his feet, her tail tucked under her body, eyes closed; her grey, matted fur rising and falling slowly, in and out, a sharp counterpoint to Filch's frozen visage. Cho made a noise in the back of her throat, like the beginning of a sob.

"They say he'll be okay when we get the right potion," said Cedric. He wasn't looking at Filch; rather, he was looking at Cho with an expression of such softness that Harry felt a squirm of embarrassment for intruding.

"I know," said Cho. She kept her voice down. The hospital wing had a way of doing that to people. "It's sad, though. Even Filch doesn't deserve this. And his poor cat…"

"They'll be back to their grumpy old selves soon enough," said Cedric. He grimaced. "And I expect we'll have more important things to worry about before too long."

That broke Cho out of her reverie. She turned to Cedric and looked at him steadily. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing."

"Cedric…"

He moved away from the hospital wing, walking a few steps down the hall. "Nothing."

Cho followed. "It's Harry, isn't it?"

Cedric stopped, half-turned, put his forehead up against the stone wall of the hallway. "Yes. No. Sort of." Cho just stood there, waiting. Eventually, Cedric sighed. "I don't like what it says about me that it bothers me."

"I met your dad, Cedric. Your mum, too." Cho put a tentative hand on his shoulder. "I know they think you're supposed to be the guy. The one everyone follows. The star."

"I'm going to be Quidditch Captain next year," said Cedric, still not looking at her. "It's in the bag. Heidi took me aside before the feast and let me know."

"That's great, isn't it?"

"Yeah." Cedric finally turned to Cho, his expression miserable. "But what am I supposed to do, throw a party for myself? Harry comes in with these big, actual problems, like, life and death. He's talking about plots and secrets and adventures, and I wanted all of that - I just didn't know I'd be the sidekick."

"You're not." Cho's expression turned resolute and she pinned him to the wall with her gaze. "You'll never be. Do you want to know how other people see you? How I see you?" She closed her mouth abruptly.

Cedric sighed. "I know, you're right. It's just… you know, how many kids fantasize about being a Quidditch captain at Hogwarts? I mean literal fantasies. I did that. With a toy broomstick that barely got above the ground. That's all I wanted. It's this huge, important thing and I just know it'll get shuffled off to the side and lost in everything else, and what really matters, what people will really say about me was how I stood next to Harry when it counted."

"That's what friends do," said Cho quietly.

"Yeah," said Cedric. He turned away, and then back, and then put a slightly awkward hand on Cho's shoulder. "Yeah." This time he said it with some conviction. "You're right. Er, thanks."

"Anytime," she murmured, and they walked down the hall, perhaps closer together than they had been.

As they moved out of sight, Harry slipped off the Cloak and stood there, staring at the place they'd been. He stood there for a long time.



* * *



Breakfast in the Great Hall was subdued the next morning. It was Sunday, and classes would start tomorrow, and students trickled in at odd intervals, bleary-eyed and hungry. As they ate, Harry noticed that a few times a minute, someone would look up at the ceiling quickly, almost surreptitiously, as if afraid of what they'd find there.

They were sitting at the Ravenclaw table. Harry sat next to Cho, who was avidly reading the latest issue of Which Broomstick?. Daphne, looking bright and cheerful, had dragged a beleaguered-looking Tracey over to sit with them, and the latter was currently stabbing at a plate of scrambled eggs with one hand, her entire demeanor suggesting a longstanding blood feud with mornings. Either that, thought Harry darkly, or Malfoy was giving her hell for challenging him so publicly.

Across from Harry, Cedric sat next to Hermione. He looked cheerful enough, and if there was tension or ambivalence still rolling around Cedric's mind, Harry couldn't detect it. He was animated and friendly, going over the finer points of Proto-Germanic rune derivations with Hermione.

Harry hid a smile behind a sip of tea. They're weren't friends, but they were friendly. It was a start.

"Are we still going to visit Hagrid later today?" asked Cho. She caught Harry's eyes over the top of the magazine, and though her tone was casual, her expression was anything but.

"After dinner, I think," said Harry. "Hagrid's usually out working during the day."

Cho made to reply, but looked up at the sound of dozens of owls swooping into the Great Hall. Harry spotted Hedwig immediately; she broke off from the flock and glided down to the end of the Ravenclaw table, great white wings back-beating as she alighted on the table in front of Harry.

Without pause, she dipped her beak into Harry's plate and started gobbling down sausages. "Help yourself," said Harry dryly.

"You've such a beautiful owl," said Hermione, sighing as she watched Hedwig eat. "I wish my parents would let me get a pet."

Harry unfastened the letter tied to Hedwig's leg. "Have a good trip to France?" he asked, and Hedwig barked something noncommittal without even raising her head from Harry's meal.

"So that's from your French pen pal?" asked Daphne, leaning forward, chin resting on her hands.

"How did you hear about her?" asked Harry, unrolling the letter.

"People talk," she said.

"Well, that's just peachy," muttered Harry. His eyes dropped to the letter.

Harry –

You will be happy to know that Gabrielle was quite enthusiastic about my stories of England, and that you yourself had much to do with that. My time with Ollivander was fascinating and educational, but a bit dry for her. She was, however, quite taken with stories of the irrepressible charm of the famous Boy-Who-Lived.

It's possible that I may have embellished a bit.

Beauxbatons is beginning to feel small to me. I wonder if you have felt what I've felt, in this. My thoughts and goals are beginning to eclipse this place.

One thing I love about school, though, is that I may fly, and not just fly, but compete. Speed is thrilling, but winning is satisfying. You must visit me, or I you – a good challenge is irreplaceable, no?

I hope you are well, Harry. I think of you often. There is more to you than meets the eye, and one day, I look forward to unraveling the mystery.

I've enclosed a recent photo. You were right, by the way. My former relationship is a faded memory, and I have already cast it aside as a trifle. We will see where this new one goes. If nothing else, it will not be boring.

- Fleur

Harry's eyes tracked to the end of the letter, and a smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. There was a polaroid attached to the bottom with Spello-tape. Harry pried it off the letter, eyes widening slightly.

"What is it?" asked Cedric.

"Er, just a picture of Fleur. Apparently she started dating someone." Harry squinted at the bottom of the photo, where the words Fleur & Dominique were scrawled. "Dominique, it says."

"Never liked that name for a guy," said Cedric. "Too…" he waved his hand, "…I don't know, pretty."

"You're in luck, then," said Harry, trying to keep a straight face as he slid the photo across the table to Cedric.

Daphne scooted over to look at it, and Hermione leaned over Cedric's shoulder. Cedric froze. His face turned steadily redder.

Harry knew exactly what he was seeing. The grounds of Beauxbatons, looking regal and immaculate in fall colors. In the foreground, standing in front of a fountain, were Fleur and another girl, practically draped in each other's arms. The other girl was a brunette, shorter than Fleur, with a mischievous smile, big, sea-green eyes, and a lush figure.

"Oh my," said Hermione, her face looking like it couldn't quite decide what expression to project.

Daphne cocked her head, peering at it appraisingly. "She's quite pretty, isn't she?"

"Which one?" asked Cho.

"Take your pick," said Daphne.

Cedric stood abruptly. He cleared his throat and tore his gaze away from the photo.

"I'll be in my trunk."

And with that, he walked away.



* * *



The sun was down, and in the fading light Harry could only barely make out the line of smoke rising from Hagrid's hut. The five of them – Harry, Cedric, Cho, Daphne, and Hermione, made their way across the grounds of Hogwarts, saying little.

The mood was tense. The Headmaster had announced at dinner that the investigation into the attack on Flich was ongoing, and would be carried out by Aurors from the Ministry. Aberforth's vagueness, combined with hard-faced Aurors roaming the corridors, had everyone on edge.

"We need to make this quick," said Hermione quietly. "Curfew is in an hour."

Cedric glanced back at the castle. "Shouldn't take long. He either has the keys or he doesn't."

"I still can't quite believe it'll be that easy," said Harry.

"Who knows, maybe there'll be another door behind that door, and to get the keys for that one, you have to arm-wrestle an Inferius or something," said Cho.

"Ha ha," said Harry, as they came to a halt. He stepped forward and knocked on Hagrid's door. The acrid but not altogether unpleasant smell of cooking, earth, and animals practically radiated from the interior.

"Who's there?" came a loud, gruff voice.

"It's Harry and Cedric and Cho," said Harry, "and a few more."

The door swung open, the vast figure of Hagrid framing it. "Oh, it's you lot. What're yeh all doin' out so late?"

A huge canine head poked its way through the door past Hagrid, tongue lolling as it panted happily. Hagrid pushed him back with an easy shove and a muttered, "get back, Fang."

"We just wanted to talk for a bit," said Harry. "Well, that's not quite true – we actually had a question for you."

Hagrid frowned. "One question won' hurt, I suppose." He shuffled back from the door, waving them in. "Who're these, now?" he said after they'd come inside, gesturing at Hermione and Daphne.

"Hermione Granger and Daphne Greengrass," said Harry.

"Pleasure to meet yeh," said Hagrid. "Yer both good in my book if yer a friend o' Harry's."

Cedric stepped forward, craning his neck slightly to look up at Hagrid. "Hagrid, look, like Harry said, we've got a question for you. Do you have the keys?"

Hagrid blinked. "Keys? Have quite a few keys, don't I?" He dug his beefy hand into his pocket and came out with a key ring easily the size of a dinner plate, the iron circle bulging with what had to be at least a hundred keys of all shapes and sizes.

"No, the keys," said Cedric. He looked at Hagrid meaningfully.

"Er…" Hagrid looked puzzled, looking back and forth between the key ring and Cedric.

Cho nudged Harry. "What was the phrase? Something you said when you tapped your wand against the wall to get into the Gallery?"

"Oh, right," said Harry. He stepped forward, shoulder-to-shoulder with Cedric, and looked Hagrid straight in the eye. "We seek refuge."

"Yeh what?" said Hagrid, and then a note of dawning comprehension came over his face. "Oh! Never thought I'd hear that one. Musta been, oh, thirty years at least, since I thought about those things. Groundskeeper before me mentioned it, even said it was important. Dunno what they're for, but Ogg made sure I kept 'em on me."

Harry was almost bouncing on his toes with excitement as Hagrid opened one half of his coat, digging around a very deep pocket for what felt like minutes. "Oho!" said Hagrid happily as he drew out a short, thin golden chain. The burnished metal gleamed in the firelight, and hanging from the loop of gold were four small, ornate, triangular keys.

"I don't believe it," said Hermione breathlessly.

"Could I…?" asked Harry, holding out his hand. Hagrid, with no hesitation at all, turned over his hand and dumped the keys into Harry's waiting palm. The metal was warm against his skin, the keys heavy.

There was a knock at the door.

Everyone froze, and Fang started barking. Harry stuffed the keys into his pocket.

"Hagrid?" The voice was deep and commanding. "Open up, please. We're Aurors, and we need to ask you a few questions."

"Yeh lot need to hide," said Hagrid, staring at the door, his tone serious.

They sprang into action, but there was nowhere to go. It was a mass of silent confusion for a few seconds.

"Be right there!" said Hagrid loudly, making frantic shooing gestures at the rest of them.

"There's only one door, Hagrid!" whispered Cho furiously.

Harry pulled out the Cloak. "Everyone into the kitchen, I think we can hide…"

Cedric, Cho, and Hermione piled into Hagrid's small kitchen, Daphne a half-step behind, and Harry threw the Cloak over them. They squeezed themselves up against the cabinets.

"No good," whispered Harry. "Daphne, I can see your legs."

"Let us in now," said the deep voice from outside the hut.

Harry cursed, looking around frantically. He saw a chance. "Come on!" he grabbed Daphne's hand, yanking her to her feet, drawing his wand with his free hand in the same motion.

Hagrid was moving to the front door, casting nervous glances behind him.

"Harry, what – " Daphne squeaked as Harry pulled her into his arms, drawing her tight.

"Just go with it," he said, pointing his wand at the small window high above Hagrid's sink. "Alohomora!" The window popped open.

Now for the tricky bit. Faster than he ever had before, he tried to force-but-not-force his way into the particular kind of lopsided mental state it took to do what he was trying to do. To his surprise, he slipped into it easily.

His grip tightened around Daphne's waist, and he pointed his wand behind him. Arresto Momentum.

Daphne, to her credit, stifled her shriek before it became too loud. They shot out the window like a cannon, Harry twisting in the air, pulling his legs up to keep from clipping the edge of the window. As they cleared the window, Daphne pushed against his chest, and for a split second Harry thought she was attacking him, but it quickly became clear she'd thought one step ahead of him: the ground came rushing up, and, separated from Daphne, Harry threw out a hand and dipped a shoulder, hitting Hagrid's pumpkin patch in a skidding, flailing roll.

Harry popped to his feet, dirt and the remains of a pumpkin sloughing off his jeans. He grinned. "That was bracing."

"Shhh, keep your voice down." Daphne was all business. She hadn't gotten to her feet yet, and was cradling her left arm.

"Are you okay?" Harry moved over to her – pitching his voice low, and knelt beside her.

"I'm fine," she snapped – but quietly. She craned her neck towards Hagrid's cabin. "Can you hear what they're saying?"

"No," said Harry. "You reckon we should move closer?"

"Yeah, I want to hear what they're…" Daphne trailed off, and then her head snapped up and she jumped to her feet.

Harry saw it a second later. Wandlight, coming down the grounds towards Hagrid's hut. "Another Auror, you think?"

"Maybe," said Daphne, edging back away from the hut. "Can't risk staying here."

Harry looked left and right, and pulled a plan from the ether. "Let's back up into the Forest, and then cut across to the Lake. We can make it to the castle from there."

"Okay," said Daphne. She glanced back at the hut. "Do you think the others will be okay?"

"They have the Cloak," said Harry. "They'll be fine." He said it to convince himself as well as her.

It was well and truly dark in the forest. The night noises of insects and wind rustling through the trees was far from comforting – the fact that they were running from something cast everything in a sinister light. Daphne kept looking around uneasily, and after a minute, she pulled her wand out.

"Better safe than sorry," she murmured. "Think we can chance a bit of light?"

"I wouldn't," said Harry, picking his way around a stump. "The moon's not bad, and light attracts attention."

They were quiet for a moment. A dog barked in the distance. The snap of branches when Harry stumbled was very loud in his ears. After a minute, he balanced his wand on his fingertips and said, "Point Me." The wand spun in his hand, quivering and finally settling on true north. Harry hummed, using his hand to estimate an angle away from the wand.

"We should head right, now," he said. "The Lake's that way."

Daphne frowned, her expression shadowed in the slanting lines of moonlight coming through the trees. "You just know that?"

"I know a lot of spells," said Harry.

"I'm beginning to realize that." They started walking again. Daphne held a branch aside for Harry. "You have more than a few secrets, don't you?"

"And you have just the one," said Harry. "I wonder what it is."

"Harry…"

"I know part of it already," he said, "and I don't want to pry or anything, but…"

"Harry."

"… it's just, now that you know more about me, I figured – "

"Harry!" Daphne threw out a hand and stopped him in his tracks.

"What?"

She moved her hand forward and pointed. "Look!"

He followed the line of her finger, pushing his glasses up his nose and squinting. In the distance, dancing in and out of sight through the small gaps in the trees, was a small but noticeable red-gold light.

"The phoenix," said Daphne, a current of strong emotion threaded through her voice. She took a step towards it.

The light receded, flickering in the distance. Daphne let out a soft, almost anguished cry and darted forward.

"Whoa, hold on, wait!" Harry followed, grabbing her shoulder. "We can't just… I mean, I want to find it too, but…now?"

"Yes, now!" she snapped, whirling to face him.

"Why? Why is it so important to you? It can't just be the Rooms." Harry let out a frustrated breath of air. "You just learned about them yesterday. And yes, that's what I'm looking for. The Gryffindor room, the Hall of Honor, I think the phoenix that lives in the Forest could be a clue, or know how to get there, or something."

"Then you want to find it too. Great, come on," she said, tugging on his arm, and Harry reluctantly fell into step beside her as she strode forward.

"It's personal for you, though," said Harry.

"Yes, it is," she said, glaring at him sidelong as they crashed through the underbrush. "And I can see you'll not let it go until I tell you."

Harry held his hands up defensively, but didn't deny the charge. "I... admit I can be nosy." Harry thought back to yesterday, to spying – there was no other word for it – on Cedric and Cho, and felt a flush of shame. "I'm trying to work on it."

Daphne was quiet a moment, her eyes intent on the light in front of them. It seemed to be ever on the edge of their vision, always on the brink of disappearing. Harry could practically taste Daphne's anticipation.

"It's a family thing," she said at last. "Before Astoria was around, before I had a stepdad, it was just my mum and I. We had it a bit rough for a while, but we were happy."

"What happened to your dad?" asked Harry, ducking under a tree branch.

"That's what I'm trying to find out," said Daphne grimly. "She refuses to tell me who he was. Adamant. Won't budge. No matter how much I beg. She knows it's killing me, not to know. She has to see how much it just… wrecks me." The hard edge of pain, both raw and dull with repetition, crept into her voice.

"Oh," said Harry, kicking himself for that being the only thing he could think to say. "I don't quite see, though, how…"

"I'm getting to that part," said Daphne. They hopped over a small stream, the light looking a bit closer, though still receding. "The only thing she'd ever say was that they went to school together, and he was a Gryffindor. Years ago, I stole her journal. She'd ripped out huge chunks of it. She must have hated him, I think. Or loved him a lot. I don't know."

Her voice was sad, now.

"There was only one part of her journal that said anything about him: 'Daphne keeps asking about her father – how can I tell her about the man who showed me phoenix song, and then turned my heart to ash? What if Daphne follows in his footsteps?"

"Was she a poet, or something?" Daphne didn't react, and Harry felt a twinge of guilt for teasing her when she was opening up. He quickly changed the subject. "You don't think she was just worried about you getting Sorted into Gryffindor?"

"It's all I have to go on, Harry," she said.

"And even if there really is some connection, are you expecting the phoenix to, you know, tell you? I know they're supposed to be quite smart, but…"

"Harry, I know," said Daphne, eyes still locked ahead of them, focused on the light. "I know all of that. I've thought about it a thousand times. You know the first thing I thought of when Cedric showed us his potions setup? I thought, maybe if he's that good, I could bribe him into brewing me Veritaserum and feed it to my mum. I thought that. I just… I have to know. I have to believe it's possible."

Harry let that roll around his mind as they moved through the dark trees. "I can appreciate that. If it were me… I think I'd have to know, too."

"Thanks," she said, and then stopped dead.

The phoenix was just there. It had turned around, and it glided through the trees in front of them, no longer a diffuse light, but a reality. Harry took an unthinking step forward. The phoenix was magnificent. It glowed with some inner radiance, its red-gold feathers sparkling and majestic, its body moving with sinuous grace as it lazily flew just a few feet off the ground.

It looked back. The glittering coal eyes were alight with sharp intelligence.

"Hello, Fawkes," said Harry, his voice coming out in an awed whisper.

"It has a name?"

"He, actually, and yes. Aberforth has a story about being saved by him, once. Apparently Fawkes helped the Order out of a few jams."

"He is smart, then," murmured Daphne. "Maybe…"

"Good and evil smart, Daphne, not people smart."

Fawkes turned, his long, red tail swishing behind him, and he took flight, moving away.

"No, wait!" cried Daphne. "Please!"

Fawkes looked back, and those coal eyes held an unmistakable warning.

Daphne didn't hesitate, but Harry did, reaching out to stop her. "He's going deeper in the Forest. It's getting really late. We still don't know if Cedric and the others made it back okay."

She just looked at him, her eyes big and pleading in the moonlight. "Harry…"

Harry grimaced, and folded like a cheap card table. The thrill-seeking part of his mind was already rubbing its metaphorical hands together in glee. "Fine. But carefully."

They ran after Fawkes.

The phoenix outpaced them, and soon Harry and Daphne were truly running, the footing treacherous in the darkness.

"Should we… split up?" said Harry, panting, his breath coming a bit ragged. He swung around a bush, then jumped over a fallen log. "Try to… box him in?"

"No," said Daphne, a few steps ahead of him, zigzagging through a copse of scraggly, bare pines. "We'd just get – oh!"

Daphne stumbled a halt, her body twisting madly, and Harry skidded to a stop. Daphne's arm – her left one, was tangled behind her somehow. Harry approached and jogged to a halt in front of her.

"What happened?"

"Hit something," said Daphne, hissing in pain.

"I can't see…" Harry muttered. "Ah, screw it. Lumos." Harry squeezed his eyes shut at the brightness, then opened them fractionally. Daphne's arm was held up, dangling and wrapped around a strand of what looked like thin, white rope.

Harry moved behind her, looking for a good position try to untangle it. "Looks like you caught something. What even is this?" He reached out, prodding the rope and found it sticky to the touch.

"Harry." Daphne's voice was dead flat with a very, very serious undercurrent of fear. He looked up. She wasn't looking at her arm, she was looking around them.

The harsh light of Harry's wand revealed a scene straight out of a nightmare. The thin strand around Daphne's arm led up into a tree, where it joined another strand, and another still, a tapestry of gauzy white. A tapestry that was repeated on every tree Harry saw around them.

Webs.

His mind curiously blank, he flicked his wand at a point above Daphne's arm. Diffindo. The strand of web severed, and Daphne's arm came free. She cradled it to her chest with a stifled cry of pain.

"We have to get out of here," she whispered.

Wildly, almost shockingly, Harry had to stifle an actual laugh. No shit. He reached for something – a spell, a bit of knowledge, an escape route – and found his mind just empty. Blank.

He heard rustling in the treetops, and skittering from the darkness surrounding them.

Daphne screamed. He acted. In the half-second it took to raise his wand, his mind now clear, not blank, it occurred to him that it was hard to act, for him, until there was something concrete to act against.

Which there was. Harry dragged his wand up in a vicious arc and roared "Protego!" The shield that sprang into being extinguished the light of Harry's wand, but it was strong and it covered them both. Even as it formed, golden and glowing, a chittering, wiggling thing hit the top of it, a mass of hair and legs and far too many eyes. It was the size of a large dog.

Daphne screamed, a high note of pure terror, but brought her wand up even as she did so. "Petrificus Totalus!"

The acromantula's legs snapped together, and the force of the spell blew it back into the air, twisting madly as it arced away into the darkness. Harry's shield…vibrated. Harry could feel it resonating. Something about Daphne's spell interacting with it… he dropped the shield. He could feel more acromantulas closing in on them, could feel hundreds of eyes glittering in the dark.

Harry swept his wand from side to side. He glanced at Daphne. "We have to run. I'll cover us. Incen – "

A heavy weight slammed into his midsection, and he went flying towards the ground. Instinctively, he shot out his hands to protect himself…

…and his wand went spinning into the darkness.

For a long, timeless moment, Harry simply couldn't believe it had happened.

And then time sped up, he hit the ground, his palms stinging with the impact. He rolled, coming to one knee, turning towards Daphne. She was on her feet, her eyes wide, pupils dilated with sheer adrenaline. Two acromantulas circled her, both easily as large as Fang.

"Arania Exumai!" Daphne's hand was shaking, but her aim was true, and one of the monstrous spiders went crashing down to the ground, its many legs buckling.

The other, with an almost casual jump, hopped on her back. She screamed.

Harry scrambled to his feet.

He had a bad moment, about a quarter of a second, where he considered running. He didn't see any spiders behind him, and he had nothing, no wand, no weapon. But he took a step forward, and then another one, and then he was sprinting.

He hit the acromantula in a flying body-tackle, clotheslining the giant spider across the middle with his arm. They hit the ground together, the thing shrieking, its hairy, spindly legs flailing for purchase as Harry grappled with it, crushing it to his chest, trying to contain it any way he could. It was a wriggling, writhing mass, and Harry almost wanted to close his eyes when the thing's head came into view, its too-many eyes all staring, unblinking, as it struggled.

Harry felt something dull and wet and painful along his side, and glanced down to see one of the acromantula's front legs had opened a long gash across his ribs. Harry cursed, tightened his grip, and spat in the thing's face.

Another sound, this one a roar, filled his ears, and Daphne's voice, yelling something unintelligible, rang out as a heavy whump knocked Harry off-balance. The spider fared worse, one of its legs crumpling in on itself as it whirled to face its new attacker.

Breathing hard, blood staining the shoulder of her t-shirt, dripping down her arm, Daphne held a heavy stick menacingly above her head.

"Thanks," said Harry, coughing, wincing at the pain in his chest at the motion. "Your wand?"

"Lost it," she said grimly. She took a swing at the spider and connected, bashing its head, and it dropped without ceremony, unmoving.

"Nice one," said Harry, struggling to his feet. Daphne reached out and hugged him tightly, just for a second, and Harry gripped her back. It was a relief, just to touch another person and know that they were there.

"We need to run," said Daphne.

"We need our wands," said Harry. "Find yours and I'll use it to summon mine."

Daphne looked to the tree where her arm had gotten tangled. "Should be there somewhere." They started to limp over.

They made it about halfway when another three spiders dropped out of the tree onto them.

Harry lost track of Daphne as he went down, trying to roll away from the chittering monstrosity on his back. He felt the thing's mouth bite at him and catch the fabric of his shirt. Daphne cursed from somewhere behind him. Harry rolled onto his back and tried to slam the spider into the ground with little success. This time, it was Harry who was caught around the middle, six legs wrapping, dragging. He flailed, felt his heart beating so hard he thought it might explode.

His hands scrabbled for purchase, found some sort of root, grabbed it, snapped it.

He felt himself being dragged away.

I can't believe it ends like this. Eaten by a giant spider. Sirius wouldn't think that was a very cool death at all. Dumbledore would be so disappointed that it wasn't more symbolic…

He felt, rather than saw, a warm, golden light. It was very far away, and at the same time, very, very close. Harry looked up, and through the large, hairy legs of the spider, he saw phoenix fire. He imagined, from this great distance, that he could see Fawkes's eyes.

Help me.

A flash. The spider screamed and released its grip. Harry reached out blindly, and, thinking he was going to grasp the warm tail feathers of a phoenix, was surprised, instead, to feel something cool and metallic.

Opening his eyes, standing up, Harry looked down, not quite believing it. The sword was long and straight, double-edged and deadly sharp. It looked like something from another age, another time. The light of the moon caught the blade, and it shone, the hilt a filigree of gold and rubies that somehow felt comfortable and secure in his hand. The moonlight revealed writing engraved just above the hilt in a fine, elegant scrawl.

Godric Gryffindor.

Harry turned. The spider that had been dragging him off had righted itself, and was preparing to leap at Harry again. It leapt. Harry pivoted neatly and caught the spider with the tip of the sword, and it skewered itself on the blade, sliding down nearly to the hilt. Harry jerked back in surprise, and the blade bisected the creature. Harry felt almost no resistance.

Without sparing a moment, he turned and sprinted back. Daphne was cornered, the other two spiders pinning her to the tree. She kept swinging her stick at them, but they never quite came close enough.

He didn't slow down; he just bent his arm high, like he was chopping wood, and drove the sword down in a broad arc, severing four of one of the spider's legs and sending it toppling to the ground. The other acromantula reared to face him, and Harry planted his feet, gripping the sword two-handed, and swung it like a baseball bat.

The giant spider's head fell to the forest floor with an audible thump, the limbs and body wiggling to a stop on top of it.

Daphne dropped her stick and sank to the ground, moaning, clutching her shoulder.

It caught up with Harry, too, at that moment, and suddenly the sword was heavy, his side was burning, and he felt weak, cold, and about to keel over with adrenaline burnout.

"How… where….?" asked Daphne weakly as she looked at the sword in Harry's hands.

"Fawkes," he replied.

And the phoenix in question was there, bursting into existence in a torrent of flame. He crooned, a single, pure note, and Harry felt his heart settle, his blood warm, and his hand steady.

"Fawkes," repeated Daphne. Her eyes were bright. She held out a hand, stretching forward…

And in another burst of flame, Fawkes was gone.

Daphne's hand closed around a single feather.

Harry let her sit there for a moment, just looking at it. She was blank-faced, but Harry could see a maelstrom of emotions brewing under the surface.

He held out his hand. "C'mon, we have to go. It's still not safe. Your wand?"

Daphne looked up, dazed. Then she nodded, got to her feet. With infinite care, she tucked the feather into her shirt pocket. Limping, she made her way around the tree, hands reaching out to prod at the disturbed dirt and broken sticks on the ground, evidence of the struggle that had so recently taken place.

After a minute, she made a little sound of relief and straightened up. Without speaking, she walked over and slapped her wand into Harry's hand. "You know any first-aid spells?"

Harry shook his head. "Nothing that would cover this." He grimised at the way Daphne cradled her shoulder - it looked bad.

Daphne's wand felt strange in his hand, but it responded to him. Harry pointed it out into the darkness. "Accio wand." A few seconds later, Harry's wand came whizzing back, and he felt a surge of his own relief as he held it. He handed Daphne hers. As Harry stepped back, he caught Daphne looking at the Sword.

"I don't understand," she said, her hand going to the shirt pocket where she'd stowed the phoenix feather. "Was it all just a test? A challenge to get the sword?"

"Magic and symbolism," said Harry, hefting the Sword of Gryffindor, looking down its length, the black blood of acromantulas dripping from its edge. "You can't just find the Sword. You have to prove that you deserve it."

"And what am I, in this?" asked Daphne softly, dangerously. "Someone for you to save?"

"No," said Harry, wiping the sword on the bottom of his shirt, which was itself stained with his own blood. He nodded at Daphne's shirt pocket meaningfully. "You got your answer."

"I suppose I did," said Daphne, her hand closing over the pocket again, almost protectively. "I just wish I knew what it meant."

"Let's go back," said Harry. "That was enough adventure for one night."

"Understatement," said Daphne.

Harry used another Four-Point spell. "Castle's this way."

They started to walk, but after a minute Daphne stopped. "We're leaving a pretty noticeable trail." She was right, Harry saw. Daphne's shoulder was bleeding freely, and the gash in Harry's side was no better. Harry lit his wand and saw a trail of blood-splattered plants and branches behind them.

"That's no good," said Harry. "We can't let anyone know we were out here. Especially the Aurors."

"I'm open to suggestions," said Daphne.

Harry thought about it for a minute.

In the end, they stood back-to-back. Daphne held Harry's hand and guided him as she walked forward and he walked backwards behind her.

Every few seconds, Harry would wave his wand and mutter an Evanesco.

And so they made their slow, painful way back to Hogwarts, vanishing the trail of their blood as they went.

Author's note:



For now, I've decided to leave the summary as-is. Too many people told me they were fine with it. I will, however, give out the prize I promised in the last chapter.

So, congrats to JukedSolid, whose summary idea was the direct inspiration for the new one I've been tinkering with:

"A great wizard courts danger, uncovers ancient mysteries, hordes secrets like gold, guards true friends closely, comprehends magic on a deep level, and always knows where his towel is. Harry Potter has all the makings of a great wizard. A re-imagining of books 1-7 with an AU twist or two."

I may or may not end up actually using it. As you can see, it still needs a bit more... something. I also want to give a shout-out to RookieReads, whose thoughts on summaries in general were quite insightful.

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, hence, I don't have a lot of money.

AUTHOR'S NOTES: Hey look! The sequel is up! For those of you who haven't read The Code, you should if you want to understand this story. I mean, it's not vital, but it probably would help.

Summary: Bill is a contact for spies overseas, and sends the information they gather in coded messages. Draco is Bill's code breaker, and he's back in England for seventh year, but there are a lot of surprises in store for him, like the niece he never knew he had. Now, he finds himself opposing the Dark Lord, in the process of getting disowned (the paper work takes forever to go through), rescuing Harry from his relatives in a convertible, getting captured by Death Eaters, and meeting, very briefly, one Sirius Black, who comes back to life. He is also discovering exactly what having friends is like. Luckily, Bill will be there for him, and no, it is NOT slash for those of you who are wondering.

Chapter 1

Letters

Bill waited outside the Headmaster's office, a letter from Draco Malfoy in his pocket and another from the Minister of Magic in his hands. He had received it a week ago and it detailed a network of informants that the Minister wished to set up to keep tabs on the growing threat of Death Eaters across seas. It was relatively simple.

There were to be spies in other countries, not actually spying in on the meetings, but keeping their ears open, and getting in contact with the types of people that would be working for the Dark Lord. They would then give their information to a contact in that country, who would be in charge of coding the messages. They would then be sent back to England to a decoder, who would translate the messages and then relay them to the Aurors.

Fudge had finally wised up and put Dumbledore in charge of the operation, and then had asked Bill to be a contact in France. Because Bill had gotten married in early June, and because he had found out in late June that Fleur was pregnant, he had been wary to join. The consequences would be doubly harsh if he was caught because he had escaped Voldemort once already, and he had a family depending on him. In hopes to persuade him, the Minister had allowed him to pick any code breaker he wished, as long as said decoder was willing and that he cleared it with Dumbledore.

That was why he was in Hogwarts in early August, waiting for the Headmaster.

The door opened and Dumbledore appeared at the door, stepping back to let him in.

"My apologies for making you wait, William," he said, smiling in greeting.

"Perfectly alright, Headmaster," said Bill, taking a seat and then taking the proffered lemon drop. Dumbledore regained his seat behind his parchment covered desk and looked at him with twinkling eyes.

"And how is your lovely wife today?"

Bill got that feeling of absolute wonder in his chest whenever the words 'your wife' were used to describe Fleur and he knew he must be beaming.

"She's doing well, though Mum is already trying to fill our house with loads of baby things."

Dumbledore got a knowledgeable look in his eyes. "I suppose she must be ready for her first grandchild."

"And everyone else is ready to be an uncle or an aunt," agreed Bill. "We'll have the most spoiled child in all of England."

Dumbledore chuckled, but then grew serious. "I suppose you are here to give me your answer about being a contact then."

"Yes," said Bill. He took a breath. "Fleur and I talked it over, and we decided that I will go to France to be a contact."

"Thank you, William," said Dumbledore sincerely. "And the Order will be checking in with Fleur everyday when you are gone, and there is always a room for her in Headquarters."

"Thank you," said Bill.

"Have you decided who you want to be for your code breaker yet?"

"Actually, yes," said Bill. "That's part of the reason why I'm here."

"Who is it?" asked Dumbledore.

Bill took a breath. "Draco Malfoy," he said.

Dumbledore actually looked surprised, his eyebrows shooting up to his hairline.

"Draco Malfoy?" he asked, and then he leaned back in his chair, stroking his beard thoughtfully. "I suppose there is more to this than currently meets the eye?"

"You were the one that said that there was something about him," said Bill. "What made you say that?"

"Minerva says that it's wishful thinking," said Dumbledore. "That I feel that I have failed Lucius in some way and so now I am trying to see some good in his son. Perhaps she is right. Lucius was…he was smart, but very misguided. I tried, in the past, to reach out to boys like him, from families with extreme prejudices, but my efforts merely worsened the conflict, especially with Tom. I think those students could tell that I was more concerned about those who were being oppressed, than those who were being told to do the oppressing."

"Were you?" asked Bill.

"It is easier to feel pity for the oppressed than for the oppressor, even when the oppressor is just as much a victim. It took me a while to see that and that cost me many students."

"But Draco?" asked Bill.

"Yes," said Dumbledore. "Draco…

"Hello, Madam Pince," said Dumbledore, smiling at the sight of the strict librarian who was glaring over the rim of her spectacles at the noisy students.

"Albus," said the librarian, then to the children, who were at the tables, "If you are not going to be quiet, you can leave!"

"Oh, come now," said Dumbledore soothingly. "They are just children. They learn by interaction."

"Yes, but this is a library," said the witch in a huff. "Is there anything I can do for you?"

"Yes, actually," said Dumbledore. "I'm looking for the Rare Magical Creatures Limited Edition."

"Someone's already using it," said the librarian.

"Indeed?" asked Dumbledore, wondering if someone had come to the same conclusion he had. He tried to think of who it might be. Hermione Granger was a sharp one, and no doubt she would be interested, but Richard Terrington, Ravenclaw 5th year, was the smartest boy in the school.

"Right over there," said Pince, pointing to a far table.

Dumbledore could make out a slight figure and he nodded his thanks and walked over to the lone student. As he drew closer he could make out the white-blond hair of Lucius Malfoy's only child, who would be a second year, same as Harry.

The boy was small for his age, small and skinny when he had every right to be overweight with how much his parents could afford, but then again, Narcissa had always been preoccupied with her own figure and the amount of food she ate, and he wondered if it could have been passed down to one so young.

And Draco Malfoy did look very young, sitting in the lotus position on the chair, the large book in his lap, writing on a piece of parchment. His hair was slicked back, as usual, but now it was coming undone and was slightly mussed. Dumbledore pulled out a chair and sat, watching as the cold grey eyes turned to him, a faint flicker of surprise shining for a second underneath all of the ice, but then it was gone.

"Hello, Mr. Malfoy," said Dumbledore kindly.

"Headmaster," said the child, nodding ever-so-slightly, like an emperor nodding to a subject. "Is there something you would wish to discuss?"

The child was wary, he could hear it in his polite, formal tone.

"Not at all," said Dumbledore. "I was just about to look at the same book as you."

He gestured to the tome in the child's lap and Draco raised an eyebrow, a trait he no doubt picked up from Lucius. "Indeed?" he asked. "Do you often have urges to read Choski?"

There was a slight derisive tone in the voice now, and the boy pulled out a new piece of parchment, writing rather hastily now, and although Dumbledore couldn't read the words, he could see that the handwriting was still incredibly neat.

"Not at all," said Dumbledore again, "I actually try to steer away from him as much as possible because I find him rather dry, but I believe that the book might actually be useful during these times."

The boy smirked slightly, closed the book, and handed it over. "Happy reading then, Headmaster. I am quite finished with it."

Dumbledore watched as the boy packed up his things and then walked away without another glance in his direction. He followed the child with his eyes as the second year paused by another table, leaning in to whisper something and then walking out the door. A few seconds later, the table erupted in shouts and accusations and Dumbledore had no doubt that Draco Malfoy was the instigator, though he would not be able to prove it.

Pince sorted the students out and Dumbledore turned back to the book, looking up basilisk in the index and then turning to page 366. To his surprise there was a piece of parchment tucked between the pages. He pulled it out and read the perfect script of one Draco Malfoy.

I recommend a supplementary reading of Burgeson's Guide to Ghosts, page 37.

Intrigued, Dumbledore found the other book and turned to the suggested page, skimming down the lines until one caught his attention "…it has been theorized that the gaze of a basilisk would indeed affect a ghost negatively, causing a condensing of the 'grey matter' that makes up the incorporeal figures as well as paralysis..."

Dumbledore put the book back, stroking his beard as his thoughts turned to one certain blond haired boy.

"I still don't know what it is about Draco," said Dumbledore, once he had finished relating the story to Bill, "and there have been other incidents, but they are so few I haven't been able to pinpoint what it is that is off about him. The only thing I know is that he is quite clever, cleverer than what he shows."

"That he is," said Bill, unable to stop the smile from slipping onto his face.

"What is it?" Dumbledore asked. "You know what he is hiding."

Bill nodded and started to explain. "Draco decoded my board last year."

"He what?" asked Dumbledore, leaning forward slightly.

"He figured out that I was sending a message through my instructions on the board," said Bill. "He even figured out that Tonks was impersonating a student."

"And yet you didn't tell anyone?" asked Dumbledore. "You could have been exposed." His tone was grave and slightly disappointed; Bill knew why. It hadn't been just his life he was risking, it was Tonks as well.

"I realize that it might seem incredibly foolish not to tell anyone," said Bill, "but he couldn't tell, and even if he could expose me, I don't think I would have told you, or anyone else for that matter."

Dumbledore looked extremely serious now. "And why is that?" he asked.

Bill paused for a moment. "Because he's not as bad as everyone thinks he is," he said finally. "He's not even as bad as he could be."

Dumbledore studied him for a moment. "I think you had better start from the beginning."

Bill nodded. "As you know I took the Ancient Runes position to pass on information from the Death Eater meetings to Tonks, who was disguised as a Ravenclaw girl in my class, by means of a code on my blackboard. Draco Malfoy was also in my class, and my brother and his friends told me many horrible things that Draco had done, painting him to be a miniature Lord Voldemort."

Dumbledore half-smiled at that, though not in amusement, and Bill continued.

"I started noticing things about Draco, things that went against my original view of him. When the attack on the Quidditch Pitch occurred, I stayed with Draco while Severus had to make an immobilization potion. Because Madame Pomfrey had given him some rather potent pain medications, he was talking more than he usually did, finally saying, right as he passed out, 'There's a riddle on your board. R is for Riddle. M is for Malfoy.'"

"That's when you found out that he had decoded the information," said Dumbledore.

"Right," said Bill. "So, I immediately went inside and did what no other teacher had done before. I looked into his file and found something rather startling."

"And that was-?" prodded Dumbledore, completely enthralled in the story.

"You have copies of the files in here, don't you?" asked Bill. "I think it's better if you checked for yourself."

Dumbledore flicked his wand and a cabinet opened, a file flying out and landing on his desk. The Headmaster opened it, scanning the pages and then going still. Bill watched as he stared a moment, then flipped back to the beginning.

"All E's," said Dumbledore, looking up at Bill. "Six years of straight E's. It's impossible to receive those grades on a fluke."

"That's what I thought," said Bill. "Of course at that time I saw it, there was only five years of straight E's, but it still proved a point."

"He was purposefully getting E's," said Dumbledore.

"Exactly," said Bill. "And because he had figured out my code, I knew he must be incredibly smart, so I went to visit him in the infirmary, and told him that I knew, and we reached a sort of truce."

"His silence for your silence," said Dumbledore.

Bill nodded, remembering Draco saying those exact words.

"I started working with him on the Persian Runes, which have never been translated," said Bill. "I've been trying to translate them for a while now, but haven't made any real progress. I knew that someone as smart as Draco would love the chance to help decode the runes, and it would also give me a chance to talk with him."

"You wished to be his friend," said Dumbledore.

"Not then, no," said Bill. "I was more intrigued that he managed to go for nearly his entire school career without anyone noticing that he was smarter than he pretended to be, and I was also curious as to why he didn't tell anyone about the board. I realized then that because he was so smart, he would have undoubtedly realized that Voldemort is not worth following, although his childhood beliefs came into conflict with his revelations. I also knew that if he did join Voldemort, we wouldn't stand a chance against the Death Eaters."

"He's that smart?" asked Dumbledore.

Bill nodded. "I had to teach him the Slavic Runes before we could get started on the Persian ones, and he knew it cold in half an hour, and then he corrected me on a verb conjugation." Bill shook his head, smiling at the memory.

"You think of him as a brother," said Dumbledore, his insight once again proving to be astounding.

"I do," said Bill. "I'll be the first one to admit that sometimes the kid is frustrating, and some days you just want to slap him for being such a git, but all over, he's an okay kid. Perhaps he's a little misguided, and he has these rather large trust problems, but for the most part I think he turned out rather well, considering the circumstances."

"I see," said Dumbledore, nodding thoughtfully. "Do you think Draco will want to be your code breaker?"

"I think so," said Bill. "He did, after all, save my life."

Dumbledore's blue eyes lit up. "Your angel," he said.

"Yeah," said Bill. "He showed up out of nowhere, and took on the whole Death Eater army. It was rather impressive."

"I can imagine," said Dumbledore. "I'm also impressed that you managed to befriend him. It's not every day a Slytherin will risk his neck to save someone else, especially when there is no benefit to the Slytherin. He must think highly of you."

Bill laughed. "I don't think Draco thinks highly of anyone," he said. "But, I am his friend."

"Well then, I approve Draco Malfoy as your code breaker, though it might be difficult to send the letters under Lucius Malfoy's gaze.

"He doesn't live with Lucius anymore," said Bill.

"Oh?" asked Dumbledore.

"He was disinherited and is on his way to being disowned," said Bill. "Apparently he refused Voldemort's offer at the initiation at the end of summer."

"Severus didn't mention that Draco was there," said Dumbledore.

"Draco asked him not to," said Bill. "After he refused Voldemort he met Snape at his house to give him a letter to deliver to me, since Draco told me about the initiation and he knew I would be worried. Severus says that Draco created quite a stir. Apparently Voldemort wanted Draco to be his heir and Draco told him to 'screw himself' though in less polite terms. He then Portkeyed away."

Dumbledore looked highly amused at that, no doubt figuring the exact phrasing used, but then turned serious. "That would be enough to get him disowned," he said, "though it usually takes quite a few months to get the papers through. Do you know why Voldemort wanted Draco as his heir? Does he know that Draco is highly intelligent?"

"I talked to Severus about that," said Bill grimly, "and the closest he understands it is that Draco answered the initiation questions correctly and that Voldemort seemed impressed that he didn't cry after repeated administrations of the Cruciatus."

Dumbledore's eyes darkened at the mention of the curse, but then he looked down at Draco's file still on the table.

"It seems to me that Draco is a very good candidate to be your code breaker. Have you contacted him yet?"

"Well, no," said Bill a little sheepishly. "You see, I don't really know where he is right now."

"Really," said Dumbledore.

"He left the country soon after refusing the Dark Mark," said Bill. "He sends me letters every week with information on the Persian Runes that he is working on, but I have no clue where he is. I've tried to trace the letters, but I haven't been able to. I was wondering if you could take a look at them."

"Of course," said Dumbledore.

Bill pulled out Draco's letter and handed it to the Headmaster.

"I'll let you know what I find as soon as possible," Dumbledore promised.

"Thank you, Headmaster," said Bill getting up. "Good day."

"And to you too, William."

Draco frowned as he stared at the walls covered in Ancient Runes, or rather, the large sheets of paper he had taped over every wall in his apartment were covered in Ancient Runes. He stood in the middle of his living room, his left hand holding the black marker and his right tapping out his pattern as he thought.

The room was messy. Sheets of paper that had already been marked all over were strewn about in piles and the bookshelf was filled with volumes on Calculus, advanced mathematics, psychology, chemistry, and computer technology. There was also a keyboard in the corner, which was the only piece of furniture he personally owned because the flat had come already furnished.

He flipped through one of the notebooks Bill had given him, skimmed it over, and then scribbled hastily in one of the margins on the paper. He stepped back and frowned again. It still didn't work.

"Merde," he said out loud.

He was answered by the ding of the microwave and he gave the wall one last look and then walked into the kitchen. The smell of some sort of fake pasta meal wafted from the microwave and he opened it, then pulled the plastic container out and shut the door. On the way back to the living room he grabbed a plastic fork and began to eat.

It was a pre-cooked meal, one which required only three minutes in the microwave, and it was one of the only meals Draco could make. He had no doubt that he could become proficient in the kitchen, but he honestly thought doing so was a waste of time. He had nearly starved the first week he was in the States because he didn't take the time to make anything, but then he had discovered the freezer section in the grocery stores and the meals that were already cooked for him. So what if they tasted strangely like plastic? It was nourishment.

He returned to staring at the walls again, the flimsy carton in his hand, working as he ate. This one dialect had been giving him trouble. To be truthful, the whole entire thing had been giving him trouble, but then again, he was trying to decipher an Ancient Rune dialect that had never been translated before.

He sighed. Maybe it was time for a break. He had been doing Ancient Runes nearly the entire time he had been away from England, only taking breaks when his head had been too muddled, like it was right now. The first time he had turned to physics, publishing a paper on the speed of light. The math world had eaten it up, astounded by the equations that had disproved so many theories on the speed of light. 'A break-through' one famed mathematician called it. Draco disagreed. It was in all honesty, a piece of crap. All he had done was disproved theories; he had made no conclusions of his own.

The second time he had taken a break was when he had first moved to this apartment. It was in some middle-sized city and it did little to block out the noise from the street. Draco had been sorely tempted to cast a silencing charm, but magic is easily traced and he wanted to remain inconspicuous. So Draco had purchased the keyboard and spent all night playing and tinkered a bit with composing. He had finally published a symphony that was picked up by quite a few orchestras, and was even played in Carnegie Hall as well as the Sydney Opera House. The critics raved about the piece, and this time Draco agreed. It was quite beautiful.

It was these two pursuits that gave him enough money for the apartment, and quite a bit extra, which Draco was thankful for. He had no intention of drawing money from his Gringotts account because money is a whole lot more traceable than magic.

The third time, he had toyed with creating a supplement to counter Veritaserum. He had finally come up with a theoretical potion, but without a real potion lab, he couldn't test it.

He sighed again. Perhaps it was time to look to another subject for a while. He did have an idea for a jazz piano piece that had been lingering in the back of his brain. He walked back into the kitchen and threw out the remains of his meal, and than drank a glass full of water, or rather, a paper cup full of water because he hated washing dishes.

He glanced at the paper-covered wall in his kitchen, also covered in Ancient Runes, and then he tore a section off and ran back into the living room, taping that section under the one he had just written. He stepped back, his mind going into overdrive. He picked up his marker and began to write.

He stopped four hours later when night fell and the light disappeared from the windows. He took the opportunity to close the curtains and turn on his lights, and then took down the covered pages and put blank ones up.

The tapping at the window halted his progress three hours later and he pulled open the curtain to see an owl at his window, a letter tied to its leg. For a minute he stared. No one knew where he was, why on earth was there an owl at his window?

He left the window to grab his unregistered wand from the bedside table, just in case there was something wrong with the letter. While all magic is noticeable, the unregistered wand insured that it couldn't be traced to his name. He opened the window and took the letter from the owl, which immediately flew away.

Draco closed the window and made sure that all of the curtains were closed tightly, before screening the letter for any curses or hexes. There were none. He slowly opened the letter, surprised to note that it was written in the Syrian dialect, the same dialect he had used to write his letters to Bill. He knew it couldn't be coincidence, but how did Bill find him?

He read the letter.

Hi Draco,

It's Bill. Since you're probably wondering how I managed to get this letter to you, I didn't. I had Dumbledore trace your letters.

Draco felt a surge of disbelief and betrayal. He had Dumbledore trace his letters? What was going on?

Listen, don't jump to conclusions and don't get mad. I'll explain, starting from the top. There is a growing threat of Death Eaters overseas, and Fudge is finally doing something proactive. There are to be a network of spies in the other countries, mostly undercover Aurors, and they will be listening in the right places in hopes to pick information up. They will relay the information to a contact in the country, who will code the messages and send them to a code-breaker in England, who will translate the messages and send them on. Fudge had put Dumbledore in charge of the whole project, which is why I told him about you. I'm to go to France, to be a contact. And I would like nothing better than to have you as my code breaker.

Draco re-read the last paragraph, wondering if Bill was serious. His last stint as a spy didn't go so well, but he could tell Bill was serious. He read on.

I realize you might be rather upset that I told Dumbledore about you, and you have a right to be; it is not my secret to tell. However, even if I wasn't going to be a spy, and even if Dumbledore wasn't in charge of the mission, I think I would still tell Dumbledore that you are a genius. I asked Severus about what happened that night, and I know that Voldemort wanted you to be his heir, and that you said no. I want someone on the faculty who knows exactly what is happening so that they can keep an eye out for you when you return to school, and since I don't know if you are returning to school, I want someone who has a lot of influence to keep tabs on you, hence Dumbledore. And yes, that would be my Gryfindorish traits of worry to much coming out.

Draco had to smirk at that, even if he didn't know what he felt about Dumbledore knowing his secret. If someone on the faculty had to be told, he was glad it would be Dumbledore because he held no respect for the other teachers. He read the rest of the message.

If you do wish to be my code breaker, meet myself and Dumbledore at the Three Broomsticks on Thursday at ten in the morning. If not, don't come. I really do hope you are doing well, Draco, and stay safe, alright?

Sincerely,

Bill

P.S. Dumbledore was quite impressed at your hiding skills. He tried to trace the letters, but couldn't even figure out what continent you are on, so we had to settle with merely figuring out how to send a letter back to you.

Draco knew that in sending the letters to Bill, it would be possible to send a letter back to him if Bill really looked hard enough, or asked Dumbledore, but that was part of the reason he had sent them. He wanted to know if something major had happened.

He sat down on the coach, thinking it over. He had planned on going back to England for school, had more than planned on it. He already had a flat in London, near Diagon Alley, and he had gone out shopping for furniture already with the money he had made from his paper and his music. While he needed the time away from the war and everything else to figure things out, he never planned on hiding away for the rest of his life. He needed to go back. He was a part of the conflict.

He didn't want to join the Order of the Phoenix, at least, not yet. He wasn't ready for the Order just now, didn't feel like associating with the type of people that, up until a few months ago, he hated. But this was Ministry run, and he firmly believed that the Ministry needed to be a part of the war. So, he got up, and began to pack.

It was Monday right now, and he could manage a flight back by either tonight or tomorrow. That would give him plenty of time to settle into his new flat, and then he would meet Bill and Dumbledore on Thursday. He took one last look around the life he had created for himself, and didn't feel at all sad about leaving. It was time to go home.

Well, what do you think so far? Things will definitely heat up in the next chapter (Draco runs into Lucius, not literally, but still unexpectedly). Review!

Chapter 2

Meetings

Draco easily made his way through the crowded streets of London. With his natural grace and the way he walked, as if he expected people to get out of his way, most people did unconsciously step away from his path and so he made surprisingly good time to the Leaky Cauldron.

It was a warm summer day and he was wearing baggy jeans slung low around his hips and a tighter, olive green t-shirt. A pair of ordinary black sneakers was on his feet and the necklace Bill had given him was still around his neck. His wand was shoved into his deep back pocket so he wouldn't get odd glances and his reflective sunglasses hid his gaze from the other pedestrians. Even though he was in the middle of Muggle London, he still kept alert for anyone who might not be on the best of terms with him. He had arrived in England on a plane and had gone straight to his flat, and he had yet to venture into the magical world, but it was only common sense to be on his guard after angering Voldemort as he had done.

He veered off from the rest of the Muggle crowd and entered the Leaky Cauldron. He could see the owner squint at him, as if trying to make out who he was, but Draco had changed since he had been gone.

He was a couple of inches taller, so that he was now on the taller side of average as opposed to the shorter side, and his frame had filled out a bit with muscle so that he wasn't quite the stick figure he had been before. His hair was still the tell-tale white-blond, but it was cut shorter, though it still hit the back of his neck and his bangs often fell into his eyes. He was also wearing Muggle clothes, and that was something a Malfoy just didn't do.

He pulled off his sunglasses, because the room was already dim making the shades a hindrance instead of useful, and the owner immediately knew who he was because his cold, grey stare had not changed.

"Mr. Malfoy, sir," he said with a slight smile.

"Tom," said Draco nodding politely. He glanced at his watch and saw that he had time to spare before meeting Bill and Dumbledore so he sat at the counter. "A coffee," he said, knowing that the Leaky Caldron had one excellent Columbian bean. Besides, it was still morning and much too early for anything stronger, though he suspected he might need one later tonight.

Tom efficiently fixed his coffee, sliding the mug over with a small pitcher of cream and a tray of sugar. Draco avoided both of them. Tom was always in bartender mode, and so he moved his glasses over to Draco and spoke while working.

"Haven't seen you in a while, Mr. Malfoy," he said. "Seen your father around quite a bit though, catching the Portkey to France and what not, but never you."

Tom was one of those people who noticed things. When Draco was younger, Lucius often took him with him to France on business trips because Narcissa wasn't exactly mother material. They would often pass through the Leaky Caldron, which was one of the few places that had direct Floo to the Manor, because it was conveniently located by Diagon Alley and the International Portkey platform.

Sometimes, before or after the trip, they would sit at the counter while Tom spoke meaningless small talk with Lucius. Draco would listen in, noticing how Tom could read the slight inflections in Lucius' tone and body language. Then Tom would fix a drink for Lucius, varying the amount of alcohol by how tense Lucius seemed, and then he would look over to Draco and study him as well, and then would either give him a hot chocolate or butterbeer.

That, Lucius would say afterwards, is a smart man.

"I've been away," said Draco, deciding from the heat of the cup that the coffee was too hot to drink, and while he could have cooled it with a charm or asked for an ice cube, he merely waited.

"Where abouts?" asked Tom, his brown eyes sweeping over him.

"The States," said Draco, frowning into his cup.

"Work?" asked Tom, knowing that they had no family over there.

"No," said Draco. "Just felt like getting away."

He had to consciously tell himself to relax; his muscles were tensed in the knowledge of today's meeting, and he took a breath and then a sip of coffee. The Floo flared to life in the fireplace a few feet behind him and he turned, more out of a self-preservation instinct than an actual desire to see who it was. He shouldn't have looked behind him. Lucius Malfoy stepped out of the flames along with another associate, and as Draco was turned, his father locked eyes on him.

Draco froze for a split second. He could see his father's grey eyes widen marginally, but that was it. The grey eyes than slid past him and over the rest of the costumers without acknowledging his presence. He turned back to the counter, feeling a spike of terror, and grasped the tabletop to hide the faint trembling in his hands. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, calming himself down, but the next instant he froze again when his father stepped up right next to him.

"I'll have a drink, Tom," Lucius said, completely calm.

Draco's hand slid unobtrusively to his back pocket and he pulled out his wand, then held it under the table in a loose dueling grip just in case his father did try something.

"Of course," said Tom. "Pull up a chair and it will be right up."

No, don't, thought Draco urgently, but his father sat down gracefully in the stool left to him. They were only inches apart, and Draco's entire body was tensed, his right hand curled in a fist so that his nails dug painfully into his skin, and yet his father seemed completely unaffected.

"Off to France again, then?" asked Tom idly to Lucius, while he pulled out a few bottles of this and that.

"Unfortunately, yes," said Lucius, and although Draco strained to hear anything that might show that his father was at least a little bit affected by his son's presence, he gave none.

He suddenly realized what he was doing, sitting next to his father, a Death Eater, who had no qualms killing innocents, so why would it be different with his son? He got to his feet, only barely hiding the fact that he wanted to bolt out the door. He pulled a few coins from his pocket and placed them on the table.

"Thank you, Tom," he said, keeping his voice steady and cool, much to his surprise and relief. "I'll be leaving then."

He started to turn, but Lucius' hand shot out, clamping about his forearm in a painful vise, halting Draco's escape. Lucius plucked the wand from unresisting fingers and placed it on the counter.

"Sit," he commanded, and although his voice was quiet, it was still as hard as steel. Years of obeying his father to the letter kicked in and Draco sat back down, his father not releasing his arm. If anything, the grip tightened, as if Lucius could read his son's mind and knew that he wanted to run.

"Fa-," Draco started, and then he cut off, because Lucius was disowning him and he had no idea what to call him.

It was only a slight consolation that Lucius tensed ever-so-slightly at Draco's blunder as well, though, whether it was from the fact that Draco started to call him 'father' or stopped himself, was impossible to tell.

"Give me one reason why I shouldn't have you killed right now," Lucius said harshly and Draco started a moment, wondering why Lucius had said that so everyone could hear, but then he realized Lucius had spoken in French, so he reverted to his native language as well.

"Parce qu'il y a des témoins," Draco said calmly back. (Because there are witnesses.)

For a moment, Lucius' grey eyes bored into his own, searching for something but Draco didn't know what he was looking for.

"Pourquoi?" asked Lucius, an urgency in his voice that Draco had never heard before, but it was only one word, one question 'Why?', and so Draco may have misheard. Either way, he was unable to answer.

The next moment he was sure he had misheard the inflection, because Lucius pulled himself straighter and stared down at him with that unreadable expression in his eyes. The transformation was so smooth, Draco began to doubt that he had ever heard the inflection, and he was left to wonder if Lucius really did feel nothing for his only son, but then Tom placed Lucius' drink in front of his father. Draco could tell by the color that the majority of the drink was made from Ogden's strongest firewhiskey. He couldn't tell if his father was affected by his presence or not, but Tom knew that Lucius was.

He felt his lips twitch slightly at the sight of the drink, and he couldn't help but look up at his father. Lucius glared and let go of his arm, and although his father's grip had been painful, Draco found himself missing the connection.

His father drained the glass in one long swallow and avoided looking at him again, placing the empty tumbler on the table and then motioning for his associate should follow him out the back door into Diagon Alley. Draco watched them leave, hoping his father would look back at him, even just once, but Lucius didn't even glance his way.

Draco watched the door slam shut, and then turned back to his coffee, wishing that he had ordered something stronger, even though he wasn't much of a drinker, not after Narcissa. Tom seemed to know what he was thinking, because he took Draco's cup and added a shot of whiskey and then a bit of sweetened cream, stirred it and warmed it with a charm, and then set back in front of Draco.

"Thanks," said Draco softly, picking up the cup and taking a long swallow. It was just at the right temperature and he could feel his muscles starting to relax. A glance at the clock showed him that he should be leaving now, so he drank the rest of the coffee and added a few more coins onto those he had already left.

"See you, Tom," he said, pocketing his wand again.

"Good-day, Mr. Malfoy," said the bartender.

Draco crossed to the fireplace, taking a pinch of the green powder in a box on the mantle and throwing it in the flames. "The Hogs Head!" he ordered and stepped in.

While he could have just Flooed straight to the Three Broomsticks, he didn't feel like stepping blind into a place that was so busy. The Hogs Head, while a shady and not quite legitimate establishment, was a place where no Death Eaters would gather. Yes, it was an area where illegal business ventures and trades took place, but the people who operated them were simply after money and power. They liked to keep their endeavors off Ministry radar, and so they kept hate crimes and Death Eaters far away.

He stepped out into the grimy pub and ignored all of the glances turned his way and headed for the door, stepping out once again into the bright sunlight and the warm breeze of mid-morning. He pulled his sunglasses back on and joined the crowds of wizards and witches out shopping or just enjoying the sun. Even though he was in Muggle clothes, he blended in with the other magical teenagers, who often wore Muggle clothing in the summer or on vacation.

He entered the Three Broomsticks at exactly ten o'clock, after having spent a few minutes watching the store. There were only a few people inside, as the breakfast rush had just already cleared out, and so Draco immediately spotted Bill Weasley talking with Madame Rosemerta at the counter. Bill's head jerked up when he entered, and Draco found his lips twitching up in his familiar smirk at his former-teacher's large grin.

He pulled off his sunglasses even as Bill came over, pulling him into a half hug and then letting him go, knowing that Draco disliked physical proximity.

"Look at you!" he said, checking him over to make sure he was alright. "You've got your hair cut and you're wearing colors, will wonders ever cease?"

Draco shrugged, trying to keep his lips from smiling. It was good to see Bill again.

"So, this is a 'yes', then?" asked Bill.

Draco shot him a look that said 'what else am I doing here?' and Bill laughed.

"'Course," he said. "Well then, come on in the back. Madame Rosemerta, we'll like those drinks in about half an hour."

"They'll be ready," said Rosmerta and Bill guided Draco towards the back room.

"Just so you know, there's an Auror in there too, and they'll have to do preliminary questions and all that, alright?"

"I thought there might be," said Draco. "I assume he's on the Order than?"

"Maybe," said Bill, but he was smiling, which told Draco his assumption was correct. "He'll be the one that you send your decoded letters to."

"You mean, assuming they let me join," said Draco, who knew that much more than just an ability to break codes would be judged.

"They'll be idiots if they don't," said Bill, and then they reached the door, and Bill opened it, guiding Draco in first.

Draco made sure to note the exact layout of the room. There was a large table, behind which Dumbledore and a large black Auror sat. Draco instantly identified him as Kingsley Shacklebolt. There were a few windows, but they were covered with curtains, and the only exit was through the door that Bill had just shut behind him. The former professor was now warding it as well.

"Come in, Draco," said Dumbledore kindly, his blue eyes twinkling up at him.

Draco hesitantly walked forward, keeping his eyes on the Auror, not really trusting the man. He pulled out the chair across from the two and sat, sprawling out slightly to show he was unaffected, but in a way that would allow him to jump to his feet at a moments notice.

This was bad. He was basically picking sides right now in a conflict that may not be resolved for another ten to twenty years, perhaps longer. If he was only looking out for himself right now, he would be staying far away, but there was Bill to consider as well. He eased his mind by reminding himself that in being a decoder he would be privy to information that might be useful in keeping himself informed. He was making it his business to know what was going on.

Bill took the seat next to Draco and Dumbledore leaned forward, obviously ready to start this meeting.

"I am very glad that you accepted Bill's offer, Draco," said Dumbledore. "I must say I was surprised when he cited you as his code breaker, but now that he has explained things, I must give you an apology. I never thought you would turn out as well as you did. You are quite a surprising young man."

Draco merely raised an eyebrow and Dumbledore continued.

"That aside, I assume you understand the position you are undertaking?"

"Yes," said Draco.

"Good," said Dumbledore. "I realize that you are uniquely suited to this sort of job, but there are still things we need to discuss, and some questions we need to ask. That is why Kingsley is here. Draco, meet-,"

"Kingsley Shacklebolt," said Draco, turning his eyes on the large Auror. "Graduated second in his class, and became the youngest Auror to ever become an Auror first class, which he achieved nine years ago. He is on the Auror Retrieval Squad, and, until recently, was in charge of protecting the Muggle Minister. Now he is in charge of the logistical aspect of the new operation the Ministry is calling 'Code Recon'. He joined the Order," here Draco broke off, studying the man, "oh, anywhere from two to one and a half years ago along with one Nymphadora Tonks."

Kingsley raised his eyebrows, his neutral expression still in place and Dumbledore's eyes twinkled even more. Bill was grinning at Kingsley in an 'I told you so' manner.

"I don't know," said the Auror to Bill, in a slow, deep voice. "He didn't tell me my middle name."

"You don't have a middle name," said Draco, turning back to Dumbledore. "I assume this involves Veritaserum?"

"It does," said Dumbledore, "but I assure you, we will only ask the necessities."

"Let's get it over with then," said Draco.

"Your wand," said Dumbledore, and Draco pulled it out and set it on the table, though every instinct told him not to.

Kingsley pulled out a vial of clear liquid and went to walk around the table, standing next to Draco and measuring out three drops. Draco's fingers tightened around the armrests on the chair, but he opened his mouth and the Veritaserum was placed on his tongue. He swallowed, the potion leaving a slight aftertaste that wasn't unpleasant, just disconcerting.

Dumbledore waited a moment, something that Draco was extremely grateful for, so he could calm himself and then Dumbledore asked the first question.

"Fawkes isn't the first phoenix you've seen, is he?"

Draco had to give Dumbledore props for the question. Not only was he checking to be sure that the potion was working, he was also seeing if Draco had the ability to fool the truth detectors.

"No," he said, allowing the potion to work since there was no sense in fighting it. "I saw one in the zoo in Paris when I was younger."

Dumbledore smiled at that and then the real questions began. "What is your full name?"

"Draco Lucius Malfoy."

"Are you in the service of Lord Voldemort?"

"No."

"Have you ever been in the service of Lord Voldemort?"

"No."

"Have you ever attended a Death Eater meeting?"

"Yes."

He noticed the slight flicker in both Dumbledore's and Shacklebolt's eyes.

"Have you ever participated in a Death Eater meeting?"

"No."

Dumbledore relaxed marginally.

"Have you ever wished to join the Death Eaters?"

"Yes."

"Have you ever been offered a position as a Death Eater?"

"Yes."

"What was the offer?"

Draco hesitated a split second, wondering if they knew, and for a minute he struggled with the potion, but then his mouth was talking. "The Dark Lord wished me to be his heir."

There were no shocked looks so Draco figured they already knew.

"Did you accept the position?"

"No."

"Why not?"

Draco paused again, but this time because he didn't know how to answer.

"I don't believe that following a Half-blood in order to purify the bloodlines is exactly sound doctrine. I don't believe that innocents should be killed for sport. I don't really believe that Purebloods have anything over Mudbloods, and I don't wish to be a servant to a power-crazed madman."

"But you were to be his heir. Didn't you want that sort of power?"

"I did. That's why I said no."

Dumbledore nodded at that, not thrown off by the twisted logic. "What do you mean 'I don't really believe that Purebloods have anything over Muggle-borns'?"

"I know that facts," said Draco. "Probably better than anyone else, but don't expect me to change a life time of beliefs in the space of a day."

"Fair enough," said Dumbledore. "One more question. Do you have the Dark Mark?"

"No," said Draco.

"May I examine your arms then?"

Draco put his arms on the table and Dumbledore cast a revealing charm, but nothing happened. Draco started to pull his arms back, but Dumbledore gently latched onto his left wrist and peered at his forearm.

"Are you alright, my boy?" asked Dumbledore in concern.

Draco looked down to see bruises where his father had grabbed his arm and the blue marks were in the shape of Lucius' hand.

"I'm fine," he said quickly, and truthfully, but then Bill was there as well, looking at the marks.

"Who did that?" he asked.

Draco battled with the Veritaserum, knowing that the potion was almost worn off, but it was still potent enough so that he answered honestly.

"Lucius," he said, and then silently cursed as both Bill and Dumbledore looked up at him in alarm and Kingsley sat forward a little.

"I passed him when I was coming here," said Draco. "He wanted to talk, I didn't, so he stopped me. That's all."

"I thought you said," began Bill but Draco cut him off.

"He doesn't," he said. "It's the first time he ever hurt me, and he didn't even mean to, alright?"

Bill searched his eyes but decided that he was telling the truth.

"Alright," he said.

Draco sat back, crossing his arms loosely over his chest to hide the bruises from sight. There was a knock on the door and Bill went to open it. It was Madame Rosmerta and Bill took the tray from her, and then shut and re-warded the door. He came over and set the tray down on the table and handed out the butterbeers.

Draco took the offered bottle; Veritaserum was not an easy thing to go through.

"Now then," said Dumbledore, once he had taken a sip of his own drink, "this brings us to the next topic we need to discuss, your safety, Draco. Since you will be attending school, and because you are a Slytherin, you are in grave danger from your housemates, who no doubt know of your refusal to join the Death Eaters."

"I am quite capable of handling myself around Slytherins," said Draco. "Even if they may be wishing to cause me bodily harm."

"I don't doubt it," said Dumbledore. "Why, I remember a time just last year when six Slytherins were found in the Charms room with no memory on how they had gotten there, and then a few months later, three more Slytherins were hospitalized with rather dark curses, however, a school is not a place where you should have to constantly be on your guard, especially not at night. That being said, I wish to congratulate you."

"On what?" asked Draco, suspiciously.

"On becoming this year's Head Boy," said Dumbledore.

Draco blinked, and Dumbledore continued to speak.

"Of course, it won't be official until you get your letter in the mail, but best of wishes ahead of time."

Draco finally found his voice. "You're joking, right?" he asked.

"Is something the matter?" asked Dumbledore.

"Everything's the matter!" said Draco. "What the hell are you thinking giving me Head Boy? I'm not Head Boy material, I-I don't even…," he found himself at a loss for words, turning in Bill's direction and hoping that his former professor would speak up in his behalf, but Bill was grinning at him excitedly.

"You'll do great," he said encouragingly.

"What?" asked Draco in disbelief. He turned back to Dumbledore with one last appeal. "Give it to Potter," he said. "He actually cares about things like that and he'll be an excellent example to the other students. I honestly don't give a shit about it."

"I think you will find," said Dumbledore, "that I am rarely wrong on my choice for Head students. Besides, you were a Prefect, you saved Ginny Weasley's life last year, and you receive steady, acceptable grades."

"I frequently use my position as Prefect to achieve my own goals that are always detrimental to the school, I have had more detentions than any other three students combined, I don't interact well with others, I am not on good terms with any professor in this school, and I have instigated or participated in every single one of the thirty-eight fights these past six years, save two. I am the worst candidate you have for Head Boy!"

"Why are you afraid of taking the Head Boy position?" asked Dumbledore simply, once his tirade had ended.

"I'm not afraid," said Draco.

The blue eyes were unconvinced and Draco leaned back in his chair, glaring at the Headmaster.

"I'm not Potter," he said finally. "Just because I have not joined Voldemort does not mean you should expect great or good things from me. If given the opportunity, I will use my power as Head Boy to further my own gain and ensure my own safety first and foremost. Now, with that in mind, if you still wish me to be Head Boy, I will accept."

Dumbledore did not look daunted. "I suppose I will just have to keep a close eye on you then," he said. "Make no mistake, Mr. Malfoy, I am aware that you are not an innocent, however, at this time, you are the closest thing to a neutral party we have, and I think that your presence as Head Boy may help this school stick together longer. Besides, this way you will not have to charm your curtains at night. The Head Boy has his own room and you will be quite safe from any one who wishes you ill."

"Very well," said Draco, inclining his head but not thanking him for the position.

"I am looking forward to the school year," said Dumbledore, with a slight, challenging smile on his lips, but it was gone the next instant. "There is another thing we must discuss and that is the job you will be doing for the Ministry. There are seven other code breakers, besides yourself, and there will be a mandatory meeting early next week so that the basic code breaking techniques can be taught."

"Unnecessary," said Draco.

"Is that so?" asked Dumbledore.

"I broke Bill's code without any instructions," said Draco. "I think I can handle his letters."

"These codes will be longer," said Dumbledore, "more intricate. And besides, it will give you a chance to meet the other code breakers. You will be in attendance."

His voice meant that there was no room for arguments, Draco had heard it from his father many times, and so he merely nodded. "Is that all?" he asked.

"One more thing," said Dumbledore. "I would like to offer you an invitation into the Order of the Phoenix."

Draco started to speak up, shaking his head, but Dumbledore held a hand up, stopping him.

"I know that at this time you probably have no wish to join the Order, and I respect that. However, the invitation is standing. If you ever change your mind, or if you need help for any reason, we will be there. Remember that Draco."

Draco was surprised by the show of generosity, not expecting such quick acceptance and it must have showed on his face because Dumbledore smiled kindly down at him.

"I will," Draco said, regaining his cold mask.

"Not at all," said Dumbledore, "thank you for accepting this role. I will owl you about the particulars of the code breaker meeting once we have all of the details finalized."

The meeting was over and Draco was relieved. He stood, placing his empty bottle on the table and pocketing his wand.

"Thank you, Headmaster," he said, inclining his head an inch.

"I'll walk you back," said Bill, getting up as well.

They exited the shop, back into the bright sunlight that made Draco's eyes water and he pulled his sunglasses back on.

"Where you headed?" asked Bill.

"The Hogs Head," said Draco. "Catching the Floo to the Leaky Caldron and then to my flat."

"You've got a place to stay already?" asked Bill surprised.

"I've had it for a while now," said Draco. "It's in Muggle London."

"Really," said Bill. "You're living as a Muggle?"

Draco shrugged. "I figured it was the safest place to be. Besides, I'm going to buy a car I think."

Bill laughed and then grew serious again.

"You don't have to answer this if you don't want to, Draco," he said, "but if you weren't going to join Voldemort, why on earth did you go to the initiation?"

Draco paused, but then answered. "The next day was my birthday," he said. "Because I was still a child, my bank accounts were joint vaults with my father. If he had known I was going to turn traitor, he would have pulled all the money out. If I turned seventeen without him pulling the money out, all of it would be mine."

"So what happened?"

"Well, that's the cool thing about birthdays," said Draco. "As soon as it is midnight day of, you're officially your new age."

"So, you stalled for time," said Bill. "To get the money."

"You sound disappointed," said Draco.

"A million galleons isn't worth your soul, Draco."

"How about ten million?" asked Draco.

Bill stopped and looked at him incredulous. "Ten million?" he asked.

"Cash," said Draco. "I've got another ten million in investments, and a chateau in France worth five."

"Twenty-five million," said Bill, in tones of one who can't really believe what he is hearing.

Draco smirked at him. "I'm a Malfoy, Bill," he said. "At least, I am for a little longer, and we like to keep financially secure."

"Financially secure meaning enough galleons to buy a new car whenever the fancy hits you?"

"Actually, I'll be paying in pounds," said Draco. "I did rather well when I was out of the country."

"Do I even want to know?" asked Bill. "It wasn't illegal, was it?"

"'Course not," said Draco. "I wrote a paper on physics and it's become required reading at a few colleges and then I composed a symphony."

"Magician's Symphony," said Bill suddenly. "That's the one, isn't it? It's been playing non-stop over the wizard's radio."

"That's the one," said Draco. They arrived at the Hogs Head and Draco gave Bill a slight smile. "It's good to see you again, Bill."

"You too, kid," said Bill. "But just so you know, next time, I'd rather you safe, than twenty-five million, alright?"

"Alright," said Draco.

Bill walked back to the Three Broomsticks and entered the back room once more. Dumbledore and Kingsley were waiting for him.

"Well?" Bill asked, raising his eyebrows and taking his seat again.

"He's not what I expected," said Kingsley carefully. "So, he really is a genius then?" Dumbledore had told the Auror, just because he was the one controlling the logistics of the operation and he needed to know.

"Yeah," said Bill.

Kingsley shook his head. "Can you imagine what Lucius would have done if he knew? I can just see an anti-Muggleborn campaign under the reason that once you're inbred enough you can become a genius."

"I actually think that's why Draco kept it a secret," said Bill.

"It is Lucius' loss that he was not enough of a father to Draco to realize how smart he is," said Dumbledore. "Though I was always under the impression that they were close."

Bill shook his head. "From what I gather, Lucius isn't around a whole lot and is extremely manipulating, but there are…moments when he does behave as a father should. Draco is more confused on what he should feel, and he dislikes that feeling, which is why it's best not to mention Lucius around Draco. He can be quite defensive."

"What of his mother?" asked Kingsley. "Surely she would know."

Bill hesitated, than noticed that Dumbledore looked grave as well.

"Narcissa isn't mother material," said Dumbledore. "She was very self-centered, even as a child, and she has only grown worse. She also took up whiskey at a very young age. It really is tragic. She had such great potential."

The three fell silent. If there is one thing a child needs, it is the love of the mother.

"Well," said Dumbledore, "I have many things to do before the end of the school year, namely breaking it to the staff that Draco Malfoy will be Head Boy."

Bill grimaced. "They're sure to have conniptions."

"Without a doubt," said Dumbledore, "and I am afraid that Minerva won't speak to me after this. Alas, I do so enjoy talking to that woman."

He sighed, but got up, and the other two followed.

"Fleur wants to pick out baby names," said Bill.

"And the Ministry no doubt wishes me back," said Kingsley.

They said their farewells at the door and went their separate ways.

Well, what do you think? Leave a review and let me know. Next chapter, we see Draco in action after an attempted kidnapping.





3. Plots and Planning

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would not be working overnights. Blah!

AUTHOR'S NOTE: I'm sorry. I am most sincerely sorry. Wow, I feel like such a terrible person for not updating. It's been almost three weeks, and I know how it sucks waiting for a story to update, and the stupid author is just dallying around. Gosh, doesn't it just make you mad?

For an apology, I will update the next chapter in two days. Thank you to everyone who updated, I love you all!

Ravus Umbra was several things. First and foremost it was a bar that served some not-so legal drinks, but because it was located in the heart of Knockturn Alley, England, it was never really reported. Secondly, it was a hot spot, where a lonely witch or wizard could find company for the night, whether in the bar itself or in the rooms upstairs that could be rented by the half-hours. Even if no company was required, it was where any Dark Wizard who thought he was worth something was sure to show his face in hopes to attract attention to get a job, or to issue a threat. Thirdly, it was a gathering place for certain transactions that wouldn't hold up in the light of day, or to the light of a Ministry official's desk lamp.

Perhaps most importantly however, it was a place where information could be bought or sold and that was why Draco Malfoy walked into the Ravus Umbra late Friday night.

Now that he had ventured out into the wizarding world - on Thursday in his meeting with Bill - he wasn't going to hide any longer. A smart person who had earned the ire of the Dark Lord would generally keep a low profile, keeping away from magical areas, however Draco was not a smart person. He was a genius.

He knew that openly showing his face would cause attention, and that the spies that worked for the Dark Lord, and for his father, would report back to their masters that Draco Malfoy was strolling about Knockturn Alley like it was his own backyard, and that would throw them off. They would immediately be looking for something that was making him so bold, and while they kept back, suspecting a trap, Draco would spread his name about the Underground as a person not to mess with. It was an offensive defense.

Draco also needed his own information. Not being in the house with his Death Eaters parents meant that he was no longer privy to the information they brought back with them. Draco didn't like being kept in the dark about the Dark Lord's movements, especially now that he had made his loyalties, or lack thereof, known. He wanted, needed, to keep tabs on what was happening.

No one really noticed him as he entered with the hood of his black cloak pulled over his head because it was raining outside, but then he pushed it back, revealing his white-blond locks and piercing grey eyes, and several nudges and whispers were exchanged as he made his way to the counter.

"What'll you have?" asked the bartender, giving him a once over as the rest of the bar went back to whatever illegal activities they were previously involved in. "Are you even old enough to drink?"

A few characters at the bar, the ones trying to drown whatever sorrows they had in whiskey and wine, guffawed at that, then proceeded to mope again.

"An Acid Sherbet," said Draco. "Iced."

It was a rather alcoholic beverage, but a fashionable one, served in a metal cup and a metal straw because the rum that was used would eat through a ceramic cup it was that acidic. That was why the sherbet was added. Once the sherbet had melted into the liquid, it was safe to drink. Having a taste before the sherbet had completely dissolved was a good way to disintegrate one's tongue.

"Are you trying to spoil that virgin mouth of yours with your first drink?" asked the bartender, sliding the cup over to him once he was done fixing the rum and sherbet just right. Those at the bar chuckled again and Draco merely repressed the urge to roll his eyes. He was no virgin and he had experienced his first drink at eight and his first hangover at eleven, though he was careful never to get drunk again.

"Actually," said Draco coolly, giving the bartender a frosty glare, "I'm here on business. I'm looking for Gremian Fitch."

"Over there," said the bartender, jerking his head in the direction of the far corner. "The one with the pint of whiskey."

Draco didn't bother thanking the bartender, instead going straight for the craggy-faced man at the table in the back corner. He had, of course, known who Fitch was before he entered, but informants like to keep a low profile, and putting a face to a 'squealer' was not only going against the black market code of conduct, but it was also a sure way to turn all of the informants against you, which is something no one wants. So Draco had asked, just to keep up appearances.

He sat across from Fitch, putting his drink down in front of him, and waited until the balding head turned up in his direction.

"So's?" the man asked in a slight slur. "Yur 'ere, huh? Was almos' thinkin' yuh wouldn't show up. Not many people askin' yur sorts of questions. Why yuh's wanna know anyways?"

"Mr. Fitch," said Draco smoothly. "I believe that I paid you to answer my questions, not to ask some of your own."

"Alrigh', alrigh'," said the man, "I'll tell yuhs." He stared down at his drink, as if trying to remember what he was supposed to be talking about.

"The Dark Lord's actions," Draco prompted. "Starting the night of June 5th."

"Not really a lot to tell that yuhs can't find inna paper," said Fitch. "Few raids on Mu'bloods here an' there, an attack on the Minis'ry when Aurors captured some of his men, an' some threats. Mostly, tho' he's going after fam'lies who are against 'im." Fitch trailed off, but then looked up at Draco with a gleam in his eyes.

"What aren't you telling me, Fitch?" asked Draco.

"D'yuh really wanna know?" asked Fitch. "It'll cost yuh sometin' extra."

"I am well prepared to meet your price," said Draco, "but I am not paying out more money to hear some sort of made-up babble about the Dark Lord's love interests. You'll say your bit, and I will pay you if I deem it important."

Fitch was too drunk to object and he leaned in closer, motioning Draco to do likewise. Draco inclined his head forward just an inch, still keeping one eye on the other wizards in the bar.

"The Dark Lord is ver' angry with one of 'is mos' trusted followers," said Fitch. "Don' know why, but he's ver' angry, angry to the point of leavin' her out for Azkaban. 'Course, he broke 'er out again, but he was provin' a point, yuh know?"

"Who did he prove a point to?" asked Draco, now thoroughly intrigued. The Dark Lord purposefully leaving one of his inner circle to the Aurors and Azkaban?"

"Bellatr'x Lestrange," whispered Fitch. "T'wasn't in the papers that she was caught. Fudge kept it quiet, savin' the story to 'lection time, so he get re'lected again as Minister, but the Dark Lord got 'er out again two days later, so the story never went public-like."

Bellatrix Lestrange? On the bad side of the Dark Lord? Now that was something worth looking into.

"My thanks, Mr. Fitch," said Draco politely, making sure that his face did not betray the fact that he found the tidbit of information as interesting as he did. He would have to talk to Severus, maybe he would know what had happened with his Aunt. He placed five galleons on the table and slid them over to the drunk.

"Ten," said Fitch.

Draco raised an eyebrow. "What?"

"I wan' ten," said Fitch.

"I'm afraid not, Mr. Fitch. I am already being quite generous."

"Oh, yuh's father's gonna be even more gen'rous, boy," said Fitch, getting a decidedly evil glint to his eyes.

Draco saw the four men get up behind him by the reflection in the metal cup, which had been one of the reasons he had ordered the Acid Sherbet.

"Mr. Fitch, I would advise you to rethink your actions," said Draco. "You're going to get yourself in a lot of trouble."

"Not nearly as much trouble as you," said Fitch, dropping the drunken, faltering speech. "How much is your father worth? And how much exactly will he pay for you?"

Draco sighed. While the information had been good, he really did not want to have to deal with would-be kidnappers.

He was grabbed roughly from behind, but the man who had grabbed him had latched onto his shoulders around the chair. Draco merely stood and kicked the chair so that the back of the seat caught the man in the groin with a rather large amount of force.

The man doubled over and dropped and Draco whirled around, his wand drawn and held in a perfected dueler's grip. He took out one man in a split second with the ear drum bursting curse, which not only caused intense pain but also a lack of balance and coordination that could take up to a month to be fully restored.

Draco didn't stop after toppling him, but turned to the other two who responded with a barrage of hexes, and Draco reached out with Legilimency to counter everyone they sent his way since they were good enough not to have to speak their curses. In truth, a lifetime spent learning Dark Curses and dueling made Draco fast enough and smart enough so that he didn't need the extra second Legilimency gave him. He could recognize and counter the curse by the color or shape of the magic in the time it took for it to fly to him, but he was not foolish enough to disregard the help of mind-reading. The magic being used was Dark Magic, and so one mistake could be the last mistake.

In the middle of blocking the curses, he sent out two of his own. One hit the man on the left, throwing him backwards with a bolt of lightning that left him convulsing on the floor. The man on the right blocked the curse he sent, so Draco sent another, and another, and another, even sending one to the man who had received the chair to the groin, making sure he stayed down.

The man on the right finally collapsed when an energy-draining curse took hold of him, and then Draco stunned all four of the men. Draco turned back to Fitch, who was too dumbfounded at the fact that a mere teenager had taken out his men to realize he should run. When the thought finally occurred to him to flee, Draco merely petrified him then levitated him on the table. He took the charm off the man's mouth and pried it open with his right hand. With his left he reached over to the Acid Sherbet and sealed the top of the metal straw with his thumb and then pulled it out.

"I don't appreciate being almost kidnapped, Fitch," he said. "Here I was, paying you good money for information, now is that fair that you turn on me?"

He let go of Fitch's mouth and the man started blubbering.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please, don't to anything to me, please!"

"Tell me Fitch," said Draco, "did you think of this little kidnapping scheme all by yourself, or did someone hire you?"

"No!" said Fitch, too quickly. "No one hired me, I swear."

Draco stuck the straw in between Fitch's lips and took his thumb off the top. The acid liquid that had been trapped inside due to the pressure flowed out onto Fitch's tongue and the man screamed and his body spasmed, as if trying to move, but was unable to because of the hex.

The liquid was not as acidic as it could have been, as most of the sherbet had dissolved, but it still stripped the first layer of skin off of Fitch's tongue and mouth.

"Don't lie to me Fitch," said Draco. "It makes me angry."

"Damn you, you little bastard!" Fitch hissed, flecks of blood spewing from his mouth. Draco stepped back to avoid the red liquid.

"A name Fitch," said Draco. "That's all that will save you now."

Fitch shut his mouth. Draco got more acid in the straw and pried Fitch's mouth open by squeezing the precise point on the jaw, then dropped the acid in once more. Fitch screamed again.

"I need a name!" demanded Draco. "Or I swear, I will dissolve your tongue straight through, and then start on your cheeks."

Fitch believed him, and that was all that mattered.

"Alright, alright," said Fitch, spitting out blood. "I don't know his name. All he said was to capture the Malfoy brat and we'd hold him for ransom."

He was lying, or holding something back. Draco could see it in the way his eyes drifted to the side and how his face gained more color.

"Why are you lying, Fitch?" asked Draco.

"I-I'm not," Fitch stuttered.

"Crucio," said Draco calmly.

Fitch screamed. Draco let him yell, sitting back in his chair and picking up his Acid Sherbet, looking at the now melted liquid but deciding that he really didn't want it. He hadn't bought it to drink. He set it back down on the table and took the curse off, ignoring the suddenly uneasy glances he was receiving. Truth-be-told, he could have done much, much worse.

"What did you say Fitch?"

If Fitch was anything, he was a fast learner.

"He was going to take you to the Dark Lord," Fitch hissed. "We were going to make it look like a kidnapping, but then he would take you to the Dark Lord and me and my men would get paid."

Not good. The Dark Lord, or at least one of his Death Eaters, was out to get him.

"What did he look like?" Draco asked.

"I don't know," said Fitch. "It was through letters only."

"So you never met him," said Draco. "Never saw his face or his form."

"No."

"Did he know what questions I was asking you?"

"Of course not," said Fitch indignantly. "That's client confidentiality."

Draco had to laugh silently at the backwards rules of the Underground, where it was quite all right to turn on a client and try to kidnap him, but unthinkable to tell anyone what questions they were asking.

"Very well," said Draco, raising his wand again. "Obliviate."

Normally, the bar costumers wouldn't be phased by such a brawl, or if they were, they would quickly ignore it. This time it took longer for the pub to go back to normal than usual, but that was because no one expected a teenager to possess that sort of power and skill. Draco had proved himself quite well, but he did not say to revel in that sort of tarnished glory. He walked out of the bar and then Apparated away.

Once at his flat, he made himself a cup of tea and sat on his couch, staring at nothing. The Dark Lord was mad at Bellatrix Lestrange, and someone, most likely a Death Eater, had it out for him. He only wished he knew more. Without information, he would have nothing, no clues, no insights. It was like flying blind. The Order at least had Snape.

Now that was a thought, Snape. He doubted, however, that the Potions Master would really tell him what he found out at the Death Eater meetings. He and the professor were not close, contrary to popular belief, and Snape would not trust him enough with the information, which was only prudent. Besides, the Order would not take kindly to him trespassing on their spy. No, he needed another way to get answers, but right now, he couldn't think of any.

He sighed and went into his study, intent on finishing the translation of the Persian dialect he had decoded. Bill would love to see it and as he was leaving for France in a few weeks, Draco wanted to teach it to the former Professor so they could use it in sending messages.

He went to bed early, for him at least, and spent most of the night thinking, but actually got a decent night's sleep in the hours he was out. He woke at six on Saturday, and showered and dressed, and decided that he would actually like school to start soon because he was rather bored. After a while, self-motivation isn't what it once was.

He settled himself for pouring a bowl of dry cereal and setting it on the keyboard along with his music. He had spelled a quill to write out the musical notes as he played, it was just a variation on the dict-a-quill, so whenever he came up with something good he didn't have to stop every three notes to write.

Most people do not wake up at six in the morning on Saturdays, or even seven, so when seven-thirty came around and there was a knock on the door, he was mildly intrigued.

"Hey, Draco, you awake?" came the voice after the knock.

Draco frowned, played a quick glissando, and then called back.

"The hell you doing, Bill?"

"Knocking on your door," came the response. "But shouldn't you already have figured that out? I mean, you are a genius and all."

Draco, out of habit, forced his lips not to smile at that. He got up, grabbed his wand off the mantle, and looked through the peephole before opening the door to admit both Bill and Dumbledore. He shut and locked it, once the two Order members were in the flat.

"Can I get you some tea or coffee?" he asked. Good manners were taught at the Malfoy home, even though the Malfoy's didn't always use them, but this was one of those occasions where etiquette would be followed.

"Some coffee would be great," said Bill.

"Tea, please," said Dumbledore.

"Have a seat," said Draco, gesturing to the sofa and armchairs. "I'll be right back."

Dumbledore sat; Bill didn't. Draco could hear him plinking out the melody he had just written on the keyboard.

"I like it," Bill called into the kitchen. "Another symphony?"

Draco scowled slightly, because now Dumbledore would know that he had written an orchestral movement, but answered anyway, because Bill was his friend after all.

"Just piano," he said. "Maybe a few other instruments for a jazz band."

"Did you decorate the apartment yourself?" Bill asked, now changing topics.

"Hired a designer," said Draco.

"It's nice," said Bill. "I thought you would have gone for the dark, mysterious look though."

Draco smirked at that. The flat was rather…bright. There was an ivory carpet with the navy corduroy furniture, the cherry wood coffee table, and then the abstract paintings and the lamps that were very modern. It was a contemporary look, but done tastefully and with a great sense of style.

"Holy shit!"

The exclamation was from Bill, and Draco got mildly concerned, glancing out the kitchen to see that Bill was not in the living room, but rather down the hall and in the study.

"You did it!"

So, he had found the Ancient Runes taped along the walls then. Draco let the water boil on the stove and walked in, Dumbledore joining them as well.

"The Persian Runes," said the Headmaster, clearly surprised and impressed.

"Yeah," said Draco. "Well, only one of them. But it was the fifth one. You were right when you said they might be out of place, Bill."

"How did you figure it out?" the former-Professor asked, reading the translation over and then turning to Draco, his hazel eyes shining brightly.

"Here," said Draco, opening up a drawer on his desk and pulling out a journal that had his notes in it. Actually, it was the journal Bill had given him as a gift when they first started the ruins.

Bill flipped it open, rummaging through the pages. "Incredible," he breathed. "So it was the grammar syntax of the Gaelic runes."

"Yeah," said Draco.

Bill looked as if his face would split he was smiling so hard. Draco felt a little uncomfortable, he always did around large displays of emotion, but the kettle shrieking in the kitchen gave him an excuse to leave. He put the mugs on a tray, along with cream and sugar, and brought it into the living room where Bill and Dumbledore took their place on the sofa. Draco set the tray down on the coffee table, and than sat across from them in an armchair, taking his own cup of coffee.

Bill was still grinning, even as he poured cream in his coffee, and took a sip.

"So," said Draco, once his guests were done fixing their drinks. "What brings you here?"

Bill's smile faded, and considering how happy he had been a moment ago, Draco felt more than a little wary.

"That bad?" he asked.

"It's not bad news, necessarily," said Bill. "It's more of a…request."

Draco's indifferent and uninterested façade took over, leaving his face completely blank and his expression cold. Bill noticed and fidgeted in his seat, looking over at Dumbledore.

"We are not forcing you to do anything, if you don't wish to," he said. "It's merely something that you could help us with."

"And it is?" Draco prodded, an edge to his voice.

"Death Eaters are guarding Harry's house," said Dumbledore. "Because of the wards, they can't do anything except watch, which is fine with us, however we recently learned of an attack planned by the Death Eaters, and while they cannot go inside the house, they can force Harry out."

"And the attack would be when?" asked Draco, idly staring at his coffee though his mind was already spinning.

"Tonight," said Dumbledore.

"And you want me to go get him," said Draco. He looked up to see their surprised faces. "That is the reason you are here. I sincerely doubt you would be telling me this so I can keep a candle burning for you when you attempt the rescue, which brings us to the main question: Why do you need me to get Harry?"

He raised his eyebrow at them, taking a sip of his coffee as Dumbledore began to explain.

"The Death Eaters have set up wards of their own around Harry's house. Not harmful wards, but ones that would allow them to read magical auras, much like the Ministry detects an under-aged witch or wizard doing magic. Tom has also fallen into the habit of attacking the families of those who oppose him. Just last month, Andromeda Tonks was injured by Death Eaters and Ronald and Molly Weasley were accosted three weeks ago, again by Tom's followers."

Draco looked up at that, making eye contact with Bill, the question in his eyes.

"They're fine," said Bill. "Just a little shaken up."

"Good," said Draco, and then because he had looked concerned, he changed the subject. "And you chose me because the only family I have that will reap the punishments for my actions are my Death Eater family members."

"No," said Bill. "No, it's not like that at all."

Draco quirked an eyebrow and Dumbledore jumped in. "Bill suggested that you might have a means of doing magic that won't be linked to you in anyway."

Yes, his unregistered wand. He had figured that it had been something like that. Draco knew that him going to get Potter would make the most sense, since he did have the unregistered wand, but that did not mean he was thrilled at the aspect of picking up Potter, although this did present an interesting opportunity…

"Alright," he said.

"Alright?" asked Bill, clearly astounded at his easy compliance.

"Don't worry Bill," said Draco, "I'm not completely self-sacrificing yet. I have conditions."

Bill looked a little uneasy, shooting a glance at Dumbledore. The Headmaster actually looked like he had been looking forward to this. Draco wondered if he ever got bored with dealing with people who were willing to lay down their life at the drop of a hat and never being challenged with the tricky alliances of Slytherins. Of course, he did have Snape, but Snape spying on the Dark Lord was also a rather Gryffindorish thing to do.

""What are they?" asked Dumbledore.

"I want to talk to Professor Snape," said Draco. "I want to know what he is reporting to you, and I want to be kept updated on the information."

"You'll have to join the Order than," said Dumbledore.

"Not happening," said Draco, finality in his voice.

"The Order is privy to the information Severus brings because they work to prevent attacks," said Dumbledore. "What will you be doing with the information?"

"Staying alive," said Draco. "I was out the other night and an attempt was made to take me to the Dark Lord."

Bill sat forward at that, alarm in his eyes, but Dumbledore didn't look surprised. Draco wondered if the old man had spies in Knockturn Alley, and then figured that it was more than probable.

"I heard of that," said Dumbledore, confirming his suspicions. "I also heard that you proved yourself to be very skilled and cunning, but also ruthless."

The blue eyes were not condoning or approving, rather they locked onto his own, with the knowledge of what he had done, and Draco felt the slightest bit guilty and he looked away, avoiding both Dumbledore's gaze and Bill's inquiring one.

"I think we can reach a compromise," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling once more. "I will let you talk to Severus, but your conversation will be monitored. There is some information that will not be revealed to you, is that acceptable?"

"It is," said Draco, figuring it was the best deal he would get, and it was a rather good one. "Where should he be dropped off?"

"My house," said Bill. "I'll take him to the Order immediately afterwards. 56 North Ridge. Do you need directions?"

"I can find a map," said Draco shrugging.

"Harry lives with his aunt and uncle," said Dumbledore. "Their address is-,"

"Privet Drive. Number 4," said Draco. "What time should I get him?"

"Late morning should be sufficient," said Dumbledore. "We don't want to disturb the neighbors. And you can give Harry this letter." Dumbledore pulled a piece of parchment out of his robes and handed it to Draco. "It explains to Harry why you are picking him up."

"Wait," said Draco. "He doesn't know that I'm coming to get him?"

"His mail is being monitored by the Death Eaters as well, so we can't really send him a message," said Bill, apologetically.

Draco slumped a bit in his chair. He could just imagine the scenario now. Potter, wand drawn and shouting curses at him, himself blocking them, the Death Eaters taking the opportunity to start a fire, forcing them all outside, and then killing them both. He frowned.

"It'll be fine," said Dumbledore. "Just give him the letter."

The Headmaster stood, obviously signaling the end of the meeting. Draco rose as well and walked them both to the door.

"Thanks for this," said Bill.

Draco sneered slightly, just to let Bill know that he wasn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart, and Bill only grinned in response. He waited until the two Order members had left and then went back to his keyboard. He still had time before he needed to play chauffer.

"What's this about someone trying to kidnap Draco and take him to Voldemort?" asked Bill, once he and the Headmaster were out of Draco's very nice flat. "Why didn't you tell me?"

"He took care of it," said Dumbledore. "He is more than capable of taking care of himself, and even if he hadn't, Kingsley was there, looking into a leak for the Ministry, and so he would have been able to step in if things had gone wrong."

"If it had been anyone else, you would have told their relatives," said Bill. "Draco doesn't have any, that would care at least, and I think that it's only fair that someone else know these things are happening so they can keep an eye open for him, or help him if he does get hurt."

"Are you suggesting that you wish to keep updated on him?" asked Dumbledore.

"Yes," said Bill.

"You're not his parent, Bill."

"Thank Merlin," said Bill, "but still, he's my friend, and he saved my life. I would like to know when something like this happens."

"He won't like anyone prying into his business," said Dumbledore.

"I know," said Bill, "But he expects it of me. So what exactly happened?"

"As far as Kingsley could tell, Draco was meeting an informant in one of the more dangerous areas of Knockturn Alley. The informant turned on him with plans to kidnap Draco and see how much his father would offer for his safe return. Draco managed to subdue five men, including the informant, and then proceeded to interrogate the informant for information on who had sent him. It was then discovered that the ransom was just a cover for their real operation, which was to take Draco to Tom."

"And he was ruthless because?" prodded Bill, wanting the whole story.

"He's not an innocent, Bill," said Dumbledore. "You do know that, right?"

He obviously did not want to spoil Bill's idea of a confused genius struggling to figure out what was right and wrong, however, Bill held no such delusions.

"I am quite aware of that, Headmaster."

"Very well," said Dumbledore. "By interrogating the informant, I mean torturing him. The man received an Acid Sherbet in the mouth while it was still acidic and then the Cruciatus curse."

"Oh," said Bill, not really appalled at what Draco had done. Dumbledore caught that.

"You don't seem surprised."

"I'm not really," said Bill. "Draco used the Imperius when he was helping me escape, and I definitely think that it was necessary. I'm not saying that I don't believe the Unforgivables are bad, it's just that I have a different view on them now. If Draco had wanted to, he could have done far worse to that man, and I wouldn't have held it against him if he had. Voldemort would have done worse to him."

"I see," said Dumbledore.

"You don't seem to upset about Draco using Unforgivables either," said Bill, noticing that the Headmaster seemed hardly disturbed at all.

"It is as you say," said Dumbledore. "Lucius has no doubt taught his son curses that are much worse than 'crucio' in that they are permanent. I have a feeling that Draco was also making a statement to the rest of those gathered in Knockturn Alley as well. As long as he does not make a habit of using Unforgivables, I think he will be fine. Of course, it is a little worrying that he can perform two of the three Unforgiveables, that we know of, at least. The spells take an extreme amount of power, and it just goes to show that we will need to keep a careful eye on him."

"You don't think he'll do anything wrong, do you?" asked Bill.

"Not intentionally, no," said Dumbledore. "But even the best of intentions can lead to grave mistakes, and I do not believe that Draco even means for the best, so we will watch, and step in if necessary, but I think that he will turn out alright. He has an excellent example in you Bill."

So, in the next chapter, coming out in two days, Draco rescues Harry from his relatives in a silver Cadillac convertible, and no, I do not own Cadillac, so consider yourselves properly disclaimed. Leave a review if you're excited!

The gleaming silver Cadillac convertible signaled then turned down the quiet street of Privet Drive. It was a sunny day out, and already at ten-thirty in the morning, it was hot, and as it was Saturday, most everyone was inside in the air conditioning watching television. However, as most snooty, small neighborhoods can attest to, the women in such residential areas can be extremely nosy, and the men love cars, so most of the street peeked through lacy white curtains as the fancy car pulled into the driveway of number four.

The car door opened and the occupant stepped out, shutting the door softly and then striding to the front porch where he rang the doorbell.

Vernon Dursley was one of the only people not watching the road; he was watching a particularly important news broadcast on a series of unexplained fires that had swept through England. While normally he would have attributed the fires to the maniacs that made up today's youth, the fact that the news caster was saying several robed figures were spotted at the last fire, he couldn't help but wonder if the fires were started by another source, a source that had ties to his detested nephew who was currently locked in the smallest bedroom upstairs.

Before he could contemplate that thought further, the doorbell was rung.

"Go away!" he shouted, because the screen door was up to catch a breeze since they did not have air conditioning. "We don't want anything!"

"Vernon, dearest," hissed Petunia in the hall, staring at the person at their door. "I don't think he's selling anything."

Vernon heaved his large frame off of the couch and walked to the door, instantly realizing that no, this person wouldn't be selling anything.

It was a young man and Vernon took in every detail. The fine leather shoes, the loose khaki pants, the thin, button-up linen shirt with light blue and grey pinstripes (the first two buttons undone), the navy suit jacket on top of that, the designer, blue-tinted sunglasses, and shocking white-blond hair. No this person wouldn't be a salesman, especially not with that convertible.

"Come in," said Vernon, opening the door so that the neighbors could see that he was on such good terms with an obviously rich young man.

"Thank you," said the young man, who, upon closer inspection, was still a teenager.

"Come into the kitchen," said Petunia. "We have some coffee made, would you like some?"

"Sure," said the teen, his pale lips twitching into a smile that more resembled a smirk.

"I'm Vernon Dursley," said Vernon, sticking his hand out.

"Draco," said the teen. "Draco Malfoy." Draco didn't seem to notice Vernon's outstretched hand, so Vernon hastily withdrew it, frowning slightly at the young man's odd name. He didn't mention it, of course. Draco Malfoy sat at the table and Petunia poured him a cup of coffee in their finest china.

"Thank you," said Draco Malfoy, accepting the cup but waving away any cream or sugar. Vernon added another point in the young man's favor, along with having money and good taste in cars; he drank coffee the man's way.

"So, what brings you here, Mr. Malfoy?" asked Vernon.

"Actually," said the teen, "I'm looking for a classmate of mine."

"Oh," said Petunia, "you must mean Dudders – I mean, Dudley. He's right in the living room."

Malfoy leaned forward to peer into the room and spotted the boy and the lips twitched into that smirky-smile again.

"No, not him," said Draco. "I'm looking for Harry Potter."

Dead silence.

Petunia and Vernon exchanged glances.

Malfoy sipped his coffee, shifted slightly, and pulled out a polished wooden stick from his back pocket and placed it on the table in front of him, casually, like a man would pull his keys from his pocket. The Dursleys stared.

"So you're…one of them," said Vernon, with barely disguised disgust and fear in his voice.

"I should think so," said Draco Malfoy, with a faint, condescending laugh. "I'm a Pureblood. Wizarding has been in my family since before Merlin came about. My father is Monseigneur Lucius Malfoy. I am his only son."

It was said in such a tone that the Dursleys knew they should be both reverent and fearful at the same time They were.

"I'll go get Harry," said Petunia, quickly excusing herself and practically fleeing from the room. Draco tilted the chair back, the wand still in front of him, a self-satisfied smile on the pale lips.

Upstairs the sound of several locks being turned drifted alarmingly well down to the kitchen and Draco frowned, finally reaching up to pull the sunglasses off his face. His cold, steely grey eyes turned on Vernon in a disgusted glare that was not at all lessened by the fact that he was balancing the chair precariously on two legs.

"Wash your face and come down. There's someone here to see you."

That was Petunia's voice and then she descended the stairs, coming back into the kitchen and shrinking under the grey gaze that was turned in her direction. She sat demurely, if not a little frightened, by her husband.

The sound of footsteps running down the stairs was the first indication of Harry, and a second later, the black-haired, green-eyed youth came into the kitchen, pulling up short at the sight of Draco Malfoy lounging at his kitchen table while his Aunt and Uncle kept eyeing the wand in front of him.

Draco set the chair back down on four legs and smirked up at the boy.

"'Lo, Potter," he drawled.

Draco knew he shouldn't antagonize the boy-hero, but he couldn't resisted the smirk and the ''Lo, Potter' in his slow, infuriating drawl. Harry glared.

"The hell are you doing here, Malfoy?" he asked, and then his hand clenched, and Draco realized that Potter didn't have his wand. His gaze narrowed, wondering if the boy really was as stupid as to forget his wand in his room.

"I'm here to pick you up," he said casually.

"That's a load of bull," said Harry. "What are you really here for? Trying to send Death Eaters here to kill the rest of my family?"

The two horrors that were Harry's Aunt and Uncle stiffened slightly in alarm, but wisely held their tongues.

"Well, then the Death Eaters would be here already, wouldn't they?" asked Draco. "I'd hardly stop for a cup of coffee and a pleasant chat." He reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out the letter Dumbledore had given him. "Here."

Harry stepped back slightly. "What are you trying to pull, Malfoy?" he asked suspiciously.

"Nothing," said Draco. "It's just a letter, so take it and read it so we can leave. I'd like to get out of here before I grow old."

Harry still hesitated, and while it annoyed Draco, he knew it was smart not to grab anything your arch-nemesis offered you.

"I saved your life, Potter," he said, staring seriously at the green-eyed boy. "When you fell off your broom last year in the Quidditch game, I caught you. You know that, you know it wasn't just some fluke."

"You said I fell into you," retorted Harry.

"It's not like I wanted everyone to know that I saved your life. No offense, Potter, but it's not really high on the list of priorities for Slytherins. Take the letter. I swear on the grave of Merlin it's not a Portkey or hexed or anything else bad."

Harry stared back at him, seeming to read the truth in his eyes because the boy took the letter and opened it. Draco hadn't been able to read the letter, as it was spelled only for Harry, and since it was Dumbledore who had done the spell, Draco hadn't tried to break it.

He took the opportunity to study the other boy as he read. He could see by the way that the clothes swam on him that they must have been hand-me-downs from the huge, fat boy in the other room. The bagginess of the material made it impossible for Draco to gauge how skinny the boy was, but his cheeks were rather sunken in and his hands were bony. He was also pale, and while he was still much tanner than Draco's almost white skin, he could tell that the boy had probably been locked in his room for most of the summer.

Harry looked up to see Draco studying him, but he didn't mention it.

"I'll go pack," he said.

Draco was more than mildly surprised. Even with the letter from Dumbledore, and even though he had revealed that he had saved Harry's life, he had still expected more Death Eater cracks and a slew of questions. However, before he got to quiz Potter on his unexpected obedience, the boy turned to his uncle.

"Uncle Vernon, I'm leaving. Could I please get my stuff?"

Harry's uncle looked elated. "It's about time they came and got you," he muttered, pulling a key from his pocket and walking over to the cupboard under the stairs. Draco knew that, once upon a time, Harry had been locked in the small space, and he wondered just what sort of things they kept there now, so he pocketed his wand and followed the family.

Vernon turned the key and pulled the door open. It was a small, cramped area and Draco felt a surge of hatred towards the Dursleys for locking anyone in there. Yes, Narcissa had, on occasion, locked him in his room, but he had a whole suite to himself. He wondered if Harry suffered from claustrophobia, or if practically living in a box made him immune. It was an interesting psychological question.

Vernon pulled out the trunk and shoved it down the hall, then he pulled out Harry's Firebolt. "That all, boy?" he asked rather harshly.

Draco raised an eyebrow at the tone, and watched as Harry turned red, no doubt from the shame of having his school rival know about his less-than-perfect home life.

"My wand," he said quietly.

Draco would have been amused at how Vernon and Petunia flinched at the word 'wand', much how witches and wizards flinched at the name of Voldemort, but that was overshadowed by the inexplicable anger Draco felt at the fact that they had locked away Harry's wand.

In wizarding families, taking away a wand, even as a punishment, was worse than child abuse. To leave anyone without a means to do magic is unthinkable, and besides, this was Harry Potter. Didn't they know that Death Eaters could have attacked? Didn't they know that without his wand a wizard is as good as much as dead? Didn't they know that if Potter died, their race would be wiped out?

He was so outraged that he opened his mouth to tell off Potter's uncle, but he caught himself just in time and merely waited until Harry had gone back upstairs before turning on the Muggles.

He pulled out his wand and tapped the cupboard door, muttering a string of Latin.

"What did you do?" demanded Vernon, stepping forward angrily, but then shrinking back once Draco turned his coldest glare on him.

"I cursed you," said Draco. "You will never again be able to lock things inside of this cupboard. If you do, your house, and all of your worldly possessions will burn. If I were you, I would lock that cupboard back up, and throw away the key."

Vernon gaped at him and then he and his wife retreated back into the living room. A few minutes later and Harry came down, his trunk thunking down the stairs behind him, holding his owl in its cage as well as his broom.

Draco wordlessly waved his wand and shrunk the broom while it was still in Potter's hand.

"Hey!" yelped Harry, startled at the sudden change in size.

"I don't have room for all of your junk in my car," said Draco as the Firebolt was reduced to the size of a quill. He shrunk the trunk next to the size of a large shoe box. "Let's go," he said, not offering to help Potter carry the things, and not even holding the door for him. He went straight to his car and climbed in.

Harry followed, stopping on the front porch and staring at the convertible.

"That's yours?" he asked.

"Yes," said Draco.

"Can you even drive?" asked Harry. He put his things in the back and shut the door, stepping back to study the vehicle carefully then turning to Draco again. "Do you even have your license?"

"Merlin, Potter," said Draco. "Get in already."

"Not until I know why you are picking me up," said Harry.

Finally, Draco thought, here come the questions.

"Didn't Dumbledore explain in the letter?" he returned.

"He said to go with you," said Harry. "Nothing more. So why are you picking me up?"

"Because Death Eaters are going to be attacking your house later tonight," said Draco, shrugging slightly as if it happened all of the time. To his surprise, Harry ran back in the house.

"Uncle Vernon!" Draco could hear through the screen. "You might want to leave the house. The bad wiz-people might be coming tonight, so you should leave."

There was an explosion of noise, mainly from Harry's uncle bellowing oaths and a shriek from the aunt. He could see a flurry of motion in the house and then Harry came out again, a subdued expression on his face. He got into the car and buckled his seat belt.

"You really are a Gryffindor, aren't you?" asked Draco. "I would have left them for the Death Eaters." He started the engine, cutting off any remark Harry might have made, then backed out of the driveway and started down the road. He glanced over when Harry pulled off his large sweater, to reveal an equally large t-shirt, but Draco still got a good look at a very skinny body.

Draco turned on the main road and Harry spoke up again.

"Why are you picking me up?"

"You just asked," said Draco.

"No," said Harry. "Why are you picking me up?"

Draco sneered slightly. "Concerned that I might have faked the letter and am taking you to the Dark Lord?"

"You won't," said Harry. His voice was convinced, as if he truly believed that.

Draco shot him a look and then returned to watching the road.

"You had better hope your assumption is correct, Potter, else the Dark Lord might finally succeed where he failed sixteen years ago."

"He failed with you," said Harry.

Draco glanced over. "What are you talking about Potter?" he demanded. "What did the letter say?" If Dumbledore had dared to tell Potter about him refusing the Dark Lord, he would personally turn the entire Order in to the racist madman.

"It gave the address of the Order, so I would now it was him, and then it said to go with you. Nothing more."

"Then what the hell are you talking about?"

Harry paused. "It's…rather ironic, really. The boy they want to kill Voldemort, the one that they want to be the complete opposite to him, actually has a strong…bond with him."

"Bond?" asked Draco. He could see Harry reach up to rub his scar out of the corner of his eye.

"Something like it," said Harry. "I can feel it when he's angry or happy, or feeling a strong emotion. Sometimes, I get visions."

"I'm assuming not prophetic ones," said Draco.

"No, things that are happening right then, but through Voldemort's eyes."

Draco had a sudden sinking feeling as he could pretty much guess what had happened, but he remained quiet, even as he felt Harry's eyes turn on him.

"So," said Harry, "the night after school let out I saw a bunch of initiates. It was sick, you know, the way they actually wanted to join, even though he was crucioing them, how he liked to crucio them."

Draco stiffened, his hands tightening on the steering wheel.

"I saw you there," said Harry. "He saved you for last on purpose. He liked your answers by the way, but I thought it was unfair that he still cursed you even though you got them all right, crucioing you for being perfect.

"'Crucioing' isn't a word," said Draco, wanting the subject changed.

"Four times was it?" asked Harry.

Draco couldn't help but flinch. "Something like it," he said.

"Anyway, as much as I hated you right then, I felt bad for you, but then you turned him down, even though he wanted you to be his heir. Feel like explaining that one?"

"Not exactly," said Draco.

"But I told you my story," said Harry.

"We never had a deal."

"Something must have happened. Was it a sudden epiphany?"

"I didn't know you could use such big words," said Draco, rather snidely.

"Don't be a bastard, Malfoy," said Harry. "I'm trying to be nice here."

"So trying to be nice includes calling me a bastard?"

"You know, if you weren't so much of a prat, you wouldn't be half bad."

"I appreciate the vote of confidence," said Draco. He pulled into the parking lot of a fast food restaurant and then stopped at the drive-through.

"Hello," crackled the voice over the speaker, and then there was a bit of static ending with "-order, please?"

"A cheeseburger meal with onion rings and a medium vanilla milkshake," said Draco.

"Is that all?" asked the voice.

"And a medium chocolate milk shake," said Draco.

There was more static, which Draco supposed was the amount due, but he could add numbers together easily and add on tax. He was, after all, a genius. He pulled up to the window and gave the cashier exact change and received the bag of food.

"Here," said Draco, giving the bag to Harry. "Eat."

"What?" asked Harry.

"You're skinnier than a thestral, Potter. What do they do, starve you?"

Harry flushed red and Draco pulled back out onto the main road and held out his hand.

"The chocolate milkshake is mine," he said.

Harry handed him the plastic cup and Draco had to really suck on the straw for the ice cream to get through, but it was surprisingly good for a fast food chain.

"So," said Draco, "they lock you up and starve you, and then lock your things away. I'm assuming that they don't really like magic?"

"You're a regular genius, Malfoy," said Harry, around a bite of cheeseburger.

"Don't get anything on the leather, alright?" asked Draco.

"Sure," said Harry. He ate the rest of the meal in silence, and rather quickly as well.

"So, where are we going?" asked Harry, once he was finished with his lunch.

"Bill's house," said Draco.

"Bill? Bill Weasley?"

"Yeah," said Draco. He was about to say more, but then Harry reached up and rubbed his forehead.

"What's wrong?" asked Draco.

"You know that bond thing?" asked Harry.

"What about it?" asked Draco.

"Well, I can sort of tell when he's feeling a strong emotion, and now he's pretty much furious."

"He must have figured out that you left," said Draco.

"I think he figured out a while ago actually," said Harry. "It's been steadily growing."

"And you decide to tell me this now?" asked Draco.

"It's not like we can actually do something about it," said Harry.

Draco figured he had a point so he didn't say anything, though they were both on edge. Draco was just beginning to think that maybe nothing was going to happen, when he glanced out the review mirror and his stomach clenched. There were three robed figures with white masks riding on brooms and they were quickly catching up with them.

"Shit!"

"What?"

"Potter, get down!"

Draco didn't wait for Harry to comply; he reached over and shoved the black-haired boy down, just as a spell ricocheted off the smooth metal of the trunk, whizzing inches away from where Harry's head had been.

Draco was immensely grateful that the road they were on right then was wide and with almost no traffic. He stomped on the brake, yanking the wheel hard to the right, swinging the car around with a squeal of tire on pavement to face the mounted Death Eaters. His wand was in his hand in the next instant and then he was flooring the accelerator.

"Flabrorum!" he shouted. It was a spell uniquely suited for these sorts of encounters as it caused a shockwave of wind to emit from his wand. It flipped one Death Eaters off his broom, the man falling twenty feet and staying down, and caused another to veer left, out of control. He kept his foot on the gas, putting the Death Eaters behind him, but the third was undaunted. He could see the rider in his review mirror, casting curses at the car.

One hit and the windshield shattered. Draco threw up a hand to protect his face from the onslaught of glass, and he felt a sharp bite of pain in his forearm. Potter had simply dropped to the floor, and now he was sitting up, twisted backwards in his seat as he began returning fire.

"Hold on!" Draco yelled to Harry as he glimpsed the road ahead. It was an intersection and there were cars crossing the perpendicular road. There was no way Draco could make it across the bisecting street and so he merely jerked the wheel right when they came to the traffic light. The car slid slightly, as it wasn't meant for such abuse, but he managed to hold the road, turning onto the other road, speeding ahead. He could hear a series of crashes and frenzied shouting behind them, but he didn't look back. He knew what had happened: Muggles had just got their first look at a flying broomstick.

He accelerated further, passing the two cars ahead of him by driving on the shoulder, and then pulling back on the road.

"He still behind us Potter?" he asked, swerving into the opposite lane to pass another car. They were going to be getting on a highway soon, at least, that was where this road led, and a highway meant more cars which meant more difficulty getting away. The broom was more agile than they were, and the Death Eater could merely blast cars out of his way, and while Draco could do the same, he didn't feel that it was exactly morally right.

"He's dropped back a bit," said Harry, crouched in front of his seat, his wand at the ready.

Draco slowed a bit, glancing in the review mirror and trying to remember the map he had studied before going to pick Potter up. If he was right, and he was always right, then he could turn… right… here!

He wrenched the wheel right, cutting off a car that honked loudly at him, and sending Harry to the ground, his head smacking the side of the door. He didn't bother to apologize, barreling down a narrow road that was surrounded by trees. The Death Eater took advantage of the lack of Muggles and sped up, slowly gaining on them because Draco wasn't going quite as fast as he could.

"Uh, Malfoy?" asked Potter, his voice strained. "You might want to go a little faster."

There was a hill up ahead and Draco obligingly gunned the convertible so that when they finally crested the top, they were actually airborne for a split second. The next instant and they were under a long railroad bridge that was actually more of a tunnel and Draco jammed the brake.

He supposed his should have warned Harry this time at least, as the back of the boy-hero's head smashed into the dashboard. He quickly doused the engines, leaving them in the black of the tunnel.

"What are-?"

"Shh," hissed Draco, cutting Harry off. He pulled off his seat belt and turned around, crouching low as he could see the Death Eater flying around the entrance of the tunnel, before leaving and flying up high to see if they came out the other end. When no one appeared at the end, the Death Eater slowly flew into the tunnel.

Draco had been considering what curse to use, and he was just about to direct the man's broom into wall quite forcefully when Potter called out a curse of his own.

"Stupefy!"

He had good aim, Draco had to admit as the red light hit the man in the chest and he dropped, but it was a weak curse.

"You might want to look into a more lethal curse next time," said Draco, turning to his classmate and just making out his features. "You know, take him out of the equation, rob the Dark Lord of another follower."

Harry turned to look at him as well and Draco figured that he was much easier to make out in the dark. His skin practically glowed.

"Is that what you would have done?" he asked. "Killed him?"

"Not killed him, per se," said Draco. "Just make him unable to function, but that would just be a little too Slytherin for a bloody Gryffindor, wouldn't it?"

He could see Harry shrug. "The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin," he said casually.

Draco rarely felt surprise, even mild surprise. His ability at reading people was unparalleled, except maybe in comparison to his father and Dumbledore, and because his perceptiveness was paired with genius, he had most people categorized and figured out. So, no, Draco had almost never received a real, honest-to-goodness shock before. Except for now.

He blinked at Harry, too startled to do anything else.

"You," he said. "In Slytherin."

"I suppose I could tell you the story," said Harry, "but you'd have to tell me about not taking Voldemort up on his offer first."

Now that was Slytherin right there, and Draco quirked an eyebrow.

"Very well," he said. After all, Potter already knew he denied the Dark Lord, and no doubt he would talk to Dumbledore when he reached Headquarters, so in reality he would just be telling Harry what he would find out in a little while. "I attended a few Death Eater meetings last summer and saw that the Dark Lord was just a power-crazed madman. I realized that I would rather be the one holding the power than the one bowing, so that was the first point against being a Death Eater. The second is, of course, if blood purity is all that, why the hell is a half-blood leading the purebloods. And the third is I really don't like the constraining membership rules. I can better look after myself if I don't limit my loyalties. Your turn."

Harry was silent for a moment. "Those reasons are very…Slytherin," he said finally.

"Don't tell me you were hoping I changed out of the goodness of my heart, Potter," he said, his sneer coming back into his voice.

Harry laughed. "Even I know that's not possible."

"Good," said Draco. "Now spill. Why were you almost in Slytherin?"

"When I first put the hat on, it said I would do well in Slytherin, that I had a strong desire to prove myself and that it would help me achieve my goals, but you were sorted into Slytherin and Ron said that only bad wizards went there, so I asked it to put me anywhere besides that."

Draco laughed lightly, albeit without any real humor. "The-Boy-Who-Should-Be-Dead-By-Now in Slytherin," he mused. "I never would have guessed. Although, I think it's right about Slytherin helping you achieve your goals. Your problem is you're too Gryffindor."

"Looking out for others instead of myself first?" asked Harry.

"That," said Draco, "but also the fact that you could afford to be a bit more underhanded with your tactics. And you should use every available means necessary, like the Ministry. You could throw your weight around and start an army, or read a list of names of the people you know are Death Eaters and tell people to shun them. Slytherin would have helped you there."

"So you think I should be in Slytherin?" asked Harry.

"Hell no," said Draco. "You have to keep up with appearances. Since this is a battle of good versus evil, you kind of have to be the epitome of fair play and honor and all that other crap that will get you killed."

Harry just laughed and didn't take offense, which Draco supposed was rather nice. He got back in his seat and Harry did as well. He turned the car on, the headlights coming on in the dark only to light on black robes and a white mask on a broom. It was the Death Eater that hadn't been felled by Draco's wind curse and he had snuck up on them while they were talking.

"Merde!"

He jammed the car in drive and smashed down the gas, throwing them forward and smacking into the Death Eater. The man crumpled on the hood of the car, sliding up against the remains of the windshield as Draco continued to accelerate. Once they cleared the tunnel, Draco slammed on the brakes, sending the man flying into the air and then landing hard on the side of the road.

Draco and Harry turned to each other, both of them breathing heavily.

"You alright, Potter?" Draco asked, noticing that the black-haired boy had a large bruise forming on his cheek and that he was holding the back of his head. Harry pulled his hand down and Draco glimpsed a small amount of blood, but otherwise the golden boy looked fine.

"I'm good," said Harry. "You?"

Well, now that he thought of it, there was a shooting pain in his right forearm and upon closer inspection there was a sizeable piece of glass sticking through his jacket sleeve and he didn't know how deep it went, but it was hardly life threatening.

"I'm good," he echoed. "Let's get the hell out of here."

"Agreed," said Harry.

Draco only paused long enough to fix the windshield, and once the glass was fully restored he wasted no time in driving away from their attackers and getting back towards the route to Bill's house.

The last twenty minutes of the trip were, thankfully, uneventful. Their destination was a modestly-sized house with a cheerful front garden and decent lawn area. The other houses on the street were equally friendly, and Draco could see Bill and Fleur being quite happy there. And speaking of the red-haired man, no sooner had Draco pulled into the driveway than the man was at the door.

Draco shut off the engine and the two climbed out. Draco was sure that he felt as relieved as Harry looked, but he maintained his calm façade.

"How was the drive?" asked Bill, coming forward to help unload Harry's things, but then he pulled up at the sight of Harry's face. "The hell happened?"

"Death Eaters," said Draco shortly.

Bill immediately looked concerned, hurrying to grab the trunk-box and ushering the boys inside.

"You can put the things here for now," he told Harry, setting the trunk on the kitchen table. Harry opted to put his owl's cage on the floor, which was much more sanitary.

"Headmaster," Bill called, "they're here."

Harry gladly sank into the chair at the table as Dumbledore and Kingsley came in. Harry was a little surprised to see them, but then he figured that they were here to make sure that the Death Eaters didn't attack, although their presence would have been more helpful on the road.

"What happened?" asked Dumbledore, taking in the bruising on the side of his face where he had smacked it against the door during one of Malfoy's sharp turns.

"Death Eaters," said Harry, letting the Headmaster examine the bruise and then the back of his head.

"We'll get some cream on that once we get to Headquarters," said Dumbledore.

Bill passed over a bag of ice and Harry put it on the back of his head, reveling in the cold that dimmed the throbbing headache he was developing.

"They attacked you?" asked Kingsley. "In full daylight?"

"Is that what you call it when it's all bright outside?" asked Malfoy sarcastically from where he was sitting across the table.

"Draco, be nice," said Bill.

Harry watched as Malfoy smirked at the reprimand but didn't say anything, which was odd. The blond then proceeded to take off his jacket, though he seemed to have some trouble with the right sleeve. Once it was off, Harry realized why.

There was a piece of glass stuck through Malfoy's linen shirt that was slightly stained with blood, though the glass seemed to be holding the rest of the blood back.

"That's sick, Malfoy," he said, unable to think of what else to say, and everyone immediately looked over to see what was wrong.

The grey eyes flickered to his face for a moment, glaring slightly for the attention he gained, before going back to his arm as he carefully pried the shirt up and rolled the sleeve away from the glass. It was even more disgusting seeing the glass stuck in pale white skin.

"Shit, Draco," said Bill. "You alright?"

"I'm fine," said Draco, getting up and walking over to the sink. He jerked the glass shard out of his arm and Harry nearly gagged, but then frowned again as Bill went over to Malfoy's side and helped him wrap a towel around the cut, while Draco muttered something about 'Gryffindorish worry tendencies'.

He realized what was strange then: Bill and Malfoy acted as if they were friends. It was apparent in the way Bill used 'Draco' when addressing the teen as opposed to 'Malfoy' like the rest of the world. He also teased him and scolded him, as if he was another Weasley brother. Malfoy, for his part, seemed to be slightly more at ease because he wouldn't stare so coldly and he also seemed to steer away from the nastier comments when Bill was around.

He wondered what had happened, and then turned back to Dumbledore and Kingsley who were conversing.

"Ministry is going to have a field day with this one," Kingsley was saying. "The Obliviators are going to have to work double-time, and once they find out who was in the car the papers will have a heyday."

"They won't."

That was Malfoy, and Kingsley and Dumbledore looked up as Draco sat back down, holding the kitchen towel to his arm, a slight red stain spreading across the terry-cloth.

"There's a disillusionment on the car," drawled Malfoy. "All of the attention is directed to the car, and not the occupants, as long as they are physically in the car. The Death Eaters knew we were in the car so they could see through the charm, but the reporters will merely think it's a new Death Eater sport, chasing Muggles in cars."

Kingsley frowned at the flippant way Malfoy said it, Dumbledore's eyes merely twinkled, and Bill didn't seem the least bit bothered by the sick description.

"I assume you were able to disarm the Death Eaters then?" asked Dumbledore.

Malfoy gave a 'well that's obvious' look but nodded.

"Hit one with my car, Potter stupefied one, and the other was knocked off his broom by Flagrorum."

"Ah," said Dumbledore, looking delighted. "I knew that spell would come in handy. How did you learn it?"

"Was looking up good ways to win a Quidditch match," said Draco. "Fifth year, Slytherin and Ravenclaw. I thought it was somewhat poetic that you invented it."

Dumbledore had invented it? And Malfoy was admitting to Dumbledore that he had used it to cheat at a Quidditch game?

Harry studied Malfoy, as the blond raised his eyebrow, as if challenging the Headmaster to say anything, as if daring him to punish him.

"Such actions will be punished in the future," said Dumbledore, but he did not look particularly troubled, nor did he look all of that angry. "Especially with your new position."

"Just making sure you know what you're getting yourself into," said Draco. "And I'll only be punished if I get caught."

Harry frowned, completely at a loss to what was going on, but before he could thin on it further, the front door opened and Fleur Weasley entered, looking positively radiant, though she seemed surprised to see them all gathered there.

"Bill," she asked, a warning note in her voice. "What is this?"

Bill looked a little guilty. "Fleur," he said, "you weren't supposed to be back so soon."

"Is this why you sent me out?" asked Fleur, her hands going to her hips and tossing her hair behind her shoulder. "So you could have a secret meeting?" The last bit came out "'ave a zeecret meeting" as her accent intensified from non-existent to full blown as she got angry.

"Well, yes," said Bill, turning a shade of red that rivaled Ron at his most embarrassed. "I just didn't want you to get hurt if something should happen!"

Harry got the gist of the argument. Bill had tricked Fleur out of the house so she could be safe if something bad was to happen, and Fleur wasn't too pleased.

"We are in this together!" she was saying, her accent making the words almost unintelligible. "You promised me no secrets!"

"I worry about you and the baby!" said Bill, trying to make her understand, but then his wife launched into a tirade of French. Harry was pretty sure that Bill didn't understand all of what his wife was saying, but it was clear from the sheepish look that he understood enough to understand.

Dumbledore's eyes were twinkling at the couple, because even when they fought it was obvious that they were still hopelessly in love, and Kingsley was poker-faced, but Malfoy seemed to be listening in to the conversation. More than listening though, he seemed to be understanding because after a particularly foul sounding statement from Fleur that made Bill cringe, his lips quirked upwards ever-so-slightly.

But then Bill responded in French as well, and then took Fleur in his arms and their tones changed drastically, from angry and placating, to forgiving and adoring. Harry was quite certain that he did not want to know what they were saying, because they seemed to start a game of sorts, who could make the other blush more. Bill said something low and in a rather sensuous tone, which made Fleur flush. Fleur responded in a sexy voice, which made Bill turn red, but then he said something decidedly dirty, because Fleur went scarlet.

Malfoy, who was looking rather repulsed once the conversation turned gooey, now jerked up in alarm.

"Juste pour vous prévenir," he said loudly, to get their attention. "je comprends tout ce que vous vous racontez..."

"Oh," said Bill, going bright red. "I forgot. Sorry."

Malfoy only shook his head, but Fleur spoke up.

"You have an Eastern French accent," she said. "Are you from France?"

"Draco was born in France," said Bill. "In Paris, actually."

"Ahh," said Fleur. "Enchantée de faire votre connaissance"

"Moi de meme, Madame," said Draco, inclining his head.

Harry was surprised; he had no clue that his school rival was foreign. He wondered if anyone else knew.

"Well then," said Dumbledore. "I must get Harry to Headquarters. Kingsley, would you help Harry with his things? And, Draco, if you-,"

"No," said Malfoy, quite firmly.

Dumbledore merely chuckled. "Very well then," he said. "Good day to you all."

And then the Floo started up.

"Potter," said Malfoy, just as Harry was getting ready to step into the flames. "You tell no one about the events of this afternoon or I will permanently seal your lips together." He looked completely serious.

"That curse is illegal," said Kingsley, not exactly challenging him, but putting out an unthreatening warning.

Malfoy shrugged, smirking slightly. "I have an unregistered wand," he said.

"Draco," said Bill, a parental note in his voice. "Play nice."

Malfoy didn't look sheepish, or even apologetic, but he did stop his comments, turning to Bill with his eyebrow raised. Bill shook his head in helplessness, but then sat in the chair next to Draco with a clean cloth and bandage, trying to see to Draco's arm. Malfoy was being most uncooperative, trying to brush the former-professor off.

Harry turned back to the Floo, eager to get to a place where he wouldn't be so confused. The last thing he heard was Malfoy muttering something about Gryffindors and worry habits.

Woot! In the next chapter, Draco goes to a code-breaker meeting and discovers that he has a niece. Please review.

The Translations are as follows.

I am quite aware of what you are saying. Just so you know.

I am pleased to meet you.

Likewsie.

Of course, that's what they're supposed to be, but because I don't speak French, and some of my reviewers do, you'd have to ask them for the literal translations. Review!





5. The Code Breaker Meeting

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter; hence, I am not making any money off of this. Which is actually too bad, because I could really use some cash right now.

AUTHOR'S NOTE: My apologies for putting this up early Tuesday morning as opposed to Monday like I promiesd, but that just goes to show that nothing is certain in life. I really was going to put it up, but the network wouldn't let me because it was too busy or something, so right after my overnight shift, I came back and posted it. Just for you guys. I didn't even take a shower to get all the nasty junk off of me. Now I will though. Bye! Oh, yeah, read and review, because I showed really dedication to you, lol.

Lilith: I'm sorry I'm making you wait so long, but it's hard to find the time to write while pulling a job and what not, otherwise, I would gladly update three times a week. But, thanks for reviewing, I love getting your reviews because they're so enthusiastic and make me happy. Like this :-D.

Meirta: Glad that you liked the twist with other POV's after Draco's, because as this story is about Draco learning to make friends, I'm going to be writing several peoples POV's, not just Bill's. Thanks for reviewing.

Spyrit: Yah, I almost felt bad putting the car through all that, especially because I like Caddy's, but don't worry, the car will be fine. Thanks for the review!

Carla: Definitely right about the Hermione being Head Girl, and you nailed the Draco spending more time with the Golden Trio right on the head. Go you. Thanks for reviewing.

. : Glad you liked that part, I like writing those sarcastic bits, prolly cause I like being sarcastic. Thanks for reviewing.

Gremlin: I'm glad that you liked the last chapter, it was definitely a fun one to write. As always, it's great to hear from you.

R2D2: 'Made your day'? Aww, thanks!

Mask: I sneer at your face. HA!

Guest: I'm glad that you like my Harry, and I definitely know what you mean about Harry being obnoxious in some stories, hence I have tried very hard to write him in a not so angsty, infuriating way. I'm also glad you liked the car chase. I figured it was something you didn't see everyday in HP fanfic. Thanks for the review!

Jill: Glad you like the French, I just think men speaking other languages is rather sexy. Thanks for the review.

Faith Maguire: Hey, thanks! If there's one thing I try to do, it's keep the characters in character, so I'm glad I'm doing a passable job. Thanks for reviewing!

Dbi626: What happens now indeed? Well, Harry will be more accepting of Draco, but since he's a Gryffindor, he's keeping Draco's secret safe. But still, the future interactions will be fun to see.

Slickslytherin: Good luck on your story. Let me know what it's called and I'll check it out.

Bena24: Lol, short and to the point. Like it.

E-san: I will never leave a story half finished, unless of course unforeseeable incidences occur. Sorry to keep you on edge like that, and I will be following a better updating schedule from now on. Thanks for the review.

Astaroth: Thanks!

Draco received the owl about his position as Head Boy on Monday morning. Accompanying the usual Hogwarts information was another letter, one that was carefully spelled to open up only to him. He quickly scanned the contents and then smirked as he realized the letter was written in code, a simple code, so that everyone would be able to figure it out, but a code none-the-less.

Ignoring his breakfast, he pulled out a notebook, flipped to a clean page, and began writing out the translation. The message only said that the meeting for the code breakers was to be on Tuesday at seven in the evening at Hogwarts. He supposed the location made sense. The Dark Lord had never been able to set foot in Hogwarts, at least, not since he became the Dark Lord.

Draco put the letter down, wondering who the other code breakers were. He already knew the Head Girl would be Granger and he made a slight face. She was going to be unbearable.

Draco spent the day fixing his car from its encounter with the Death Eaters. It was nothing bad, a few dents here and there, but he liked his car and so he made sure that everything was in perfect condition. He then took it through the car wash.

Tuesday came with a rain storm in the morning. Draco finished translating the fifth Persian runes while listening to the sound of thunder and rain. It was a long storm, and once it had past, it left the temperature much lower than it had been the day before. The weather seemed more appropriate for early fall than summer but Draco didn't really mind; he was fond of the cooler weather.

He had planned on going to Hogwarts a little early, if not on time, but at twenty of seven, Bill Flooed into his living room. Draco had been playing the keyboard and he raised his eyebrow at the red-haired man.

"Need anything?" he asked.

"I thought we'd head over together," said Bill.

"You're going?" asked Draco. "I thought it was just a code breaker thing."

"It is," said Bill, "but I'm teaching the lesson along with some snooty guy. Alberich Centworthy. He thinks he's Merlin's gift to the wizarding world. You'll hate him."

"Centworthy," said Draco. "He did the Gaelic runes, didn't he?"

"That's the one," said Bill. "So, are you coming?"

Draco narrowed his eyes at Bill. "You didn't just come over to walk me there, did you?" he asked.

"Weeellll, not really," said Bill. "Kingsley and I have a bet going. He thinks that you're going to be completely out of your league at the meeting, because there are a bunch of smart people there, and I said that you were going to be out of their league because you were so much smarter."

"How much did you put on me?" asked Draco.

"Ten galleons," said Bill. "So, don't hold back, alright?"

Draco smirked. "I won't," he said.

He walked over to his closet and pulled out his jacket, then noticed Bill staring at it.

"That's not yours, is it?" Bill asked.

Draco pulled it on. "I got it from this guy named Mark. I met him when I left and stayed with him for a couple of days, helping him fix cars. This was his when he was younger, and he gave it to me because he said I dressed too nicely for a car mechanic."

The jacket was an olive green khaki material with zippered pockets and brass buttons that lent it a faint military look. That image was destroyed by the patches sewn on the sleeves and hem that boasted of various rock and punk bands. The material was torn in a few places, and it appeared to be permanently wrinkled, but it fit Draco perfectly, and it was comfortable. Besides, he knew that all of his old acquaintances and family would pitch a fit if they saw it, so he wore it along with an evil smirk on his face.

"Just when I thought I had you figured out," said Bill, shaking his head.

Draco pocketed his wand, the registered one, since he would be in the company of Aurors and Ministry officials and then he and Bill Apparated to Hogsmeade and walked up to Hogwarts together.

They arrived a few minutes late, because they took their time walking to the school, but Bill was helping teach, so it wasn't as if they could start without him.

They reached the room on the second floor and entered. A hush fell over the room and everyone turned to stare at them, or more specifically, Draco. He stared right back.

The room was large with Kingsley and another man, who was presumable Centworthy, at the front. Eight desks were set in four rows, and by each desk was a chalkboard set on a wheeled stand. Six code breakers were already gathered and Draco only knew one of them. Hermione Granger was sitting in the third row and her expression mirrored everyone else's: confusion, surprise, and a little bit of fear.

"Sorry I'm late," said Bill, striding forward, taking the attention off of Draco, who took the opportunity to slide into the last row desk, the one that wasn't behind Granger, sprawling slightly in the seat.

"Thank you all for coming," said Bill. "Although this operation will rely mainly on your individual efforts, right now I want us all to get to know each other. Information is the key, and I want all of you to be informed on what is going on. Let's go around the room then and tell everyone our names, and then the contact you are paired with. We'll start in the front and go around to the back. After you introduce yourself, you will be given a paper to sign, and you will swear secrecy. The paper that you are signing makes it impossible to tell anyone of this operation who is not already involved without suffering the consequences, which is an immediate sleeping spell, which will then give the Aurors time to get to you before you reveal anything else. The appropriate punishment will then be administered."

The room, which had been silent before, now went deathly still, as everyone fully realized what it was they were getting into.

"If you do not wish to continue, you can leave now," said Bill. "You will, of course, be obliviated."

For as much as everyone looked terrified, no one moved, and the introductions began. Draco paid close attention as "Harriet Lester" began because any bit of information might come into handy.

The code breakers were an odd assortment of people, from the completely unknown, like house wife Harriet Lester to Lorenzo Holiday, a man with thinning grey hair who thought the world of himself. Of course, the fact that he was the writer of six different books on Ancient Runes and was the translator responsible for the Turkish Runes, gave him a lot of fame, fortune, and glory. Draco didn't know who he disliked more, Lorenzo or Alberich, the other teacher who strutted across the floor, giving a paper to each person as they introduced themselves.

Granger went second to last and she was paired with Riley Martin. Draco knew the name. She was an Auror who was half German, and Draco could safely assume that Martin would be in her mother's home country spying on Death Eaters there.

He noticed that when it came his turn to introduce himself, after Granger signed the paper, everyone turned to look at him curiously. So he gave his best Malfoy smirk and drawled out, "Draco Malfoy, I'm paired with Bill."

He said nothing more, which he knew was infuriating.

"Do you, Draco Malfoy, swear to keep this safe and secret until the necessity for secrecy is no more?" asked Alberich.

"Yes," said Draco, and then he took the quill Alberich offered and signed his name without hesitation.

The spell used on the parchment was old magic, and according to the old laws (which were practically forgotten, except in old Pureblood families), once a person was disowned, their last name was no longer theirs. However, due to legal reasons, a person could now retain their last name even in disownment although these oath spells were not changed. So Draco signed the paper 'Draco Lucius Malfoy' and, according to the spell, there wasn't a Draco Lucius Malfoy anymore, he was simply Draco Lucius, and so the spell had absolutely no hold on him. Of course, he wasn't going to tell anyone that.

"We had a last minute cancellation," said Bill, when those gathered looked questioningly at the empty desk beside Draco. "So we will have to find another code breaker, but for now, let's get started."

With everyone's attention drawn back to him, Bill began running through the overview.

"Your contacts will be scattered about Europe, gathering information on Voldemort's activities. They will send you the information in letters that are coded. It is your job to decode the letters and pass on the information to Kingsley Shacklebolt. You and your contacts will work out your own specific codes to use, but right now, we're going to go over the basics. Mr. Alberich Centworthy will begin."

Bill stepped aside as Alberich strutted forward, and Draco caught the quick eye-roll the red-haired man gave and smirked slightly.

"There are several types of coding used," Alberich began in a nasal voice. "Of course, many of these are extremely complex and so you will find that these might be a bit to complicated for you at first."

Lorenzo Holiday snorted loudly and Alberich looked extremely affronted at being interrupted so. Draco silently sighed and slouched a little in his chair, then caught Bill smiling at him in agreement. Draco was infinitely glad when Alberich quit the speech and pulled out examples of codes. They were simple, painfully so, but he knew that the others needed to start off small.

The types of codes they started were ones written in a normal letter. The date, or a name on the page, would signify which letters were to be used. If the date read 4-10-93, than the fourth letter of the message was circled, and then the tenth after that, and then the ninth and then the third and so on until sentences were formed. While that was relatively simplistic to uncode, it was a hassle to write, and not exactly Death Eater proof.

The second option they were taught was using code words, like 'Uncle Victor left for France today and we don't know when he is coming back, but rumor has it that he is bringing back a large party'. That meant that Voldemort was in France gathering more followers, and again, it was hardly clever enough to fool the Death Eaters, well, maybe Crabbe and Goyle.

The third was pulling out all of the capital letters, or all of the spelling mistakes. The fourth was taking out all of the letters on the far left row and the fifth was the last letter of every sentence.

After the simple codes, which left Draco feeling as if his brain was growing dumb from disuse, they began on the real codes, codes in Ancient Runes.

"All of you were chosen for your aptitude in Ancient Runes," said Bill, "and now we will put that to good use. Remember the style codes we just taught you and think more complicated. I want to see how fast you catch on before boring you with an unneeded lesson."

Everyone looked gratefully at Bill because Alberich had spent at least half an hour describing the all capital letter code and then Bill waved his wand and immediately the chalk boards that were beside their desks were filled half-way with the Gaelic runes.

"Find the message," said Bill. "Sit down once you have it."

Draco looked at the board, and didn't even bother getting up. The message was based on the misplacement of the nouns, and read "Four new recruits, then to Spain."

Lorenzo was the first to sit back down, and all he did was write out the answer. Granger was next, after circling the misplacements and writing it out, and everyone else was close behind her.

"Very good," said Bill. "Let's put the next one up."

The message disappeared only to be replaced with a new one. This one was the Turkish Runes and several of the runes were drawn incorrectly with squared out forms instead of rounded ones. This one read "Attack planned on Italian Ministry" and again, Draco didn't bother getting up.

The instructors noticed that he wasn't getting up the third time. Bill knew why, shooting him a quick grin, but Alberich came over to his desk.

"Do you need assistance?" he asked, preening as he spoke.

"No," said Draco shortly.

"But you are having trouble with the Runes?"

"No."

Alberich frowned, annoyance in his countenance. "Then why aren't you writing anything?"

"I don't need to write it," said Draco.

By now their conversation had attracted the attention of the other code breakers who were all turning to look at the pair.

"You're saying that you just figured this out in your head?" asked Alberich, a disbelieving note in his voice.

"Yes," said Draco simply.

"Well," said Alberich, now sounding extremely patronizing, "aren't we precocious?"

He gave a condescending smile and for a moment Draco was afraid he was going to reach out and pat his head, so he gave man a glare that promised death. Alberich looked a little startled and moved off, his strut a little less pronounced.

Draco continued to glare, even after the man had gone, but then removed his gaze to his chalk board. He figured it out in his head again and then slumped slightly in his chair. Bill stopped by, kneeling at his desk.

"I told you you'd hate him," he said in greeting, and then he smiled wickedly. "Precocious?" he asked.

Draco glowered. "Never again," he said in warning.

Bill didn't seem to take him too seriously, his hazel eyes getting a decidedly mischievous gleam and Draco silently cursed himself for rescuing the former Professor from the Death Eaters. Any threats he might give with a result in death wouldn't be taken seriously by Bill anymore, not after he saved his life.

"Hang tight," said Bill. "We'll start up some harder codes in a minute or two to save you from boredom."

Bill moved off to see if anyone had any questions, and the next code that was put up was harder. So much harder in fact that Draco actually left his seat and had to circle a few inconsistencies before finding the pattern and writing the answer down on the board. He took his time writing the hidden message, so that when he went to go sit down, Lorenzo was already seated and Granger was just finishing up. He then remembered that Bill had said not to hold back, but it was a hard habit to break, pretending to be normal.

He did better on the next message, finishing and sitting down a full twenty seconds before anyone else. Bill gave him a wide grin.

"Very good!" applauded Alberich, once everyone had regained their seat. "We will now take a short break for some refreshments."

No sooner had he spoken, a table appeared in the middle of the room with an assortment of small sandwiches, cheese and fruit, various cookies and a large bowl full of punch. Draco merely leaned back in his chair, tipping it on two feet as he watched the other code breakers intermingle. There were three women, including Granger, and they all seemed to gravitate towards one another while the four men broke off into small parties, Lorenzo and Alberich together in one group, each sizing the other up.

Draco waited until the table was clear before getting up to ladle himself some punch in a glass. He had timed it so that each group was in deep conversation before getting up, but Granger came over anyway with fierce determination in her brown eyes.

"What are you doing here Malfoy?" she asked. She was holding a plate with a sandwich on it, and her other hand held a cup, but she stood in such a way Draco knew he wasn't going to be able to brush her off easily.

"I should think it was obvious," he drawled, taking a sip of the punch which was exceptionally fruity, but he could taste the champagne mixed in.

"It appears to be obvious," said Granger, "but I don't trust you. Why are you here in a room full of Muggleborns, Half-bloods and Pureblood traitors plotting the downfall of Voldemort?"

"Wait," he said, becoming mock-alarmed. "This meeting isn't for the initiation of new Death Eaters? I thought that the Dark Lord himself would be here."

The look in Granger's eyes was reminiscent of McGonagall and it was slightly disturbing.

"I'm serious Malfoy," she said. "Are you here for some spying mission for the Dark Lord? Is this some way of getting on his good side?"

"And what if I am?" asked Draco. "There's really nothing you can do about it."

"Don't be so sure, Malfoy," said Hermione.

"What?" asked Draco. "Going to tell your precious Order on me? I'm scared Granger, truly scared." It was said sneeringly and he could see the color rush into Hermione's cheeks as she got angry.

"A common emotion for a Death Eater to be feeling," she said. "Always cowering before Voldemort, hurrying to do his bidding so you make him happy."

"You seem to know an awful lot about it," said Draco. "Have you been to the meetings without telling me, Granger? We could have gone to coffee afterwards or something."

"So you have been to the meetings then!" said Hermione triumphantly.

Draco shrugged. "Not recently," he admitted. "I've been out of the country and just got back a few days ago."

A hand dropped on his shoulder, squeezing it warningly. Draco didn't bother attacking the person who dared touch him; he already knew it was Bill.

"Draco," said Bill warningly. "Do try to get along with the other code breakers, alright?"

"I was getting along swimmingly. She accused me of spying." Draco tried to shrug Bill's hand off, but the former-professor only tightened his fingers, not painfully so, but enough to let Draco know that Bill was not amused.

"Hermione," said Bill, now turning his attention to the girl, "what was one of the precautionary methods used on you before you were admitted into the operation?"

"Veritaserum," said Hermione.

"Now, since we know that you are not in league with the Dark Lord, and that your parents are Muggles, but we still used Veritaserum, don't you think we would have been doubly cautious with someone like Draco?"

"Yes," said Hermione, blushing a little.

"So, no more of these accusations, then. Alright?"

Hermione nodded.

"And Draco," said Bill.

Draco raised an eyebrow.

"Don't be such a prat," said Bill. "Besides, both of you are the Heads for Hogwarts this year and you need to get along."

Hermione gaped. "Him?" she asked incredulously. "Head Boy?"

But Bill was already leaving, so Draco took the opportunity to speak up.

"Who else did you think it would be?" he asked. "Potter? The Boy-Who-Couldn't-Even-Die?"

"Harry would be ten times better than you as Head Boy," said Hermione stoutly, but there was more to her voice than just defensiveness for a friend. There was pride as well, accompanied by a faint flush to the cheeks.

Draco raised an eyebrow. "You seem to be rather touchy on the Potter subject," he commented, and watched as the blush deepened.

"It's none of your business, Malfoy," said Hermione.

"So you are dating him then," said Draco, getting a wicked gleam in his eyes. "You're dating Scar-head."

"Don't call him that."

"How long have you been dating him now?" asked Draco. "Did it break Weasel's heart that you broke up with him or are you having a weird threesome relationship?"

"You are sick!" said Hermione. "And for your information, Ron is fine with me dating Harry and has a girlfriend himself."

"Why are you trying to convince me?" asked Draco. "Or are you just trying to convince yourself?"

Hermione gave a frustrated groan and walked away. Draco smirked, downed his champagne punch, and left the glass on the table, opting to return to his seat and wait for everyone to finish up.

It took another ten minutes, but everyone finally returned to their seats and the food disappeared. The codes started again, and this time they were the real thing.

It took Draco five minutes to decode the first one. He stared at the board for a good three minutes, his fingers tapping out his 1-3-2-4 pattern before he actually started to write, then once he did, he didn't stop until he had the answer and sat back down at his desk. He had finished a minute before Lorenzo and a minute and a half before Hermione.

Lorenzo muttered something about 'the cheating boy stealing my work' that everyone heard, but no one responded to, partially because Draco knew that they were all wondering the same thing. Since when did the teenaged prat son of Lucius Malfoy become a genius? As far as they knew, never, but they did know that, as the son of Lucius Malfoy, he would not be opposed to 'borrowing' someone else's work.

By the next code, everyone was too busy to be wondering if he was stealing work or not. The codes were intricate, confusing, and extremely well hidden, and the instructors started making rounds, explaining how things worked and checking over answers. As soon as one code was completed and checked, the teachers put another in its place.

Forty-minutes went by before the next, and last, break. This one was unscheduled as Dumbledore entered the room, beaming and twinkling at the lot of them.

"Headmaster," said Bill, coming over as the code breakers gratefully stopped scribbling away on the chalkboards and stretched, hiding yawns behind dust-covered fingers.

"I came to see how things were going," said Dumbledore. "You seem to be quite the task master Bill."

Bill grinned. "I think they are doing quite well," he said.

"Do you mind if I challenge them a little bit?" asked Dumbledore.

"Of course not," said Bill. "What did you have in mind?"

"I have a code here," said Dumbledore, pulling a piece of parchment out of his pocket. "It's on the difficult side, but I was wondering if they were up to the challenge."

Bill turned to the code breakers, who were all shamelessly listening to the conversation.

"Well?" he asked. "Feeling up to it?"

There were a few nods, and some 'Yes's' so Dumbledore walked over to the front board, erased it with a wave of his wand, and then with another wave, the smooth surface was covered with symbols.

"You can converse with each other if you like," said Bill. "And once we have this one figured out, we'll call it a day."

The code breakers stared at the board, some people grouping together to talk quietly. Draco merely stared at the board, the fingers in his right hand tapping out the pattern double-time. Fifteen minutes later and he was still staring at the board.

"I think I have something," said Lorenzo. Immediately all eyes, except Draco's, turned to the translator.

"Well?" asked Harriet Lester.

"Yes," said Lorenzo. "I do indeed have something." He pulled his chalk board up to the front, the wheels on the wooden stand squeaking obnoxiously, which was what made Draco finally take notice of the man.

"So, what is it?" asked Luther Ross.

"I'm not quite done yet," said Lorenzo, picking up his chalk again. "But I'm just about done translating here. I've got 'You-Know-Who to the north' so far."

"I don't know," said Hermione. "Is that right? A code wouldn't really say Voldemort's name, would it?"

"It doesn't say his name," said Lorenzo condescendingly. "It says-,"

"You're wrong," said Draco, speaking up over him.

Everyone turned to look at him.

"Excuse me?" said Lorenzo in an annoyed, who-the-hell-do-you-think-you-are tone of voice.

"I said you're wrong," said Draco.

Lorenzo looked more than annoyed now. "The message reads 'You-Know-Who to the north, so far. It makes sense."

"Actually," said Draco, "if you were to continue along your lines of translation the message would read 'You-Know-Who to the north to gather eight more recruits before returning to Kansas along with Dorothy and the Munchkins'. Unless the Dark Lord has a new affinity for American novels, you've strayed off the yellow brick road."

Draco could hear Bill smother a chuckle. Lorenzo turned an unflattering shade of fuchsia.

"Well, then," he said scathingly. "Let's see if you can do any better!"

He marched down from the front of the room and thrust the piece of chalk into Draco's hand and gestured him to go forward. Draco slowly walked forward, still staring at the board.

There was no other code, as far as Draco could tell, besides the one about Kansas and Dorothy. He had read over the rest of the Runes, and had come to that conclusion. He frowned as his eyes kept straying to the out-of-place adjectives that made up the erroneous message, and then he froze. If there was no other code in the rest of the letter, than the code must be inside the fake code.

His fingers flew through the pattern as he stared at the fake message. 'You-Know-Who to the north to gather eight more recruits before returning to Kansas along with Dorothy and the Munchkins'. Think, now, there must be something there…

He flipped Lorenzo's board over onto the clean side and began to write, the sound of his chalk hitting the black board echoed through the silent room. The message had used 'You-Know-Who'. No code-maker worth his salt waste time trying to incorporate that name into a message.

The message was in the Greek dialect, which used hieroglyphics, but each glyph was an actual letter, as in 'a,b,c,' etc, except in it's own alphabet. It was also based on a number system, much like the Hebrew language, with each letter pertaining to a number, i.e. 'a 1; b 2'. The glyphs spelling out You-Know-Who then must be part of the code.

In the Greek Dialect, 'You-Know-Who' is spelled with six letters, and it actually is closer to the 'unnamed one' translation wise. If those six letters were than taken back to their number form, Draco got the numbers 2, 16, 7, 11, 30, and 21. By counting out the words in the message, he could see that the numbers all pointed to words starting with a large-print glyph, much like a capital letter in English. The only thing was, those words didn't make since together. He tried every combination possible, but he was still stumped.

He backed up a bit, surveying the glyphs he had. They were the right markings, he was sure of – Oh!

One of the distinguishing characteristics about the Greek dialect is that the larger-print glyphs look very much like the Syrian glyphs, which meant that if he looked at the hieroglyphics from the Syrian dialect and took the first letter from each word that corresponded with the glyph than he had it.

He wrote out the answer, which was a mere six letter word 'caught'.

He put the chalk down and stepped away from the board, catching the grin on Bill's face and smiling ever-so slightly. Someone started to clap, Draco didn't know who, but he could feel a faint flush rising in his cheeks and he quickly stepped back, even as the applause built.

Dumbledore applauded as well. "Quite nicely done," he said. "Most impressive."

"Indeed," said Bill. "Now, what can the rest of you learn from this? Yes, Harriet?"

"Sometimes the wrong code is the right one, just uncompleted?" she asked.

"Yes, very well put," said Bill.

"Sometimes two dialects are used?" shouted out Chadwick, a university student.

"Very good," said Bill. "Anyone else?"

"Pride cometh before the fall?" asked Luther, who didn't very much care for Lorenzo.

There were several chuckles and Lorenzo pretended not to notice.

"Yes," said Bill, also hiding a smile. "Very well then, you can all leave. Your contacts will be meeting with you sometime in the near future to discuss codes and what not. If you have any questions, speak to Albus Dumbledore who is the head of this operation."

The code breakers didn't run out, which was somewhat surprising, considering how late it was and how hard they had been working. What was even more surprising was the fact that several of them came up to congratulate Draco on figuring out Dumbledore's code, including Granger.

"Look, Malfoy," she said. "I still don't like you, but if Dumbledore trusts you than it's good enough for me. And you did good there, with the code."

She looked at him slightly belligerently, as if daring him to ruin the beginning of an unsteady truce, but Draco merely nodded, and that was it.

After she left, Dumbledore approached. "I suppose now is a good time to come through on my side of our bargain," he said, eyes twinkling. "If you come in on Monday, around noon, Severus will be here and you can speak with him. Floo into my office; I'll have it open for you."

"Thank you," said Draco, but Dumbledore didn't leave. Instead, the Headmaster looked at him a little curiously.

"I don't suppose you have a sister, do you?" he asked.

"I'm sorry, what?" asked Draco, wondering what had brought this unexpected question on.

Dumbledore paused, waiting for Harriet and Luther to make their way outside, leaving Draco, Dumbledore, Bill, and Kingsley alone in the room.

"The Sorting Hat recently sent out the letters to first years," he said. "One was addressed to Delaney L. Chalmers, an eleven year old girl."

"Never heard of her," said Draco.

"Yes, well, her last name was hyphenated," said Dumbledore. "As if her name had been changed. It said Chalmers-Malfoy. I don't suppose you have an illegitimate sister?"

Draco paled slightly, Bill halfway reaching out to him, but stopping.

"Draco?" inquired Dumbledore.

Draco shook his head. "Not a sister," he said. "I had a brother, Lukas, but he died, ten years ago."

"Are you sure he is dead?" asked Dumbledore.

Draco laughed, mirthlessly. "I saw the Avada myself, but…," he trailed off. "The address," he said. "Was it a Muggle address?"

"Yes," said Dumbledore.

Draco frowned. "Then I think I have a niece."

Albus made his way up the sidewalk of a small but pleasant looking house. He was in a Muggle neighborhood, but he was still wearing his robes, more specifically his deep purple robes with silver sparkly stars that he was quite partial to. It was one of the benefits of being so old; people looked over the oddities of age. He rang the doorbell and it was answered by a woman in her mid-thirties.

She looked at him curiously and he took the time to study her as well. She had short dark hair, not quite black, but almost there, and a face that was pretty in an approachable, pleasant kind of way. Her eyes were doe brown and inviting and her short stature made her look extremely innocent and sweet.

"Miss Chalmers?" he asked.

"Yes," she said. "I'm Samantha."

"I'm Albus Dumbledore," he said, and she immediately recognized his name.

"From the letter," she said. "Hogwarts, right?"

"Yes, indeed," said Dumbledore. "May I come in?"

"Oh, yes," said Samantha. "I'm sorry, do come in. Would you like any tea?"

"That would be wonderful," said Dumbledore, entering the house and following her into the kitchen. He took a seat at the table while she put the kettle on.

"Was there something wrong in the letter?" asked Samantha, joining him and tucking a short piece of hair behind her ear. "Is Laney still invited?"

"Oh, yes, of course," said Dumbledore. "It's just that I need to know, for security purposes, who her father is."

A look of understanding crossed Samantha's face. "It's because of Luke's father, isn't it?" she asked. "Lucius, wasn't it?"

"So, Delaney is the child of Lukas Malfoy," said Dumbledore.

"Yes," said Samantha, "but he didn't have Malfoy as his last name, because he was illegitimate. When we married, he just took my last name. Rather unconventional, but his mother's family wasn't to keen on the marriage either."

"You were married?" asked Dumbledore, surprised at this bit.

Samantha looked a bit startled. "Yes," she said, raising her left hand where she was wearing an elegant ring made of thin gold strands braided together. "We were married six months before he told his mother, and then when I had Laney he went to tell his father, but he never came back and-," she cut off abruptly, taking in a breath before continuing. "He had planned ahead, for the off-chance he might not return, but I had no clue. After a week past, I got a letter in which he apologized and explained what I was to do to access his funds."

"I am sorry for your loss," said Dumbledore. "How much are you aware of the wizarding world?"

"Enough to know that Luke's parents are prejudiced against Muggles and that a few years before there was a type of war against magical people with non-magical parents," said Samantha. "But wasn't the Lord-person responsible killed?"

"He never died," said Dumbledore. "He has returned to power and things are not exactly stable in the wizarding world right now. If people knew that Lucius' illegitimate son was married to a Muggle and that they had a child, it would cause uproar among the Death Eater ranks."

"Those are the bad ones, right?" asked Samantha.

"Yes," said Dumbledore.

"And you think Laney might be in danger?"

"She could be a target," said Dumbledore. "Which is why I needed to know, so we can keep an eye on her."

"Are you going to disguise her? Put her in a protection program?"

"No," said Dumbledore, "I have no doubt that her uncle will be quite capable of protecting her from the wrong sort of attention."

"You're talking about Draco, aren't you?" asked Samantha.

"You know him?" asked Dumbledore.

"It was how Luke and I met," said Samantha. "I'm a veterinarian and I went to Paris on an exchange program twelve years ago. I was doing a presentation on chimps and Luke had brought Draco, and that's how we met. He flirted with me, rather obviously, when I was showing the monkeys around. Later that day I was having trouble getting directions back to my hotel, and Luke and Draco just happened by, and we went to dinner together. Luke and I stayed in touch and hit it off." She fell silent for a moment, before speaking again. "If Draco is Lucius' real son and if he's protecting her, won't more attention be put on Laney?"

"Most likely," said Dumbledore, becoming serious, "however, Draco has grown up around dark wizards and witches and is quite…capable for one his age. I have no doubt that he will be Laney's best choice for protection."

"If he's grown up around Lucius, won't he be prejudiced, like the rest of them?"

"I have no doubt that he is prejudice, to a point," said Dumbledore, "but he refused to join Lord Voldemort, who is the leader of the dark wizards."

"I don't know," said Samantha, her brown eyes pensive and worried. "Maybe I should just keep Laney home."

"Could you really do that?" asked Dumbledore gently.

"No," admitted Samantha. "She already knows that her father was a wizard. I couldn't take this opportunity away from her. She was born magical and she deserves to go."

"I believe that Draco deserves to see his niece as well," said Dumbledore. "He was there when Lukas was killed, and from what I understand, he and his half-brother were very close. Meeting Laney would do him good."

He remembered what Draco had looked like when he had revealed that he might have a niece.

"Then I think I have a niece," he had said, frowning slightly.

"Would you like to go meet her?" asked Dumbledore. "I could give you the addre-,"

"No," said Draco, too quickly for someone as calm as he looked, which made Dumbledore notice the slight flickering in the grey eyes. No doubt Bill could read that flicker better than he could.

"Don't you want to know if Lukas really did have a daughter?" asked Bill softly.

"I-," Draco began, but then he cut off, spinning about abruptly and grabbing at a decidedly Muggle looking jacket then roughly pulling it on. "I have to get back," he said, not looking at any of them.

"Would you like me to go?" asked Bill. "I'll check it out, and if it is Lukas' daughter, I'll let you know, alright?"

"Actually," said Dumbledore, "I have to go meet her anyway. If there is a child from a Muggle woman that is even remotely connected to the Malfoy line, then the child may become a target."

Draco shrugged, finally turning around to face them. His eyes were cold once again and he merely nodded to them curtly. "Good day," he said, and left the room.

Dumbledore turned to Bill, wondering if he could translate the actions as well as he could translate Ancient Runes. Bill was watching the door bang shut with a sympathetic expression in his eyes and then he looked at Dumbledore.

"Lukas and Draco were close from what I understand," said Bill. "Lukas would spend the summers with Draco, until he revealed that he was intending on marrying a Muggle woman. That's when the Avada hit him, and Draco saw the whole thing. He was only seven at the time."

"Merlin," muttered Kingsley, speaking up for the first time.

"Lucius killed his own son?" asked Dumbledore.

"No," said Bill. "It was Lucius' mother, Draco's grandmother. A year later and she dies, and Draco is pretty certain that Lucius poisoned her, and then Lucius packs the entire family up and they move to England."

"Shit," said Kingsley succinctly. "That's a messed up family."

Dumbledore brought himself out of his musings to see Samantha nod.

"Luke always spoke fondly of Draco," she said. "Do you know how to contact him?"

"Actually," said Dumbledore, "I was hoping you would write him." He pulled out a piece of parchment and a quill from his pocket.

Samantha took them, looking in askance at the quill.

"It has ink already in it," explained Dumbledore. "Like your pens." He didn't mention that the ink was actually spelled inside.

Samantha nodded and then hesitated slightly, before writing out a short message. She re-read it once she was done and then nodded, folding up the letter and handing it back.

"Thank you," she said.

The front door banged open and Samantha smiled. "Would you like to meet Laney?"

So! In the next chapter, Draco meets Laney, gets in a fight with attacking Death Eaters, and we see our first bit of Ginny, but remember people, this is pre-D/G, so don't expect romance straight off. Please review!





6. Delaney ChalmersMalfoy

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, hence I have taken to living the nocturnal life of the overnight shift. I am starting to feel a strange connection to raccoons.

AUTHOR'S NOTE: Alright, so I didn't update Monday, but it's not my fault. I had half an hour before work, right, and so I had everything ready to go and I was just grammar checking, I even had the document uploaded and was about to add it on, when I was forced into a family game, which, normally I don't mind, but I was like 'Nooo! What will my reviewers say?' So, my apologies, and blame the parents.

Jewals971: He does indeed. Thanks for the review!

Draco hesitated for what must have been the thousandth time that morning, and then cursed himself for what must have been the millionth time. Honestly, he was just taking the girl to Diagon Alley for school supplies and what not, how hard could it be?

Yeah, well it's not everyday you meet your estranged niece from your murdered half-brother who was secretly married to a woman who was looked down upon as garbage, he thought morosely. So, maybe I'm actually doing pretty well.

He discarded that thought immediately. He was practically having conversations with himself, how stable could he be? He forced himself to walk up the drive and then step on the porch. His hand rang the bell and he waited for a tense eleven seconds before the door opened and Draco stared.

"You're the monkey lady," he said, his mind in shock. He had not expected to recognize her.

She apparently hadn't expected to be recognized either because she blinked, looking quite startled. "Yes," she said. "I didn't think you would remember. You were only, what, five?"

"Yeah," said Draco, stepping inside as she opened the screen door for him. He held up the box he was carrying when she looked at it strangely. "It's for Delaney," he said awkwardly.

"I'll go get her," said Samantha. "Come into the den."

She led him into a small room that seemed extremely cozy as it was furnished in an array of tans and burgundies. Almost like Gryffindor colors.

"I'll be right back," she promised, leaving the room and calling up for the girl.

Draco felt unsteady. His stomach was in knots and his fingers blundered through their pattern and he wondered how rude it would be if he just walked out, but then Samantha was returning with a little girl in tow. Draco's mind went blank.

The girl was small for her age, but adorable, with long, curly hair that was the same shade of almost-black as her mother's. Her face shape was like Samantha's too, round and pleasant, though she had the Malfoy pale skin with a smattering of freckles on her nose and cheeks. That was not why Draco was staring. He stared because her eyes were a startling blue that Draco had only seen once before, on a man who had white-blond hair and a wide grin.

"Shit," he breathed, and then he was kneeling on the floor and the girl was running to him to fling her arms around his neck, saying 'Hello, Uncle Draco'.

She pulled back a little bit and Draco looked up to Samantha, who was smiling with understanding, obviously realizing what a shock it was to see Lukas' eyes in the girl's face.

"Are you a wizard too?" the little girl was asking, her blue eyes wide and excited.

"Uh, yes," said Draco. "I'm going to take you to wizard stores to get you stuff for school."

The child grinned, her smile an exact replica of her mother's, warm and full of happiness. Draco picked up the box he had brought and handed it to the girl.

"This is for you," he said, wondering if he was supposed to say anything else, but Delaney was already tearing the box open and pulling out a beautiful, light cloak in a stunning lavender shade.

"Is this what witches wear?" she asked, pulling the cloak around her shoulders and fumbling with the clasp. Draco reached out quite naturally, which surprised him, and fastened it for her.

"You'll be the best-dressed witch in all of Diagon Alley," he promised, because he somehow knew that one was supposed to say things like that to a niece.

She beamed, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and then ran over to her mother, twirling about so that the cloak billowed out around her. Draco blinked, stopping himself from reaching up to touch the spot where she kissed him, and then stood as Samantha patted her daughter's head and then told her to go get her shoes.

They both watched as she ran up the stairs and then turned to each other.

"You look like him," said Samantha softly. "The same hair and skin. Your eyes are different though."

Draco nodded. "She has his eyes."

"I'm glad she does," said Samantha. "I was almost hoping she would have his hair, your hair, too, but if anything, I'm glad she has his eyes."

She reached out to touch his hair, and he held himself still, willing himself not to flinch as her fingers gently brushed through his white-blond locks.

"You're seventeen now?" she asked, changing the mood as she pulled back from his hair.

"Yes," said Draco. "Seventeen is adult in the wizarding world."

"So young," said Samantha, shaking her head.

"I'll take care of her," Draco promised, sensing where this conversation was headed.

Samantha nodded, but she didn't look very reassured.

"You could come too," offered Draco. "Lots of Muggles go with their kids to get school supplies. I could show you around, if you wanted?"

"No," said Samantha. "Me and the magical world combining is what got Lukas killed, so I'll just wait here. No keeping her out past her bedtime, though."

Draco's lips quirked up at that, and then Delaney came back down. She had changed to match her cloak. She was wearing dark blue jeans and a green t-shirt with small lavender flowers on it. Her sneakers were white and she was carrying a lavender hair tie, holding it out to her mother.

"Could you braid my hair?" she asked.

"Sure, sweetie," said Samantha.

Draco watched as the short woman expertly entwined the dark hair into a neat plait, even though Delaney could hardly stand still. When the hair-do was finally completed, Delaney reached back to make sure it was neat and then made sure her cloak was fastened properly.

"Do you have a cloak too?" she asked. "It's chilly outside."

Draco smirked at that, though it was more of a smile, and he pulled out his wand, transfiguring the navy sweater he was wearing back into a navy cloak. He was wearing a white button-up underneath, along with a pair of jeans so that he didn't look too strange in the Muggle neighborhood.

Delaney's eyes went wide at the display of magic.

"Will I learn to do that?" she asked.

"You'll learn a lot cooler stuff," said Draco. "Like love potions, and levitating charms, and how to Apparate."

"What's Apparate?"

"Disappearing from one place and appearing in another," said Draco.

"Can you do that?" asked Delaney.

"Yeah," said Draco.

"Can you teach me that now?"

Samantha laughed slightly. "Wait until school starts, alright?"

Delaney looked somewhat disappointed, so Draco spoke up.

"If you hold my hand, I'll Apparate us to Diagon Alley," he said.

Delaney grinned, but Samantha looked a little worried.

"Can you do that?" she asked.

"I have my Apparating license," said Draco, "and when I took the test, I got a perfect score."

"How long have you had your license for?"

"A couple of months," said Draco. "I took it when I was in New York, but I reapplied for it here. If it makes you feel better, I've been Apparating without a license for years now."

"Hearing that you've been breaking the law does not make me feel better," said Samantha.

"Well, I haven't gotten caught," said Draco, "so that must mean I'm good, right?"

She cracked a reluctant smile. "Alright," she said. "Just be careful."

"I will," Draco promised.

Samantha pulled a parchment out of her pocket. "Here's her school list. If you bring a receipt back, I'll pay you back for her school stuff."

"Actually," said Draco, "I've got quite a large amount of money in my bank account, so I was wondering if you would let me pay for her."

Samantha hesitated. "Lukas set up an account so that Laney's schooling and supplies would be paid for, if she turned out to be magical, so it's really no problem."

"But I'd like to," said Draco seriously.

She held his gaze for a moment, and then nodded. "Okay then," she said, and handed him the paper. "Laney, come here and give your mother a kiss good-bye."

Laney did. "Bye, Mum!" she said.

"Behave for your uncle," said Samantha, as Draco held out his hand.

"I will," said Laney, grasping his hand with her own small one.

"Hold tight," said Draco. "This isn't the most comfortable thing in the world."

And then they disappeared from the den with a crack and found themselves in the corner of a street in Diagon Alley. Draco immediately turned to Delaney to see if she was alright, because Apparating can be disorienting, but she was grinning widely.

"That was wicked!" she said, and then she stared, her eyes wide as she took in the bustling, crowded streets.

Draco looked as well, trying to see it all from a new person's perspective. The shops were packed full of people shopping. Witches with large bags in colorful robes with their children, wizards shouting to each other across the street, and teenagers dressed in strange combinations of magical-Muggle clothes with their friends. All the while, strange contraptions went off in store front windows, and parents magicked their children back to them, and those just of age showed off charms and jinxs.

He could feel Laney's hand tighten around his own and he squeezed it reassuringly.

"Let's go get you your wand," he said.

It was the right thing to say. A wand would mean that she belonged in this chaotic world and she nodded, still holding onto his hand as he led her to Ollivanders.

The shop was empty of costumers, something that Draco was grateful of because he didn't want Laney to be subjected to any strange looks, seeing as she was in the company of a Malfoy. That would come later, hopefully much later.

"Ahhh," said Ollivander, shuffling in from the back of the store. "Mr. Malfoy. It's been quite awhile since you were in here. Took almost the entire afternoon to get you your wand. Thirteen inches, walnut, thestral hair core, flexible if the case demanded, but not easily pliable, a powerful, if not rather dark combination."

The way he said it was not condemning, and Draco remembered standing in the shop, trying wand after wand while Lucius beamed proudly down on him. Somehow his father liked the fact that he was so hard to match, because Malfoys should not be commonplace.

"And who is this?" asked Ollivander, bending down to peer at Laney, who shied a little under his gaze.

"My niece," said Draco, noting that he had a faint tone of pride in his voice at the words. "Delaney Chalmers-Malfoy."

Ollivander looked surprised, but he didn't ask any prying questions, another thing Draco was grateful for.

"Off to Hogwarts then?" Ollivander asked Laney kindly. She nodded, and Ollivander opened up a wand box lying on the counter and handed it to the girl.

"Try this," he said. "Cherry wood with dragon heartstring. Eleven inches."

Laney looked to Draco and, at his nod of encouragement, took the wand, looking at it curiously.

"Wave it about," said Ollivander. She did, but nothing happened and Ollivander immediately snatched it away. "No," he muttered, "not that at all. Let's see, here."

Dogwood, phoenix feather, twelve inches. Nothing. Elm, unicorn hair, ten inches. Nothing. Oak, griffin feather, thirteen inches. A few boxes exploded and Laney hastily dropped the wand, looking startled and quite mortified.

"Not to worry, m'dear," said Ollivander. "You should have seen what your uncle did when I handed him a phoenix feather wand. The lights exploded, the shelves toppled, and half the wand boxes went into flame." He suddenly stopped, looking thoughtful, and turned to Draco with a serious expression. "I sold that wand to Harry Potter."

Draco was surprised at that coincidence, but not shocked in anyway. He and Potter were complete opposites and it made sense that the wand didn't work for him.

"Of course," said Ollivander, "the reason I gave it to you to try was that the phoenix that gave the feather for Harry's wand, was the same phoenix that gave a feather for a wand to a boy nearly fifty years ago, Tom Riddle."

If Draco had been a more expressive person, he would have gaped. As it was, he merely blinked and his eyebrow was raised.

"Aha!" said Ollivander, pulling a wand off the top of a shelf. "Here we go. Try this one. Twelve inches, willow, with unicorn hair and has just the right amount of spring in it."

Laney took it hesitantly and waved it about. Bright blue sparks shot from the tip of the wand and Laney stared in awe at what she had just done, before turning to Draco with an amazed grin.

"I did that?" she asked with a breathless voice.

"You did indeed," said Draco, feeling his own lips twitch up at her joy. "Now, no doing magic outside of school," he said. "You're not allowed. Do you want the wand in a box, or do you want to hold it?"

"Hold it," she said immediately.

"Very well," said Ollivander, smiling down at her as well.

Draco paid him twelve galleons and two sickles, and then they exited the shop, one of Laney's hands clutching her new wand, and one clutching Draco's.

They bought her potion supplies and cauldron first, opting to use the mail delivery system so they didn't have to carry around their purchases all day. It took longer than Draco was planning because Laney stopped to gaze at everything along the way, and then asked Draco to explain it.

He had thought that he would be annoyed at her constant prattle and unending curiosity, but the frustration he was waiting for never came which surprised him. So did the funny warm feeling that came from the direction of his heart when he watched her.

He knew that he was capable of love. He would even say that he loved his father, although most of the time the love was buried under layers of confusion, anger, betrayal and frustration, and those tempered the positive feelings towards his father. He might even go as far as to say that he loved Bill like a brother, but he was still slightly wary around the ex-professor. With Laney, he was not wondering if she was trying to manipulate him, or if she had some sort of ulterior motive. She was a child, and she was innocent, and she was his responsibility. She also liked him. He could tell by the way she held his hand even as she grew braver and the way she smiled at him. It made him want to smile back. He didn't.

They finally reached Flourish and Blotts and began to buy school books. It was actually very simple, as there were individual shelves for each year at Hogwarts, and all they really needed to do was to pick up one of everything. He was just adding a Potions text to the pile in his arm when there was a scream outside. Not a happy, I'm-delighted-to-see-you-again scream, and not an oh-my-goodness-he-stole-my-wallet scream, but an ear-piercing, terrified scream.

He immediately dropped the books, pulling out his wand and pushing Laney behind him. The store front window shattered before he could see the cause of the alarm, and he could tell by the blue of the curse that it was intentional. He dropped to the ground, dragging Laney with him and covering her small body with his own as the glass flew in.

He could hear the beginning of chaos. There were frightened yelps and cries of pain from the other costumers inside the store, but outside there were shouts, sounds of smashing windows, large crashes and shrieks of fear and agony.

He scrambled to his feet, ducking low as he ran to the shattered window and looked out. He could see witches and wizards fleeing down the alley, panic written on their faces as they grabbed at loved ones and ran, looking back over their shoulder. He couldn't see what they were running from, the street was too crowded, people ran into one another in their hurry to get out of the way.

Bright flashes of curses began flying over the crowd and he could see buildings start collapsing from the direction everyone seemed to be fleeing from. The curses cleared out the streets faster than a repelling charm and Draco could see why they were running.

A pack of Death Eaters was coming from the end of the street, walking proud, masked-heads held high. There must have been twenty of them, casting the spells, dark and destructive ones. He could here the screams of the people inside the buildings that were being targeted, and it was only a matter of moments until they reached Flourish and Blotts. It was only a matter of moments before they reached himself and Laney.

He ran back to his niece, who was sitting on the ground behind a bookcase, eyes wide and scared. She was trembling. He took her by the shoulders and looked deep into her eyes.

"Laney, I need you to stay right here, okay? Do not move from this spot."

"Don't go!" Her hands clutched at his cloak. "I don't want to be all alone." She was starting to cry, her face whiter than snow and her trembling only worsened. She was beginning to panic. He shook her slightly.

"Laney, I have to go. There are bad wizards out there and I have to stop them. Stay here, alright?"

"N-no. I don't want you to go, you can't go!" The last was a scream. She was beyond scared now.

"Laney!" he said sharply and she took a shaky breath, visibly trying to stop crying. "I will be right back, I promise." He could hear the Death Eaters getting closer, and risked a glance out the window and then turned back to Laney. "Stay here. I will come back for you."

She nodded once, and he squeezed her shoulders in reassurance and then ran to the window, staying low to the ground before peering out. The Death Eaters were close and he raised his wand, twirling it once before bringing it down.

The pavement in front of the approaching Death Eaters exploded in a roar of fire, cobblestones and dirt. Draco vaulted out of the window and took his position in the middle of the street, his head held high, his wand raised, and his cold, grey eyes glinting darkly in anticipation. He was the second shock that the occupants of Diagon Alley received, the first being the Death Eaters. He was the first thing that the Death Eaters saw when the smoke finally cleared, the first thing that caused them a sense of alarm.

Draco smirked.

The Death Eaters attacked first. Draco didn't bother to block their curses, or even reflect them. He Disapparated, or rather, 'flash stepped'.

'Flash stepping' is used to describe the quick repetitions of Disapparations and Apparations that an advanced dueler will use to fight his enemy. Most wizards who reach that level have a pattern they follow, sometimes Apparating in a circle or crisscrossing pattern. Those on the next level may have several patterns they use to follow less of a predictable design. The very best have no pattern, but while they are dueling, they choose their next position. Draco was one of the very best.

He appeared right in the middle of the Death Eaters, spinning slightly to hit his pre-designated target and then staying another split second to send off two more curses. He flash stepped again, this time appearing on the outskirts of the battle and disabling two more before stepping again.

Draco was a Slytherin, meaning that he liked to fight his battles undetected, usually from the safety of hiding spots; however, he knew that he would be unable to fight off twenty Death Eaters by himself. So he charged right in like a Gryffindor, hoping that his blatant display of foolish bravery would encourage the other shoppers and store keepers to help fight as well.

His gamble paid off, rather quickly too. There was the sound of several voices raised in a battle cry, and then the Death Eaters found themselves under the attack of three others. Draco got a glimpse of a brunette, a red-head, and a black haired boy. It could only be the Golden Trio.

The irony of the Golden Trio coming to his aid was not lost on Draco, however, at the moment he was too busy to do anything besides raise an eyebrow. He flash stepped again, appearing right behind the group of Death Eaters that were fighting the three friends, and took two of them out before retreating to a safer position.

After Harry Potter joined the fray, the battle was over within moments. It wasn't because Potter was a top-notch dueler; it was because the public flocked to their hero and joined in as well. Then, once the threat of the Death Eaters was for the most part subdued, the Aurors showed up, locking those who hadn't been smart enough to Apparate away in chains.

Draco surveyed the scene before allowing himself to relax marginally. The middle of the street was filled with Aurors holding Death Eaters and pulling off their masks while others tried to hold the crowd back as much as possible. A few key witnesses were being interrogated, pointing to certain Death Eaters and talking much louder than necessary. Satisfied that the threat was gone, he turned back to Flourish and Blotts.

The store front had been damaged in the fight. The wall left of the door was caved in and the door itself was off its hinges. Draco felt a moment of fear, but upon entering the store, he realized that the inside was uncompromised.

"Laney?" he called, striding over the bookcase he had left her at. "Laney?"

She wasn't there.

Draco stared at the empty area, his gut seeming to clench suddenly in worry and concern, emotions he wasn't used to feeling. He turned on his heel, his eyes scanning the shop, still feeling the clenching inside.

"Laney?" he called, his voice having a slight edge to it. "Laney, where the hell are you?"

No one answered. The shop was empty.

He left the shop, not quite running, but almost. His grey eyes flickered all about the people as he tore through the crowd. The tightness in his chest was almost painful.

"Laney! Laney, where are you?"

He spotted a burst of lavender and started towards it instantly. It was Laney, he could see it now. She was with a teenaged girl, he didn't really take note of the girl, except that she looked like one of those females he generally avoided, the kind, innocent ones. He could tell because of the clothes she was wearing, stylish but modest, and by the way she held herself. He ignored her.

He practically skidded to his knees in front of his niece, his hands grabbing her shoulders tightly.

"Are you alright?" he asked urgently, looking her over and noting the overwhelmed look in the bright blue eyes. She nodded; he nearly lost it.

"The hell were you thinking running off like that?" he demanded, feeling extremely angry, and as he was a Malfoy, being angry meant that his voice went cold, and his eyes even colder. "I had no clue where you went. What if I couldn't find you again? What then, huh?"

He gave her a little shake, and then realized that she was crying and that her eyes were no longer overwhelmed but terrified. Sweet Merlin, she was scared of him.

"I'm sorry," he said contritely. "Merlin, I'm sorry Laney. You just scared me."

His hand reached up to brush her tears away and then she was flinging her arms around his neck as she sobbed. He awkwardly rubbed her back.

"The bad man broke the shop," said Laney into his shoulder. Her head was buried in his cloak and her voice was a half sob. "And he grabbed me but Nevra helped me get away."

Draco knew that 'Nevra' must be the girl Laney was with, but he wasn't paying attention to that part of the story. He pulled Laney away and looked into her eyes.

"Which man grabbed you?" he asked.

She pointed and Draco turned to see a Death Eater by the name of Winton in the grip of an Auror. He was spitting curses and oaths and he looked sinisterly triumphant. A thought flashed through Draco's mind: the Death Eater screaming at his feet and then himself casting the last curse that would ever strike the man. He was familiar with the feeling. The knowledge that he could get away with murder if he so desired was pure seduction and he turned back to Laney.

"Stay here," he said, not really paying attention to how she seemed to panic slightly at the words. He was only aware of Winton, Death Eater, the man who had tried to harm his niece.

Winton saw him coming, his face set and his grey eyes frigid. Winton was not a smart man and so he sneered and spat in Draco's direction. Draco smirked, his eyes promising death.

Winton managed to twist away from the Auror, but Draco was there then. He grasped the older, heavier man by the arm as he passed by him, turning with the man and kicking the back of his knees. Winton collapsed, face first, but Draco still held onto his arm and there was a sickening pop! as Winton's shoulder dislocated. Winton screamed, tried to move away. Draco, still holding Winton's arm up behind his back, stepped right where Winton's arm joined his back. Winton garbled intelligibly.

The Aurors didn't know what to do. Draco could see them out of the corner of his eye and so he took the opportunity to step a little harder on Winton's dislocated shoulder and leaned down to the Death Eater's ear.

"Never again will you harm her."

From the look in Winton's eye, he knew who Draco was talking about. He tried to answer back, but Draco jerked his arm. Winton gave a short cry of pain.

"Never again, or I swear by the time I am through with you, you will wish that you had never been conceived."

Draco stepped back, letting go of the man's arm and the Aurors took custody of their prisoner once again. Draco turned back to go to Laney, but hesitated slightly. Laney was being comforted by none other than Ginny Weasley. Ginevra Weasley. The Weaselette was accompanied by one of her older brother's, the dragon keeper one, Charlie, and he looked quite surprised.

Draco recovered from the shock in a split second and knelt once more by Laney who now looked more scared of him than ever. Real smart Draco, he thought to himself sarcastically, after she's been traumatized, go all torturer on the Death Eater. He pointedly ignored the Weasley siblings.

"I'm sorry," he found himself saying again. Dear Merlin, who knew this whole uncle stuff could be so hard?

"I want to go home," said Laney, sniffling slightly, looking for the entire world that she might start bawling at any moment. "I want Mum."

"Alright," said Draco placatingly. "I'll take you to Mum." He held out his arms and she left Ginny's embrace and hesitantly made her way over to him. Draco scooped her up and then stood. "Do you want to Apparate back?" he asked.

She shook her head; it figured. She probably had enough of the Wizarding World; however, Draco knew that leaving now might mean that she would quit it forever. He wasn't going to let that happen. She was a Malfoy; she belonged here.

"I'll take you to the Leaky Cauldron," he said. "We can take a cab home to your Mum."

He nodded once at Charlie and Ginny, after all, Ginny had helped his niece, and then left. He was sure to get away from the Death Eaters as quickly as possible, and then slowed his steps, before gently setting her down. She was heavy, or maybe he just needed to eat more.

It was not by coincidence that he set her down right by the pet store, so that when she got to her feet the first thing she saw was a window full of animals. He was banking on the fact that her mother's interest in animals would have either been genetically handed down or at least rubbed off on her. He bet correctly.

Laney took one look at the animals, and then another, and another.

"Do you want to go in?" asked Draco gently.

She hesitated, the remains of her tears still on her face.

"A quick look," said Draco, manipulating her and not feeling the slightest bit of guilt for doing so. He took her hand and led her in. It was the right move to make. She looked as if she was in heaven, gazing about at the animals with wide, enchanted eyes.

They spent two hours in the store. Draco, again, was surprised that he felt no frustration at the obscene amount of time spent in the presence of smelly animals. When they finally left the store, Laney held in her hands a pure white kitten. Everything a kitten could need, from a carrying basket to a knit sweater, was being shipped to the Chalmer-Malfoy house.

Draco then mentioned the fact that her new kitten might be hungry. Did Laney want to find the kitten something to eat, and maybe get a bite herself? The answer was a resounding 'yes' and so they had lunch. Draco then asked if Laney wouldn't mind going shopping real quick with Uncle Draco who needed to get a few things for school. Laney had said 'yes', because he had bought her a kitten, and they had then ended up finishing shopping for Laney as well.

They ended the day with ice cream and Laney was all smiles again, the incident with the Death Eaters completely forgotten as she fed her new kitten some ice cream. Draco felt his lips twitch up as he watched her.

Ginny had been relieved when the Death Eater attack came.

Alright, so that was phrasing it a little callously, but it was the truth. She had been spending a day shopping with Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Charlie (who was on vacation from his dragons), and between Ron and Charlie, she was getting no rest from the fact that she had gone on dates with at least six different guys last school year. The 'at least' was because she had gone on friendly luncheons that may have been taken as a date by the male she was accompanying, although she only counted six as real dates.

It wasn't that she was loose, or flirty, it was just that she had a lot of friends who were guys. After all, she had grown up with six brothers and so she related well with the male species and because she hung out with mostly guys, they often, at some point in time, wanted to try a serious relationship. Personally, she did as well, if only so that people would stop talking about her crush on Harry Potter. Honestly!

So, when the Death Eater attack did come, she didn't panic and was somewhat relieved that her topic of boyfriends was changed. For as much as Hermione was a nice person, the seventh year girl wasn't helping her at all.

They were upstairs in Flourish and Blotts when the store was hit. Everyone ran to the window to see the Death Eaters strutting down the street like the owned the place. No one was trying to stop them, or even taking action and summoning the Aurors. They were like scurrying ants.

Harry had immediately turned to Hermione and Ron.

"Are you guys ready?" he had asked.

"I'm with you, mate," said Ron, and Hermione nodded as well. The three pulled out their wands, glancing outside to take in the position of the Death Eaters, and that's when they all saw the road in front of the Death Eaters explode, and the white-blond striding out in the middle of the street to face them, head held high and wand out.

"Malfoy?" breathed Ron in shock, and then the battle began.

"Come on," said Harry, starting for the stairs. "At least he's got the right idea."

Ginny noted that he seemed rather accepting of the fact that Draco Malfoy, son of infamous Death Eater Lucius Malfoy, Slytherin prat, and Ice Prince was currently battling the Death Eaters. On second look, Hermione appeared similarly unaffected. She frowned.

"Ginny," said Charlie, heading for the stairs as well. "Stay here, and don't get into trouble."

She opened her mouth to protest, but then shut it again. Objecting to being treated like a child wasn't going to get her anything, except in trouble with mum once she got home. She waited until Charlie was gone before turning back to the window, finding the latch, and sliding it open. She was in a perfect sniper's position, and took out one Death Eater with a 'stupefy', and distracted another when her 'expelliarmus' missed her intended target by an inch. She was about to pick another one off when the store was hit with another blasting hex and she felt the wall underneath her give out. It was time to find a better hiding place.

She took the stairs at a run, pulling up short when she saw a Death Eater grabbing at a small girl with startling blue eyes. The girl was screaming for her mother, and Ginny cast a Bat-Boogey hex. It had always been her best hex, and she had to say that this one outdid them all, even counting the one she put on Malfoy in her fourth year.

While the Death Eater was rolling on the ground she grabbed the girl by the arm and hustled her away. Outside the Aurors had arrived and the attack was ended as soon as it began. Ginny led the girl a bit away from the shop, snagging a passing Auror to tell him that there was a Death Eater inside. She then turned to the child, who was crying silently.

"Hey there," she said gently, "Are you alright?"

The girl nodded, sniffing slightly.

"What's your name?"

"Laney."

"Hi, Laney. I'm Ginevra. Is your mum here?"

Laney shook her head. "Mum doesn't do magic."

"How about your dad?"

"He's dead," said Laney softly.

"Who are you here with then?"

"My uncle. He told me to stay in the store when he went to stop the bad men."

"I'll help you find him then. What does he look like?"

"He looks like my dad did with white hair, but he has silver eyes."

Ginny was just about to look for an older gentleman when Charlie came up.

"Ginny, you alright? Who's this?"

"This is Laney. We're looking for her uncle."

Just then the Auror brought out the Death Eater that Ginny had hexed. Charlie took one look at the man as the Auror took off the curse, and then turned to Ginny.

"I thought I told you to stay out of trouble." He obviously recognized the Bat-Boogey. It wasn't anyone who could cast that hex with her kind of intensity.

"I did," said Ginny. "He was grabbing at Laney here. What was I supposed to do?"

"You're going to get a letter from the Ministry," said Charlie. "You're not supposed to do magic and besides, what if you had gotten hurt? What would I tell mum?"

Ginny rolled her eyes, and was about to respond when she heard someone calling Laney's name. She looked up to see none other than Draco Malfoy striding over, his face set. She watched in stunned silence as he knelt by the girl, taking her rather roughly by the shoulders and berating her for running off. Laney was crying again, and Draco withdrew slightly.

Ginny was about to step in, to tell him to shove off for scaring Laney like that, but then Laney explained in a trembling voice what had happened, and the grey eyes turned ice cold. So cold that beside her Charlie stiffened and she felt a slight thrill of fear.

Draco turned, his eyes resting on the Death Eater, and the two Weasleys watched in shock as the Slytherin approached the Death Eater. Somehow, the man managed to escape, breaking away from the Auror, but Draco was there. Ginny didn't know how he managed it, but he seemed to grab his arm, twist it behind him, and then kick out the man's knees. The Death Eater fell, but Draco didn't release his arm and there was a sickening crack as the shoulder dislocated. The look on Malfoy's face was deadly and even the Auror did want to interfere.

Laney started crying again; it was no wonder. The girl had just been accosted by Death Eaters, and now her uncle was playing torturer as he stepped on the man's injured shoulder and whispered something in his ear. Whatever it was, it made the Death Eater pale.

Ginny knelt by Laney, gently rubbing her back and turning her slightly away from the scene. When Draco returned, he looked slightly uneasy at the sight of Laney's tears. Ginny gave him her best glare, but he didn't notice. He gathered the girl up and left, nodding once at Ginny and Charlie before moving off.

"Malfoy has a niece?" Charlie asked, staring after the boy.

It was more than that. Draco Malfoy had a half-blood niece because Laney had said that her mother didn't do magic. She had also said that her dad was dead, but that he had looked a lot like Draco. That meant the Slytherin once had an older brother.

She frowned, her thoughts still occupied on the blond even when the Golden Trio returned wearing triumphant smiles. Ron had a bandage on his arm, but other than that, they were unharmed.

"It was totally wicked," Ron was exclaiming to Charlie. "The Death Eaters practically ran from Harry, like they were afraid of him or something."

Ginny didn't really listen, half-heartedly finishing her shopping.

She didn't expect to see Laney again, Malfoy had said that he would take her home, but later in the day she spotted the white-blond and the little girl sitting outside the ice cream parlor. The others were occupied with a window display and so she quickly excused herself and walked across the street.

Draco noticed her coming, his brow furrowing slightly, but his expression remained guarded, closed. Laney noticed her coming and broke into a large smile, waving excitedly. She obviously recovered quickly, and then Ginny saw why. There was a tiny, pure white kitten in her lap, licking at her dish of ice cream, smothered in strawberries, sprinkles and whipped cream.

"Hey Laney," said Ginny, sitting in the chair next to the girl. "Is that your cat?"

Laney nodded enthusiastically. "Uncle Draco bought him for me."

"What's his name?"

"Merlin," said Laney. It was apparent that this was a new development because Draco, who had just taken a bite of his own ice cream, choked slightly. Ginny laughed.

"It's a good name for a pet," she said approvingly. Laney glowed with pleasure. "Did you get all of your school shopping done?" Ginny continued, ignoring Draco's dark look that clearly told her to leave.

"Yup," said Laney. "We got all of Uncle Draco's stuff too. He's Head Boy."

Draco Malfoy, Head Boy. It surprised her, because the Slytherin wasn't exactly the model of good behavior, but then again, she never expected to see him fighting Death Eaters either.

"Congratulations," she said, finally meeting Draco's cold gaze. She smiled a bit, just because it threw him off.

"Don't you have friends to go bother?" he asked, speaking for the first time and his voice practically dripped with disdain and annoyance.

"She's my friend," said Laney. "You're not being nice."

Merlin bless little children and their lack of inhibitions. Ginny had to cover her mouth to hide her smile, and Draco looked surprised, or rather, his eyebrows rose fractionally.

Ginny composed herself, bringing her hand down from her mouth as soon as she could keep a straight face. Malfoy seemed to read the laughter in her eyes because he frowned.

"Actually, I do have to go," said Ginny, twisting back to see that her friends were almost done with the display and she did not want to see their reactions when they found her conversing with the Prince of Slytherin. Actually, seeing as Hermione and Harry didn't seem surprised to see Malfoy fighting Death Eaters probably meant that they wouldn't mind so much, but Ron would pitch a fit.

"It was nice meeting you Laney," said Ginny, smiling at the girl. "I'll see you on the train to Hogwarts then."

She gave the girl a hug, partially because she thought Laney was incredibly sweet, and partially because she knew it would annoy Draco.

"Bye, Nevra," said Laney, who couldn't pronounce her name at all, but she didn't really mind.

"Good-bye," said Ginny, and then she left, reaching her friends just as they turned around.

"D'you wanna go check out the new brooms?" asked Harry to her, grabbing Hermione's hand.

Ginny glanced at Hermione, saw that the seventh year was shaking her head in a silent 'no', and then Ginny remembered her brothers grilling her on her boyfriends and Hermione's silence. She smiled wickedly.

"I would love to," she said.

So, I've finally run out of chapters written ahead of time, so in the next chapter you may see: Draco revealing to Bill that he feels a little off about the whole 'uncle' thing, Draco and Severus meeting to discuss Death Eater things, and Snape's memory of how the faculty reacted to the news that Draco is HeadBoy. OR, it could beSybil Trelawney getting a prediction right, Voldemort doing the electric slide, and a terrible death caused by stampeding owls.

Or it could be both, you never know (lol). Please review!





7. Persian Runes and Potions Masters

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a back ache for sitting against a wall for so long looking over this.

It was Sunday night. Draco was in his living room with Bill, finishing the translations of the fifth Persian Rune.

"I think it's an account of some sort," said Draco, looking over a page he had just translated. "It's describing some war between the Persians and some other wizards, but I can't translate the name."

"I've got a bit about the deaths recorded. 'This the records of fallen'. We're going to have to tighten up on the grammar a little bit."

Draco skimmed over the part he was working on and nodded. "It does seem to be lacking some structure, but maybe the language is just crude like that. I mean, they did make an entire language up. They may have just foregone some of the syntax."

"I don't know," disagreed Bill. "Sometimes the oddest markings are used to denote possession or formal address. We may just be overlooking it."

"Or we may be looking for nothing," said Draco. "Runes aren't known for their elegant sentence structure. Look at the Viking Runes. The verbs are in the front of the sentence followed by the adjectives for the direct object of all things."

"Yes, but the wizard Vikings seem to prove the statement, 'all brawn, no brains'," said Bill. "Seems to me you prove it too, just in the opposite way."

Draco glanced over and frowned at Bill, who had his eyebrows raised.

"You're deliberately baiting me," he said. "Why?"

Bill shrugged. "You seem somewhat subdued," he said.

"Do I," said Draco, not really making it a question.

"Yeah," said Bill. "Anything wrong?"

"No."

"Heard your niece is a sweet girl," said Bill.

Draco looked up at that, frowning slightly. "From who?" he asked.

"Ginny," said Bill. "She said you went all torturer on a Death Eater in front of the girl."

Draco shrugged. "I made a point."

"Obviously a rather harsh one."

"It had to be done." Draco went back to his parchments.

Bill was silent a moment before speaking. "If something is wrong, you can tell me," he said.

"Nothing's wrong," said Draco.

"Alright," said Bill, in a tone that said he was unconvinced but would let it go for now.

There was silence for a bit as they went back to work before Bill spoke again.

"It's just that you haven't done anything Draco-ish," he said.

"I see," said Draco, not really commenting and hoping Bill would just drop the subject. He should have said something because Bill straightened up and pointed a finger at him.

"There," he said. "Right there is what I am talking about. I say 'Draco-ish' and you're supposed to say something cutting about how I'm using your name as an adjective when it's a pronoun and shouldn't I know better because I'm a translator?"

Draco shrugged, knowing that Bill was right, that he had been feeling somewhat… anxious as of late, but he dealt with it the way he dealt with any emotional stress: he ignored it and kept himself busy.

"So me, not being a prat, means that something is wrong," he said.

"Yes!" said Bill. "That's it exactly."

"What if I'm just in a good mood and don't feel like responding with my usual retorts?" he asked, arguing only because admitting anxiety to Bill would mean that he would have to admit it to himself as well.

"When you are in a good mood you're even worse."

Draco didn't respond; it was hard to argue with the truth. He hoped Bill would get the hint that he didn't feel like talking right then.

"You know," said the red-haired man. "Sometimes it helps to talk about things."

"And sometimes you just need to mind your own business," said Draco, his voice going cold with annoyance. He hid a wince. It had come out harsher than he had intended.

There was silence, one of those awkward silences, like when the host and hostess of a dinner party get into a rather public fight. Draco felt a slight clawing of guilt and he glanced at Bill. The ex-Professor was looking down at his papers, and Draco couldn't read his expression. Should he apologize?

The silence dragged on, prompting him to speak.

"I'm sorry," he said quietly.

There was no answer.

Draco risked another look; there was no change.

"There's been…a lot on my mind," he said lamely. "So, sorry."

He glanced up once more to see that Bill was actually smiling at him. He had been faking the entire time.

"Bastard," he muttered, grabbing at his papers in an attempt to avoid more questions, but Bill snatched them out of his hands.

"What's on your mind?" he asked.

"I don't want to talk about it," said Draco.

"I won't stop asking questions until you do," said Bill.

Draco clenched his jaw. What fate did he offend to get such a nosey, stubborn friend?

"It's Laney," he said, practically having to force the words out. "I don't do emotional nonsense."

Bill seemed to understand his cryptic statements. "You're afraid that you're not exactly uncle-type material."

Draco gave a short nod and Bill looked thoughtful for a moment.

"I suppose it's a little weird, suddenly having family when you didn't expect it."

"To say the least."

"I take it that Laney is vastly different then the rest of your family as well. I mean, for one thing she probably isn't emotionally damaged. No offense or anything."

"I'm emotionally damaged?" asked Draco, raising an eyebrow. He wasn't offended, more amused than anything really.

Bill opened his mouth but then shut it again. Draco smirked slightly.

"If I'm emotionally damaged, I won't have any feelings you'll hurt if you say 'yes'," he said.

"Damaged is the wrong word," said Bill. "More like…," he trailed off, obviously not wanting to say something to offend him.

"Emotionally unavailable," supplied Draco. "To an extreme."

Bill shot him a quizzical look and Draco shrugged.

"I psychoanalyzed myself."

"You psychoanalyzed yourself," Bill repeated.

Draco shrugged slightly. "The diagnosis isn't that accurate because I did analyze myself and I no doubt disregarded things that I didn't feel were important or things that I didn't want to admit to myself, but yes. I'm emotionally unavailable, so how am I supposed to cope with being an Uncle?"

"Isn't admitting you have a problem the first step to recovery?"

Draco rolled his eyes.

"I'm serious," said Bill. "You know that you have a tendency to be emotionally distant, so just try to make an effort when dealing with Laney."

"How am I supposed to act around her though?"

"You're thinking too hard about it. Just act naturally."

"You're missing the point, Bill. The point is that when I act naturally, I'm a prat."

"Being an older brother, or an uncle, tends to bring out the best in people. You start realizing that they look up to you and follow your lead, and so you change your behavior accordingly."

"So it's just trial and error," said Draco.

"Mostly," agreed Bill.

Draco gave him an unconvinced look to which Bill grinned.

"You're a genius, Draco. You'll do fine."

He went back to his Runes, which obviously signaled the end of the conversation. Draco glowered slightly, because talking with Bill really hadn't made him feel better, and turned back to his own paper as well, reading over what he had translated. Some would find it strange that he had to re-read what he had already written down, but when he wrote it, he was more concerned about the translation and so the content of the message never really registered.

The passage went on to describe the war, and there was some interesting information on a ritual the wizards used that caused temporary darkness.

"Hey, Bill, listen to this," he said suddenly, spotting something of extreme interest. "The potion…well, I think this word means something like altered, or changed, but I can't quite tell in the context, but anyway, it says 'the potion – altered, or whatever – the drink responsible for the loosened lips'."

"Loosened tips?" asked Bill. "Doesn't that usually refer to alcohol? So what is that? A hangover potion?"

"No," said Draco shaking his head. "A loose tongue is used to describe the effects of alcohol. Loosened lips is something different. Here, it goes on. 'The compulsion was ended, choice regained. If spoken, the truth was spoken, but silence was…' I think that word means allowed."

"So, what are you saying?" asked Bill.

"I think it refers to Veritaserum," said Draco. "The drink responsible for the loosened lips."

"And this potion counters the Veritaserum?" asked Bill.

"No. It alters it. I think it's saying that this potion allows someone not to answer."

Bill looked confused so Draco explained.

"The main effect of Veritaserum is truth telling, however, there's another part, compulsion."

"Compulsion?" asked Bill.

"Yeah. Look, when you give someone Veritaserum and ask them a question, what do they do?"

"Tell the truth," said Bill.

"Yes," said Draco, "but they do something else too that you're missing. Look, ask me a question. Any question."

"Alright," said Bill. "What's your favorite color?"

Draco didn't answer. After a moment he raised his eyebrow.

"You see?" he asked.

"You didn't answer," said Bill.

"Exactly," said Draco. "See, the first thing Veritaserum does is make the person talk. The second thing is it makes the person speak the truth. I think that this passage refers to a counter to Veritaserum that effects the compulsion part of the serum. Basically, it allows the person to keep their mouth shut, to choose if they want to answer or not."

"This could be big," said Bill. "If you're right about it, that is."

Draco smirked. "When am I wrong?" he asked. He ignored Bill's snort. "There's a list of potion ingredients further down. I haven't translated them yet because names are always a pain to translate, even the names of plants. This might take me awhile."

"How long is awhile?" asked Bill.

"Well, I've got nothing to do all week except pack up for school, and that won't take me long, so I'll know how long by then."

"Last year of school," said Bill. "Are you excited?"

Draco snorted, twirling his quill around his fingers. "Thrilled," he said, his voice so dry that a giant could pick up on the sarcasm.

"Oh, come on," said Bill. "You're Head Boy."

"Against my wishes."

"It won't be that bad."

"I told the Dark Lord to sod off and got disowned. Of course, the Slytherins will know that, and will be looking for ways to off me, but meanwhile all news of my disownment will be kept quiet until the actually official date. So, all of the teachers and students will still think I'm a Death Eater in training except those who have it in for me. On top of that, I've got a bloody niece that I have to look out for."

"You could just join the Order," said Bill. "I know you don't want to, but we would be able to help you with the other students and what not."

Draco shook his head; he wasn't ready for the Order just yet.

"Take it one day at a time," said Bill. "And Dumbledore will be looking out for you as well, if only to make sure that you don't cheat at anymore Quidditch games."

Draco felt his lips quirk up slightly, so he changed it into a smirk. "I don't know. He hasn't noticed the past three times. I don't think this year will be any different."

Bill laughed, and turned back to his papers.

"You know," he said. "You don't have to teach me this to use as a code for the Ministry. We could use another code if you wanted to publish this. I mean, this is the greatest translational job of the decade. You could write books and what not."

"It's been untranslated for centuries now," Draco responded. "Another few months isn't going to hurt. Besides, you'll be coming back in December."

Bill frowned. "How did you know that?" he asked.

"Fleur's part Veela," said Draco. "That means her gestation period is shorter than most females lasting from five to six months as opposed to the normal nine. There's no way you would miss the birth of your child, so I figured you would come back."

"You are probably the only seventeen year old boy that would know that," said Bill, shaking his head.

"I was probably the only seven year old that knew that," said Draco.

"Seven?" asked Bill, raising his eyebrows.

"That whole walking in on my mother and 'Cousin Richard' prompted a rather large research session on the reproductive systems," said Draco, shrugging slightly.

"So, you never got The Talk?" asked Bill.

Draco was silent a moment, but then went ahead. "Pansy visited over the summer when I was fifteen," he said. "Lucius walked in on us when we were becoming rather involved in our romantic activities."

Bill went red for him, and Draco laughed lightly. "It was nothing really bad," he said. "I had my shirt off and Pansy was lying on the couch, but the way my father stared, you would have thought we were actually doing it. Anyway, after she left, he sat me down in his study all serious and he tries to tell me about sex and what not, but he couldn't get the words out. It was the closest I have ever seen him come to stuttering. I let him struggle for a while, before finally owning up that I already knew everything."

"What happened then?" asked Bill, genuinely interested in the story. Draco knew that it was partially because Bill cared about him, but partly because the idea of Lucius as a father was new to him.

"He asked me if I knew because someone told me or if I had first hand experience. I told him both."

"I bet he just loved that," said Bill.

"He seemed," Draco hesitated, "disappointed. As if he finally realized that I had grown up and he had missed it, but the next day, he was gone again on another trip."

Draco realized that he had gone nostalgic and shook it off. "Anyway," he said, ignoring Bill's searching gaze. "Let's get back to work."

There was silence for a few more minutes and then Bill spoke up.

"So, what is your favorite color?"

Severus Snape made his way through the empty halls of Hogwarts. He liked the halls like this, without the frantic children running to classes or hexing each other on the way to lunch. Summer was his time, staying at the castle and brewing in the dungeons without interruption. Well, without as many interruptions. With Albus as Headmaster, Severus was pulled out of the labs at least once a week to dine with the various members of the faculty who had returned to set up their rooms or to drop off a few school supplies.

Now, there was this. Draco Malfoy. Albus had told him that, in exchange for Draco getting Harry out of his relative's house, he was supposed to answer the boy's questions about the Dark Lord's dealings.

Severus was not impressed that the boy had asked for information in exchange for his actions. The boy was Slytherin to the core, and he had expected Draco Malfoy to do something of the sort, after all, the boy was going up against the most powerful dark wizard, and he would need all the help he could get. Or rather, all of the help he would deign to receive, because the boy was also a Malfoy.

Severus approached the gargoyle guarding the entrance of the Headmaster's office and before he had even opened his mouth, the door opened, which only seemed to confirm the rumor that the Headmaster was partly omnipotent.

His lips curled upwards ever-so-slightly when he remembered what Draco Malfoy had said when confronted with that rumor.

"I'm serious," said Eugene Rasport, his dark eyes glittering. "He knows everything that is going on in the school, so watch out for him. He favors the mudbloods."

The fifth year Prefect led the first years down to the dungeon common room where Severus waited to welcome the new students.

"How can he know everything that's going on in the school?" asked Theodore Nott, scowling unpleasantly.

Eugene shrugged slightly and turned to Nott, the shadows caused by the torches flickering across his face and making his smile look positively predatory.

"He just does," he said, his voice a rasping whisper. "He's partially omniscient, so watch yourselves."

It was his intent to frighten the first years, and he succeeded until a young, cold voice spoke up.

"That's just ridiculous."

Severus raised his eyebrow as a small child with hair as pale as his white skin stepped forward, his grey eyes latching onto Eugene's face while a sneer hovered at his colorless lips. So, this was Lucius Malfoy's child. He had seen the boy at the feast, of course, and had seen how quickly the boy had been placed in Slytherin. He suppressed a smile as he watched Eugene gaped at the child before finding his voice.

"And what do you know about it, firstie?" he challenged.

Draco Malfoy shrugged thin shoulders. "Well, he can't be partially omniscient. That's a paradoxical statement." The lips smirked slightly then, and the grey eyes swept to Severus.

Severus inclined his head. "Five points to Slytherin, Mr. Malfoy, for correctly spotting the flaw."

And such had begun his era of giving points to the boy for anything he did, and everyone merely assumed that Severus liked the boy. Of course, this year he wouldn't be able to give the boy a thing. No doubt the Dark Lord would hear of it if he did, and Severus still had a reputation to maintain.

Albus was doing the right thing, giving Draco the Head Boy position. This way he could at least retaliate against his aggressors without breaking school rules. The rest of the faculty was not as thrilled as Severus was. He ascended the stairs to the Headmaster's office, remembering the meeting that had taken place.

The conference room was full. Snape hunched in his seat, grimacing as he listened to all of the inane conversations around him and hoping that Albus would get there soon else he might just walk out. He was in the process of experimenting with a cure for Lycanthropy and he believed he was on to something.

"Ahh, my apologies," said the Headmaster, sweeping into the room wearing a robe of a particularly cheerful shade of blue. Of course, the suns and clouds sewn onto the surface may have been responsible for the happy look.

And speaking of happy, Dumbledore's eyes were not just twinkling today, they were practically shining. Severus wondered what had happened and then decided that he probably didn't want to know.

Severus waited as Dumbledore sat at the head of the table and then twinkled obnoxiously at all of them.

"Some sad news," he said. "Bertha Hedwick will not be attending Hogwarts this year."

The faculty breathed a collective sigh of relief.

"Thank Merlin," muttered McGonagall.

"She would have been worse than Longbottom," said Sinistra. "How did her uncle pass away? Wasn't it drowning in a rainstorm?"

"No, that was her great aunt," said Sprout. "He was killed by stampeding owls."

"That's right," said Flitwick. "I never did understand how that happened."

"We aren't supposed to," said McGonagall. "It's called bad luck for a reason."

"Ah, yes," said Sybil in a misty voice with wide eyes. "We all must remember not to offend the Fates-,"

"Or break powerful magical mirrors," said McGonagall, interrupting her with undisguised disdain. "After all, that is what caused this whole thing to begin in the first place."

"Seven generations of bad luck," said Sprout. "Horrid."

"But not as bad as what I saw in my crystal ball this morning," said Trelawny in a hushed whisper, glaring at McGonagall. "You will receive unwelcome information in your near future, Minerva."

"Ahem," said Dumbledore, halting what might have been a full out cat fight. "On a happier note, Remus Lupin has once again agreed to be our Defense teacher."

All of the teacher's brightened up considerably. Severus scowled, once again being denied the DADA position.

"I suppose this means I must make the mutt his potion again, Albus?" he asked, shooting a dark look at the Headmaster. "On top of everything else?"

Dumbledore looked suitably regretful, and Minerva sent him a sympathetic look, which mollified him somewhat.

"I am sorry to add more to your plate, Severus," said Dumbledore. "But I have no doubt that several seventh year students would be willing to help you with the Wolfsbane and will only require the slightest of supervisions."

"Very well," said Severus, still irritated and not bothering to hide it.

"And speaking of seventh years," said Dumbledore, twinkling wildly. "That brings me to the next order of business: our Head Students. Head Girl will go to Hermione Granger."

No one looked surprised, but they did look pleased. She would no doubt be the best Head Girl Hogwarts had ever seen.

"And, after much deliberation, Head Boy will go to Draco Malfoy."

Silence.

Dead silence.

"What?"

That was Minerva, her face turning an alarming shade of fuchsia. Severus looked at Dumbledore who looked as if he had been dreading this conversation.

"Now, Minerva," he began, trying desperately to sooth the Gryffindor. McGonagall was not to be calmed.

"Don't you 'now, Minerva' me, Albus," she said. "What, in Merlin's name, possessed you to pick Draco Malfoy as Head Boy?"

By the way her lips were pursed together and by the unyielding look in her eye, Severus knew that Dumbledore was in for an earful if he didn't have a good reason.

"I believe that Draco Malfoy would greatly benefit from a little bit of trust from the faculty-," he started, but Minerva once again interrupted.

"Albus, you cannot save everyone. If given position as Head Boy, Malfoy will be unmanageable. Need I remind you of the countless fights the boy has either instigated or participated in? Or the way he continually bullies the younger students? Or how he goes into periods of tempers where he destroys classrooms?"

Sprout and Flitwick were nodding as well, looking more mutinous than Severus had ever seen. Trelawny looked quite indignant as well, and only Professor Vector looked somewhat undisturbed.

"I realize that he doesn't have the best track record," tried Dumbledore. He was once again silenced.

"His father is a Death Eater, and it is safe to assume that Mr. Malfoy will follow in his father's footsteps, if he hasn't already. That is the last thing that this school needs."

"The school needs to be unified," said Dumbledore, his eyes losing somewhat of their sparkle and gaining a harder look. Severus doubted any of the other teachers noticed, but he knew that the Headmaster wasn't going to take any more complaints much longer. "Now, because I realize that you have some legitimate causes for worry, I will be keeping a close eye on the boy. If he proves that he is not up to the task, I will remove him, but until then, as Headmaster of this school, he is my choice. You will find I am rarely wrong on my selection of Head students."

McGonagall was not going to let it go without a fight. "Albus, you cannot save every student that comes to this school. They make their own choices as well, and sometimes they are just too far gone."

Severus spoke up for the first time, deciding that while it was fun to see Minerva so upset, he really did want the meeting to end sometime today, even if he had to play the pity card.

"Too far gone, Minerva?" he asked quietly. "How far gone is not worth it anymore?"

He looked up, the unspoken question in his black eyes. 'Was I too far gone to be not worth the effort?' McGonagall's face softened. The Gryffindors, for all of their bravery, were far too easily swayed by sympathy. Sprout and Flitwick looked enraged that their hardened leader against the case of Draco Malfoy was gone, but they were too spineless to say anything themselves.

Dumbledore broke the silence.

"Well, now that we have that settled…,"

Severus inwardly sighed. Would this never end? As he braced himself for more inane chatter, he realized that Sybil Trelawny had indeed been right. McGonagall had received unwelcome news.

Severus brought himself out of his reverie as he reached the Headmasters office and knocked.

"Come in," called Dumbledore and he opened the door to see the Headmaster sitting behind his desk with a very Muggle-looking Draco Malfoy in one of the chintz armchairs.

Severus raised an eyebrow at Draco's choice of clothing, and the hideous green jacket, and Draco smirked ever-so-slightly.

"Lemon drop, Severus?" asked Dumbledore.

"No," said Severus, and he sat in the other chair.

"Well, then," said Dumbledore brightly. "What is it you wish to know, Draco?"

Draco turned to Severus. "Are the Death Eaters after Laney?"

Severus frowned. "Who?"

"Laney," said Draco coolly, as if he had just been lied to. "Delaney Chalmers-Malfoy."

"A Malfoy?" he asked.

"My niece," said Draco.

"You have a niece?" It took a minute for it to sink in. "Lucius has another child?"

"Had," said Draco shortly. "Lukas. Illegitimate son of Lucius Malfoy and Rosemary Eddington, of the French Eddingtons. He was killed ten years ago and Delaney is the result of his marriage to a Muggle woman."

It was all he could do not to gape. "I see," he managed. "And you think Death Eaters are after your niece?"

"The attack at Diagon Alley. I was under the impression that Drew Winton was targeting her."

Ahh. That would explain it. Draco seemed to read the understanding in his eyes because he raised his eyebrow.

"The attack on Diagon Alley was not planned ahead of time," Severus explained. "That was why the Aurors were not on the scene earlier because I was unable to inform the Headmaster. I knew that there was a reason to the attack, but the Dark Lord merely explained it as showing his strength."

"So the Dark Lord knows that Lucius has a half-blood grand-daughter," said Draco.

"It would appear that way, yes," said Severus. "There is little that Lucius does not tell him. Most likely they were trying to get rid of the evidence that the Malfoy line had entangled itself with Muggles. Drew Winton is known for his unquestioning obedience and I believe it is safe to say he was told to target your niece."

"How did they know where we were?"

Severus shrugged. "Lucius has a formidable amount of spies, as does the Dark Lord. They probably waited until an opportunity presented itself where they could wipe out the blemish on the line without raising suspicion."

Draco nodded in such a way that Severus knew he had already drawn the same conclusions, but was looking for more confirmation.

"How many Horcruxes have been destroyed?"

Severus blinked at that, not only because of the abrupt change of topic, but because he hadn't known that Draco knew about the Horcruxes. Dumbledore looked equally surprised.

"What do you know of them?" asked the Headmaster, peering curiously at Draco.

"Not much," said Draco. "I know that last year the Dark Lord regained a Horcrux from Nagini and that the Horcrux in the trophy was destroyed, but I don't have a count."

"We believe there is seven in total. There was a diary of Tom Riddle that was destroyed in your second year by Harry," said Dumbledore, watching Draco carefully. Severus did as well, but Draco only frowned slightly.

"A diary?" he asked. "Are you sure it was his?"

He obviously had nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets and Severus was willing to bet that he had no idea that Lucius had played a key role in releasing the basilisk.

"Quite," said Dumbledore, "and there was a ring that I discovered last year and destroyed. It once belonged to Tom's uncle, but that is all I will reveal at this moment as the information is quite confidential. Not even all of the members of the Order are aware of the Horcruxes."

Draco nodded before turning to Severus again. "Why was the Dark Lord mad at Aunt Bella?" he asked.

"Where did you hear that from?" asked Severus.

"Around," said Draco, shrugging slightly.

That meant he wasn't going to tell, so Severus answered. "I don't know," he said honestly, "and none of the Death Eaters seem to know either, except for the inner circle, but they aren't speaking."

Draco frowned slightly, his brow furrowing. He was obviously trying to work out what it might mean.

"Is he planning anything big that I should be informed of?"

Severus shook his head. "Right now there doesn't seem to be an attack brewing, but he has sent out a lot of spies. When they return, we'll know what they found out, but for now, we're just trying to figure out where they went. Anything else?"

"Not now," said Draco, looking up at him. "Though I may have to ask you some questions later." He turned to Dumbledore now. "If that is alright?"

"As long as you share any conclusions you come up with," said Dumbledore. "Your insight could be quite beneficial."

Severus saw Draco hesitate slightly. He knew the boy wasn't quite up to choosing sides just yet, and sharing his thoughts with the Order would be more than just rescuing Potter as a one time favor. It would be a working relationship.

Taking advantage of Draco's distraction, Severus reached out with Legilimency, carefully pushing past half-erected mind shields and delving into the former heir's mind. The vision came and it was all he could do not to jerk in surprise at the sight of Voldemort breaking into a large dance number, backed by his masked followers. It took only a moment to identify the dance as the Electric Slide.

Snape withdrew, impressed and justly rebuked at the intrusion. He also knew that Draco wasn't angry at his attempt at mind-reading. It was apparent from the false memories and decoy shields that the boy could have thrown him out much more forcefully, and painfully.

"Okay," said Draco finally, not at all perturbed by Snape trying Legilimency.

"Excellent," said Dumbledore, looking quite pleased with Draco's answer.

Severus knew that this was Dumbledore's way of hedging Draco into joining the Order. It was motivated by genuine concern, but some of Dumbledore's reasons were not altruistic. He would always put the good of the majority of the minority, even if that meant using manipulation. He wondered if Draco knew that, but one look at the wariness in the grey eyes made him positive that the boy was quite aware of it. Lucius, after all, was quite the master chess player, and he was not speaking about on the board.

"Well, then," said Draco, standing up and taking back control of the meeting, a subtle message to Dumbledore that he was no one's pawn. "I need to be getting back. Good day."

Severus sat back, watching Draco as he Flooed out of the office. This would be interesting.

The Hogwarts Express: train, full of students piling on from the Platform. Parents: kissing their kids good-bye, helping them shove trunks on board. Friends: shouting to each other, running through the throng, squealing.

Draco pushed his way through the crowd, deftly avoiding the sharp elbows, although even he couldn't avoid all of the jostling. He had already put his things on board in the Head Student and Prefect compartment, helped a few first years board (as his badge demanded) and now he was searching for his niece.

He took a moment to stare back at the train. It was hard to believe that only one year ago he was hiding in a compartment, burning the Malfoy Code, and trying to think of how he would get out of taking the Dark Mark. Now, he was a rogue player who had denied the Dark Lord to his face.

"Uncle Draco!"

He turned to see Laney waving excitedly, her mother gripping tightly onto her hand, and although Laney was the one leaving home, Samantha seemed to be the one who was nervous. Laney looked incredibly cheerful, as usual.

He forced his way to them, Laney running up to hug him about the waist to which he stiffened slightly but then petted her dark hair. She pulled back to look up at him with wide eyes.

"Is this the Hogwarts Express?" she asked.

"It is indeed," he told her.

"It looks just like Hogwarts: A History said it would," said Laney.

Draco smirked slightly, glad that he had sent her the book, even if she did sound like Granger.

The whistle blew, and Laney gave her mother one last squeeze.

"Take care of her," said Samantha to him.

"I will," Draco promised, and then the Muggle woman reached out and pulled him into a hug as well, pressing her lips to his cheek.

"You take care of yourself as well," she ordered. "And come over during the Christmas break."

"Yes, ma'am," said Draco.

"Good. Now go before you miss the train. And Laney, I expect owls."

"Yes, Mum," Laney promised, giving her mother one last hug good-bye and then grabbing Draco's hand and pulling him towards the Express.

He levitated her trunk on board while she watched with wide eyes. He already knew what compartment she was going to be in, the third on the left in the fifth car that already held two girls and another boy. It was no coincidence that those children had been the students that Draco had helped sit. They were all first years, two half-bloods, one Muggle-born. All three had siblings in Hogwarts and he had checked up on them and their families, accessing the school records and anything the Ministry had on them. It was illegal and slightly difficult as he had to forge several documents, but Laney was his niece, and he wanted to make sure that she had the right friends.

He opened the door and they all looked up with terrified expression. He said nothing, not wanting to spoil Laney's chances. He merely put her trunk away and ushered her in. He gave her a quick half-smile before shutting the door.

The train blew its last whistle, and then started, slowly at first but building speed. Draco looked out of the door window at all of the parents waving good-bye, feeling a slight pang that might have resembled sorrow if he had actually cared to register it. While Lucius was not around all of the time, he always had breakfast with Draco on the day of his departure. Draco missed it.

He shook away the nostalgia and made his way to the front of the train, stepping into the compartment that was housing the seventh year Prefects and Heads. It was a larger partition, to seat everyone, and the seats were actual comfortable chairs and not benches. Being a Prefect or Head Student really paid off.

Draco entered and everyone turned to gape at him.

"You?" demanded Ron Weasley. "You're Head Boy?"

"I'm quite surprised myself actually," said Draco, turning a sneer in his direction. "I was thinking that this school was beyond all help, but when I got my badge I realized that perhaps there was hope left after all."

His gaze swept the room, taking in everyone and any possible threat in a split second. Weasley and Potter were the Gryffindor Prefects. While normally the Prefects were boy and girl, because Granger had been promoted, the open Prefect spot was available to the next applicable candidate in the Gryffindor house. The Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff Prefects were sitting in the back together and the Slytherins were grouped in the corner. They were Theodore Nott and Pansy Parkinson, an interesting choice for Prefect because they both came from Death Eater families and because Nott had been initiated last summer.

Although some might have thought Dumbledore mad for choosing those particular students, Draco could see the logic behind it all. By giving the two students a position of power, it compelled them to abide by the rules if they wished to maintain that authority. It also allowed the professors to be doubly hard on them because they were supposed to be examples for the other students.

Draco sat in the empty seat that was between Potter and Pansy, the black haired boy giving him an odd look, and the girl giving him a disdainful sniff.

Silence fell over the small room, a silence that made everyone uncomfortable but him. He dug around in the school bad he had brought with him and pulled out a book dedicated to the theory behind complex Transfigurations. Beside him, the Golden Trio started up a quiet conversation which prompted the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws to re-start their own discussion.

Draco half-paid attention to the book, keeping an eye out on the two Slytherins. He knew that while his disownment was being kept a secret until the official date, it would not stop the Dark Lord from giving his followers instructions to go after him. So far Nott kept glaring at him and Pansy was ignoring him.

"Is not!" a Ravenclaw exclaimed. The Golden Trio's conversation had been put on hold so that Weasley could join in with the debate between the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs about Quidditch players.

Draco could see Potter listening in rather intently, though he couldn't add to either side seeing as he had been locked in his room the entire summer. Hermione was rolling her eyes at all of them.

"Jameson is not as good as Henwick," said Weasley heatedly. "Sure, he can fly fast, but so can anyone on a Meteor."

"But he has some amazing moves," countered the Ravenclaw by the name of Pierce Rogers.

"But he has no consistency!" Weasley argued.

Draco had the urge to point out the Weasel's own failings in that regard, but he remembered a second later that he couldn't really afford to keep up his feud with Ron, no matter how much he detested the boy. He settled for smirking, which no one saw, and turned the page in his book.

The compartment door opened, but Draco didn't bother looking up, not until a voice said "Uncle Draco?"

Every head in the room shot up, eyes going to the small girl in the doorway and then to each other in shock.

"Yes, Laney?" asked Draco calmly, closing his book.

"Buy me some candy," Laney all but ordered, but then she tempered it with, "Please?" and a bright, winning smile.

He couldn't say no, knew he wouldn't be able to say 'no' to her the moment he saw her. So he got up and walked over to her, and she latched onto his hand, sending the occupants of the car into a second state of shock.

She practically dragged him down the corridor to the trolley, and started picking through the candy cart with her three new friends. He only bought a few things for her, making sure that she wasn't going to get sick on all of the sweets. She thanked him with a hug and a kiss that made his lips twitch, and then he made sure that she was settled back into her compartment before making his way back to his own seat.

Nott was waiting for him outside the Prefect's compartment, arms crossed. It was an intimidating stance, especially because the Slytherin was beefy and muscled, but crossing the arms did not leave for an unhampered reach for the wand, if need be. A more threatening, and more practical stance would be letting the wand arm hang loose, fingers twitching slightly, as if aching to draw it.

Draco ignored Nott, starting to brush past him and re-enter the car, but Nott surprised him. He hadn't thought that the boy would initiate physical contact, but he was wrong. The seventh year had become daring with his Dark Mark, empowered by his allegiance with the Dark Lord. Nott's hand snagged his shirt collar before he could reach for the door handle, and then he was shoved backwards into the opposite wall, the back of his head smashing painfully into the wood paneling.

"You're not untouchable anymore, Malfoy," Nott snarled. "Or, should I say, traitor?" He annunciated the last word with a shove. "So, that was your little Half-Blood niece, wasn't it?"

Nott thrived off of fear, and so Draco turned bored grey eyes onto the larger student.

"Do you mind, Nott?" he asked lightly. "You're wrinkling my shirt."

Nott's expression turned dirty. "You don't seem to understand," he hissed. "We who are loyal to the Dark Lord have free reign over you. One does not deny the Dark Lord to his face."

"Funny," Draco retorted, with the same unconcerned tone, "I thought I had just done that."

Nott shoved him further into the wall. "One does not deny the Dark Lord to his face without facing the consequences. He has specifically said that we are to punish you, punish you without killing you that is."

"Rather kind of him," said Draco.

"He wants that honor himself," Nott revealed. "And he will have it. You aren't safe, Malfoy, not even in your cozy Head Boy position."

"No doubt you'll be playing delivery boy then?" asked Draco, wondering if it was Nott's job to lure him into the Dark Lord's grasp.

Nott answered, which Draco was hoping he would.

"The Dark Lord is going to pay all of the traitors and Mud-bloods a little visit himself, so watch your back Malfoy, watch yours and that little Half-Blooded niece of yours."

Draco didn't say anything, instead he sprang into action. He grabbed Nott's shirt collar and pulled down, forcing the boy to bend slightly and then jerking his knee up and into the boy's gut. Nott's stumbled back, the air whooshing out of his lungs and Draco took that opportunity to twist him around by the arm and slam him up against the wall.

The Prefect door burst open and Potter and Granger hurried out, pulling up short at the sight of him. They had obviously heard the large thump Nott's large body had caused upon hitting the wall.

"Everything alright over here?" asked Potter, concern in his eyes.

Draco was a little startled to see the concern directed at him, but he nodded, shooting the boy-hero a significant look.

"Quite fine," he said. "Theodore and I are just having a little chat, isn't that right, Theo?"

He gave Nott's arm a jerk upwards, causing the boy to grunt out a 'Yes'. Granger looked shocked at the display, but Potter nodded.

"Alright then," he said, and guided his girlfriend back inside, even though Hermione looked like she was loathed to leave the scene without the proper disciplinary action.

"Now, listen to me, Nott," said Draco, his voice going dark. "If you even dare to look at my niece, I will gouge out your eyes. If you place a hand on my niece, I will cut off your arms. If you raise your wand to my niece, well, I'll break both of yours." He paused, making sure that the innuendo was understood. "Now, I want you to inform the rest of your Death Eater friends of that, understood?"

Nott didn't answer so Draco took the time to smash Nott's nose into the wood wall. The bone broke, blood spurted everywhere.

"Understood?" he asked, his voice like granite.

"Yed," Nott managed, the broken nose making speech difficult.

"Good," said Draco. "Go tell them now."

He released the boy, who staggered slightly, hand going to his nose. Nott's expression was deadly, but the anger was directed at him, and not Laney. Draco wanted it to stay that way. Draco watched until Nott stumbled down the corridor and into another compartment and then released a breath, trying to calm his tensed nerves.

Draco re-entered the compartment and sat back down in his seat, hoping to have the rest of the ride to Hogwarts undisturbed. Twenty minutes later and the door burst in and an irate Blaise Zabini strode across the small room and pulled the book from his hands.

"Well?" he demanded.

"Well what?" asked Draco, completely mystified.

"You told me at the end of the year to ask you the day after graduation if we could be friends. Of course, I was assuming that I could get into contact with you after graduation. I tried owling the Manor a few times, but I receive no reply and then all of the rumors are going around Slytherin about how you're dis-," Blaise broke off as Draco jerked his head sharply.

"Oh," said Blaise, then "Ohhh!" He considered that for a few seconds and then, "Seriously? Is it because of what they are saying you did?"

Draco could see Potter looking at him, clearly being able to follow the conversation because of his visions, and Hermione looked as if she was trying to put together the pieces. Draco knew she would have most of it figured out in a few days or so. She was a smart girl. Weasley, however, was a different story. He was glaring at Draco, distrust and hate in his eyes.

"Anyway," said Blaise, "I didn't even know you were back until Nott went barging into the other Slytherin compartment, you know the one with all the Death Eaters, because you broke his nose. What about by the way?"

Potter raised his eyebrows at him, Granger looked horrified, and Weasley still glared.

"Things," said Draco vaguely.

"So?" asked Blaise, looking at him expectantly.

"So what?" asked Draco, not following Blaise's line of thinking at all.

"So are we friends or not?"

"Oh," said Draco. "Yeah, I'm safe."

Blaise grinned as if genuinely pleased at that answer, and Draco suspected he was, so he let his lips twitch up in response. He was suddenly was sick of the Golden Trio's staring and stood.

"Do you want to meet Laney?" he asked.

"Who's Laney?" asked Blaise. "New girlfriend?"

"No," said Draco, walking to the door. "She's my niece."

"Your what? Whoa," said Blaise. "You're gonna have to explain this one to me."

So Draco did, knowing that as a fellow, high-society Pureblood Blaise would understand the intricate workings of scandal and be properly discrete about the information. He then knocked on the compartment door and swung it open. Laney was chatting away with her friends, playing exploding snap and eating candy, but she immediately looked up when the door opened and grinned.

"Hey, Uncle Draco!" she said.

"Uncle Draco?" asked Blaise turning to him and snickering. Draco ignored him.

"Laney, this is Blaise, one of my good friends."

Laney stood and stuck out her hand, which Blaise shook with a serious face.

"Very pleased to meet you," he said. "And I'm even more pleased that you don't look like an albino like your Uncle."

Laney burst into giggles, which made Draco glad that he had introduced them, even if he had a feeling that he was going to be the butt of a lot of Blaise's jokes. Taking the advantage of Laney's distraction, he checked the room, making sure that everything was running smoothly, but the other three occupants looked happy enough. He turned back to Laney.

"But you do have his pale skin, even with the freckles," Blaise was saying. "I'll just have to call you mini-Malfoy."

Laney laughed again, obviously pleased with the name and Draco smiled, ever-so-slightly. Laney had another friend, and another ally.

"She's a sweet kid," said Blaise, once he and Draco were back in the halls. "Hard to imagine her being related to you."

"Don't I know it," said Draco.

"So, a brother then," said Blaise, looking at him speculatively. "I trust that the knowledge of a bastard Malfoy and a Half-Blood might shock the wizarding world and that said Half-Blood might be in quite a bit of danger?"

"She'll be safer once we're at Hogwarts," said Draco.

"You sure about that?" asked Blaise.

"Yes," said Draco, already having things figured out in his head. "Yes, she will."

They reached Hogwarts sometime later, and Draco made sure that Laney was safely away on the boats with the rest of the first years before climbing onto his own transportation.

Hogwarts hadn't changed a bit, except for the fact that a certain red-haired Professor was absent from the Head Table, and Draco felt a pang of regret that Bill was not there. He would have felt better knowing that he had one ally on the teaching staff, though he supposed Dumbledore and Snape would be looking out for him. Still, it wasn't the same. Bill was, well, like a brother, even as much as admitting that sentiment went against his independent, solitary ways.

He sat with Blaise at the end of the Slytherin table, and he knew that his position there was noticed by everyone at the school. He had on his Ice Prince mask though, so most of them dismissed the notion that perhaps he was no longer acknowledged leader of Slytherin. Besides, he knew the truth. Slytherin followed the most powerful, and if he was given the chance to prove it, he would still have sway over them.

"Hey, Lupin's back!" said Blaise, nudging Draco and nodding towards the Head Table. Sure enough, the werewolf was at the Head Table, between Dumbledore and Severus, the latter looking most put out at the seating arrangement.

Once the students were settled in, Dumbledore rose and quieted them all.

"Attention please, students," he said. The words were unnecessary, because as soon as he stood the hall fell silent. "We will now be sorting the first year students, so please welcome in your new housemates."

The conversation started up again, even ass McGonagall led in the first years. Draco had only one focus, a small girl with almost-black hair and freckles and bright blue eyes. It was the first year where he didn't pay attention to what the Sorting Hat was saying, and then the sorting had begun.

Evelyn Brighton, or Evie as she was nicknamed, went into Gryffindor, as did Kenneth Dredding. Draco knew they would go into Gryffindor, having worked out the statistics of previous relatives and their own placements.

The hall went silent when McGonagall read out "Chalmers-Malfoy, Delaney," stuttering over the 'Malfoy' part. All eyes went to Draco, who was watching his niece. She bounded up to the stool and sat, putting the hat on. Draco knew it would take a few seconds for the hat to decide, but those few seconds felt like eternity, and then the Hat called out

"GRYFFINDOR!"

The hall went dead silent, Draco was so relieved that he couldn't even bring his hands together until beside him Blaise stuck his fingers in his mouth and gave a whistle.

"You go, mini-Malfoy!" he called out, and then Draco remembered to applaud.

Slowly, the applause caught on and Laney pulled off the hat, leaving it on the stool and giving a wave to Draco before joining Evie and Kenneth at the Gryffindor table, and Draco smirked ever-so-slightly. He had put her in that compartment for a reason.

The other girl that was in the compartment with the three, Charity Hendersen, went into Ravenclaw, which Draco had figured she would. He wanted his little niece to have good inter-house relations as well as a good support base in her own home.

"Why do you look so smug?" Blaise asked, catching the look on his face.

"No reason," said Draco, shrugging. "Just, those three first years that were in the compartment with Laney? I helped all of them put their trunks away."

Blaise was in Slytherin for a reason, and so he figured it out. "You sat all of them together so that Laney could have some non-Death Eater friends," he said.

"Yeah," said Draco. "And I knew that Laney would go to Gryffindor, and I knew that at least one of them would make it there as well."

"How did you know that?" asked Blaise.

"Family placings," said Draco. "Did you know that if an older sibling is placed into Ravenclaw, their younger siblings have a seventy percent chance of being put in Gryffindor? See, the parents of Ravenclaws are generally Ravenclaws themselves and have a good work ethic, are logical, and they generally raise their children with strong morals. Their first child ends up in Ravenclaw ninety percent of the time, but the younger siblings want to distinguish themselves from their older siblings by going a different route, in other words, they won't try on school work as much. However, they still have a strong moral base, and they usually end up in Gryffindor."

"You're shitting me," said Blaise, staring at him incredulously. "You've got to be shitting me."

Draco smirked, resisted the urge to grin, and directed his attention to Dumbledore who was standing once more.

"Welcome, returning students and first years, to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At this time, before the feast, I would like you all to welcome our returning Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Remus Lupin."

The Great Hall burst into cheers, the Slytherin table opting to forego on the applause, though Blaise clapped enthusiastically and Draco applauded politely as well. The werewolf was a decent teacher.

"And," said Dumbledore, quieting them down, "it is my pleasure to introduce our Head Girl, Miss Hermione Granger and Head Boy, Mr. Draco Malfoy."

Again, the Slytherin table didn't cheer, but no one really noticed, seeing as the Gryffindor table was cheering so loud nothing else was audible. The food appeared on the table then, and everyone dug in, the loud cheers dying out as the hungry students stuffed their faces. Draco merely picked at his food, too busy watching the Slytherins and his niece to eat more, even though Blaise tried to distract him.

"Head Boy means private dorms, right?" he asked. "That will be nice, getting away from them for the night?" said Blaise, jerking his head at the rest of the Slytherins.

Draco suddenly realized that Blaise would be very much alone in a room full of Death Eaters and he frowned.

"You're going to be alright, aren't you?" he asked.

"Course," said Blaise, brushing off his concern.

"You sure?" asked Draco, searching the other boy to find reason for the nonchalance. Blaise rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, before leaning in and speaking softly.

"My great-grandmother was fey," he said. "I inherited some of her…defensive traits when I turned seventeen last winter. A few months after you obliviated Nott and his gang, they tried to curse me while I was sleeping, but I went all psycho-like, with fangs and claws, so they won't try anything again."

"When was this?" asked Draco.

"When you were sick in the hospital wing," said Blaise. "Besides, I'm all chummy with the Golden Trio now."

"Let me know if they do try anything," said Draco. "I'll take off points, give them detention, and maybe even obliviate them again."

Dinner gradually came to a close, and by the end some of the younger students were asleep on the tables. Dumbledore finally dismissed the students, the Prefects leading the first years up to the dorms. Draco ignored Dumbledore's gesture for him and Hermione to meet him and instead pushed his way over to where Potter and Weasley were directing the first years upstairs.

"Potter, a word," he said, not giving the boy an option but pulling him aside. He looked pointedly at Laney, traveling out the door, and Potter followed his gaze. He turned to the boy-hero. "That, Potter," he said, his eyes boring into the emerald pools, "is my niece. She is a Half-Blood, do you know what that means?"

Harry's eyes were confused, but mostly because Draco had taken him completely off guard.

"Oi, Malfoy!" Weasley yelled from where he was herding children up the stairs. "Get your ferret paws off of him!" He started forward, intent on rescuing Harry, but then the Ravenclaw students started pouring through the doorway and he was swept away in the mass of bodies.

Draco turned back to Harry, his grip tightening on the Gryffindor's arm as he explained.

"Listen carefully, Potter, I will only say this once. The Malfoy line has many secrets, one of which was Lukas Malfoy. He was the result of a fling of my father's with another old Pureblood line, and while that is rather scandalous, it is still acceptable. What is not acceptable is that he married a Muggle woman and had a child before he was killed. Laney is that child, and now the disgrace is just beginning. There are many people who would benefit with the sudden disappearance of said blemish, do you understand?"

"They want to kill your niece," said Harry nodding, following the conversation, but then it finally seemed to sink in. "You had a brother?"

"Not important right now," said Draco. "What is important is that you watch her, got that? Keep an eye open for her. If anything happens to her, I go after the perpetrators, and then I go after you."

Harry nodded. "I'll look out for her," he promised, eyes sincere.

"Good," said Draco. He released Potter's arm and then headed over to where Dumbledore was waiting with Hermione in the quickly emptying Great Hall. Hermione was watching him curiously, but Dumbledore spoke before she could do more than send him questioning glances.

"I trust you all read the letter describing your duties?" he asked.

Draco nodded. It had been the expected things: The Heads are responsible for patrolling, for planning the dances, for keeping general order, and had power to take points and assign detentions should the case require it.

"Yes," said Hermione, nodding vigorously.

"Good, good," said Dumbledore. "Well, then, I shall take you to your dorm and allow you to turn in for the night. You both have a very busy year ahead of you."

He twinkled at them both and led them out of the Great Hall and onto the third floor before stopping at a painting detailing a valley landscape, complete with a river and leafy trees.

"The password is parsley," said Dumbledore, "but you can change it if you so desire."

The portrait swung in obligingly, but so did the entire wall so that it was not necessary to climb into the room. Draco stepped in, following Hermione, and took in his new home.

There was a fireplace on the left, with two couches and armchairs surrounding a coffee table in front of it. Bookshelves lined the walls, and two large windows, complete with window seats, cushions, and long drapes were directly across the room. To the right a wide staircase led up to a landing where three doors were situated. The far door had Hermione's name, the middle was the washroom, and Draco had the last.

Draco supposed that the room would have been very suitable had not the carpet and drapes been green and the couches and armchairs red, obviously in an attempt to combine their house colors. The walls were kindly a dark wood paneling.

"It's beautiful," said Hermione, completely enthused.

If it was the sodding North Pole, Draco thought darkly, but he thanked the Headmaster who bid them both goodnight and left.

"Alright, Malfoy," said Granger, turning to him once the Headmaster had left. "We need some ground rules."

Draco resisted the urge to groan.

"First off, no friends over except on weekends, or unless it's a study group. Secondly, tell me first before you bring friends over. Third, I take showers at seven each morning. Is that going to be a problem?"

Draco shook his head.

"Fourthly, keep things relatively quiet during the week, especially if you have people over. That's about it, do you have anything you want to add?"

"No."

"Alright," said Granger, and then they looked at each other awkwardly before Granger spoke up again. "You're disowned, aren't you?" she asked.

Draco had expected the confrontation, but he hadn't expected it so soon.

"How is that any of your business?" he asked.

Granger shrugged. "Well, I do have to work with you, so I suppose I should know these things."

"Being Head Girl does not allow you to pry into my private life," said Draco, and he walked past her to take a seat on the couch and, despite it being red, it was quite comfortable. Granger followed.

"It's the only thing that makes sense," she said, sitting across from him. "Blaise was talking on the train, and he said some things, and you said you were safe, which means you're not a Death Eater."

"Haven't we already gone over this? It's none of your business."

"It's just nice to have facts verified by an outside source."

"You call a few words enough for verification of your wild theories?"

"They're not really wild," said Hermione. "You're in a Ministry-run operation to spy on Death Eaters, but you know that a few key people running the operation are in the Order. You are associating with Blaise, who wants nothing to do with the Dark Lord. You also have a niece who seems quite fond of you even though part of her last name is a Muggle surname. She must be quite the disgrace to the line of Malfoy, and my guess is that you're an even bigger tarnish."

"Is there a point to this, Granger?"

"And that's another thing. You haven't called me 'Mudblood' yet. In fact, you stopped about halfway through last year. You also haven't made any obnoxious boasts about your father."

Draco released a silent sigh. "Why do you even care?"

He watched Granger shrug, her face scrunched slightly. It was an almost child-like gesture of concentration.

"Honestly," she said. "I'm not quite sure. I like to figure things out, to understand them, and right now you're rather confusing me. I have to say, I never expected you would defect from the whole Pureblood thing, and there's part of me that still says not to trust you, but I want to."

"That's your Gryffindorish tendencies to look at the good of every one. It's a good way to get you killed. Listen to the part that's saying I'm a Death Eater bastard and leave it at that."

He wanted her to leave it at that. He wanted some peace, some privacy.

"But you see I can't," said Hermione, looking oddly triumphant. "Because if I say that, then I'm really no better than the Death Eaters who are prejudiced against Muggleborns."

Draco was smart, was a genius, but her logic completely threw him.

"What?"

"Well, it's like me calling you 'Pureblood' as a derogatory term and never getting to know you because of my preconceived notion that you might turn me over to the Dark Lord."

"But I actually might do that," said Draco. "I mean, you have no way of knowing. Not trusting a Pureblood with close ties to the Dark Lord is just common sense and practicing survival skills."

"But it's still a form of prejudice," said Granger. "And if I really am on the side that is supposed to be against hate and prejudice, then I should at least try to trust you."

"Even if it means getting carted off to the Dark Lord?"

"Even if it means getting carted off to the Dark Lord."

He stared at her, incomprehension muddling his mind. He finally shook his head.

"Merlin, you and Potter do make a good couple, don't you? The hero and the idealist."

She suddenly laughed, which just confused him even more. He was going to get a headache.

"Sorry, it's not you," she explained. "It's just that most people think that me and Ron make a better couple."

"Weasel?" asked Draco. "You and him? You're complete opposites though."

"And so people generally thought we were perfect together, that we completed each other."

That was the most nonsensical thing Draco had ever heard, and he told her so.

"Not very romantic, are you?" she asked.

He could tell that the question was rhetoric and he was glad. He had a feeling that she knew more about him than he was comfortable with.

"Anyway," she said. "Getting back on topic, I guess that I wanted to apologize for being such a bitch-,"

He blinked. Did she really just swear?

"-and," she continued, "I would really like to become friends with you, or at least become compatible working partners."

"Friends?" he asked.

"Compatible working partners, then?" she asked, undaunted. She seemed to take pity on his stunned expression. "How about we just take it one day at a time?"

She held out her hand, looking at him expectantly. He slowly took it.

"Alright, Granger," he said.

"Hermione," she corrected. "First name basis helps establish a more personal atmosphere."

Draco blinked. Was she serious?

"Well, good night, Draco," she said, shaking his hand and then releasing it, her lips easily pronouncing his given name. "I'm off to bed. I'm exhausted."

And with that she picked up her bag and headed towards the stairs. Draco could only stare at the couch where she had been sitting, trying to work through exactly what had happened, and exactly what he should do now. He needed allies, yes, but there was more to this. She was offering friendship as well.

He remembered the first time Bill had offered to be his friend. He had laughed at the Professor, but Bill had been serious, and he had been a friend. And it was a good thing too, the friendship, it had helped Draco figure things out, given him someone to rely on. Bill wasn't here right now, something that Draco regretted. He needed to talk to the red-haired man, to get his advice on what to do. But he had a feeling he knew what Bill would say. He looked up.

"Gra-Hermione," he said. She was on the stairs already, but she turned.

"Yes?"

"I'm disinherited," he said. "The paperwork is still being processed for my legal disownment."

She nodded. "I'm sorry," she said. And he had a feeling she really was. "Don't stay up too late," she said, before she closed her door and left him alone. "Big day tomorrow, Head Boy and all." It was said in a light tone of voice; she was teasing him.

He smirked in closing and she shut the door.

There were always at least three children who were homesick the first night, some crying, others running off into sibling's rooms if they had relatives in the same house. If not, the Head of House usual comforted the child, or went to fetch the siblings for the children if they were in another house. That was why Minerva McGonagall was at the portrait in front of the Head dormitory with the unpleasant task of having to wake one Draco Malfoy.

Laney wasn't crying like the other homesick girls, but she was sitting up in the common room when she should be sleeping. Minerva had taken an immediate liking to the little girl; she reminded her a lot of Lily Evans, bright, cheerful, well, not now of course. It was Minerva's opinion that Draco Malfoy would not be safe around his niece. No doubt his father would wish to expunge the existence of one Half-Blood grand-daughter, and she was sure Draco felt the same. But Laney had asked for him, and she had such beautiful eyes.

It was one-thirty in the morning and McGonagall was expecting the Heads to be asleep so she entered the common room. Draco Malfoy immediately looked up from where he was sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace, leaning against the side of the couch and reading a book.

"Is something the matter Professor?" he asked, standing and putting the book down.

Minerva stared for a moment, not used to seeing the Malfoy boy in anything less than his fine silk robes. He was in his black school trousers and white button-up shirt, but the sleeves were rolled partially up and the first few buttons were undone. It was the most informal she had ever seen him, and it was a shock. She was so used to associating him with the expensive silk robes that it never occurred to her that he would wear anything else.

"Your niece cannot sleep and would like to speak with you," she said primly. She watched him, but his face remained impassive, merely nodding and joining her at the door, and Minerva, against her better judgment, led the snake to her lion's den.

Laney was still curled up on the couch with her kitten when they entered, but she smiled when she saw her uncle. Minerva watched as the Slytherin crossed over to the girl and crouched down.

"You can't sleep?" he asked quietly, and it was startling to hear his voice without the drawl or derisive tones.

"Mum usually reads to me before I go to bed," said Laney. "Or she talks to me in French."

"You speak French?" Draco asked.

"No, I just like listening to the sounds. Mum says that Dad used to speak French to her every night, and so she did for me too."

Minerva watched Draco nod, and then get up to sit next to the girl. Laney shifted, so that she was leaning up again. When Draco spoke next, it was so soft she couldn't understand him, but then she realized that the words weren't English.

"Je sais les cieux crevant en éclairs, et les trombes/Et les ressacs et les courants : Je sais le soir/L'aube exaltée ainsi qu'un peuple de colombes/Et j'ai vu quelque fois ce que l'homme a cru voir!"

"You speak it too," said Laney, snuggling in closer. "Did Dad teach you?"

The edges of Draco's lips turned up softly, the ghost of a smile. "I am French, like your father, but I moved here when I was a few years younger than you."

"What were you saying?" asked Laney.

"A poem," said Draco. "About a ship. Would you like to hear more?"

Laney nodded, and then made herself comfortable. Minerva listened as the foreign words started again, exotic in their intonation, and soothing in the rhythm of the poem. She left the room, somehow certain that Laney would get to sleep that night.

The translation:

"I have come to know the skies splitting with lightnings, and the waterspouts

And the breakers and currents ; I know the evening,

And Dawn rising up like a flock of doves,

And sometimes I have seen what men have imagined they saw !"

The Drunken Boat by Arthur Rimbaud, translation by Oliver Bernard, eighth stanza. (I love that stanza. I bet it sounds even better in French)

AUTHOR'S NOTE: So, you probably want to know what happened to me. No, I did not die, move, lose internet, abandon the story, or get abducted by aliens. I was, however, sick for awhile (the near hospital kind of sick), and then I had awful writer's block. The kind where you sit at the computer and stare. Blankly. You may right a word here or there, but it's stuff like "The" or "He" or "Water flows into the ocean, only to return again. Ducks aren't yellow."

For those of you who I responded to, you know the bad news already (or, rather, bad news for you), and now I'll tell the rest. I am going overseas for this college semester, or more specifically, England. I will not be updating while I am away for a few reasons. One, I'll be really busy with school and also tourism. I'll be hopefully visiting France (Paris more specifically), Switzerland, and Italy as well. Two, writing and posting can be rather stressful at times, and being in a foreign country living out of a suitcase is stressful enough. And three, I don't know how good my service is over there. Oh yeah, I also want to kick back a bit, see if I can't get over the rest of my writer's block.

I realize many of you are upset, and I understand. It sucks having a story go on vacation like that, especially if you really like it. I promise you, however, that (barring an emergency or tragedy) I will begin updating again late December. I (again barring any unforeseeable incidences) will never leave a story incomplete. This story will end.

Thank you for understanding, and if you don't understand, well, try. I love all of my readers, and I love all of my reviewers even more (hey, it's the truth, you can't love what you don't know). I will see you all around Christmas.

Yours truly,

Aduro

p.s. I leave for the airport at six in the morning, and it's twelve a.m. now, so I'm going to bed. Wish me luck!





9. Relations and Rumors

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a bunch of new clothes from Englad though!

A/N: So, this is me, back from England, and this chapter is a Christmas to my beautiful reviewers. I just want to say thank you to all of those people who wished me well on my trip, and to allof those who reviewed. Thank you! And I apologize for the non-individualized responses to the reviews, but I basically just got back to England, and rushed to put this up in time for Christmas. I love you all. Enjoy.

Relations and Rumors

Draco left the bathroom, steam curling out behind him as he stepped into the hall that now felt frigid even though he was dressed in the uniform trousers and shirt. He fiddled with the button on his cuffs as he walked over to Hermione's door and knocked.

"I'm out," he said, and then walked back to his room in search of his shoes.

A week and a half had past and it was surprising how quickly they fell into pattern. He could hear Hermione start her own shower as he shoved his feet into his black shoes and then combed out his hair, leaving it to air dry. He shrugged on his school robes and left his room, shutting the door behind him.

Already, on the low table in the middle of the couches and armchairs, was the Daily Prophet, a school subscription that he didn't have to pay for, and a charming tea and coffee set along with a platter of biscuits and other small tidbits. Being Head Boy definitely had its perks.

Draco sat in his usual armchair, pouring himself a mug of coffee and then picking up the Daily Prophet and reading the articles. Hermione came down a while later, sitting across from him and fixing herself a cup of tea. It was raspberry today. Although she liked a variety of tea in the morning, she generally stuck with the fruit flavors.

He wordlessly handed her the pages he was done with and she began to look them over as well. Although they were able to co-exist, they didn't really interact with each other. It was his fault, he knew. Hermione often tried to rope him into conversations.

As usual, the real story about what was going on in the wizarding world could be found in the smaller stories in the back of the paper. A decline in Fudge's popularity meant that a sacking was being considered and the quiet, natural death of Muggleborn Horace Jones on the Board of Governors meant murder, most likely Death Eater caused.

"Anything interesting?" asked Hermione.

"Not really," he lied.

He put that paper down and picked up the old Potions book he had been looking through for the past week, having exhausted all other sources. The Persian Runes had talked of a counter to Veritaserum, and he had translated all of the ingredients save one called 'moon flower'. The problem was that there was no such plant in the modern world which meant that the herb was either re-named or extinct. He was hoping for the former, but so far he couldn't find a trace of the plant.

He and Hermione both left for breakfast together, but only because she left at the time Draco usually walked down as well and they went their separate ways once they reached the Great Hall, Hermione to the rest of the Golden Trio, and Draco, after making sure that Laney was there and safe, to the end of the Slytherin table with Blaise.

"Potions," said Blaise with a groan. "I hate Potions."

"It's NEWT's Potions," said Draco. "You're supposed to hate it."

"I don't see you complaining," said Blaise.

Draco shrugged. "I like Potions."

It was true. NEWT's Potions was the most challenging course he had taken at Hogwarts, and while that meant he could still do the homework and long essays without ever having to pick up a book, he still had to pay attention in class. Not close attention, of course, but attention none-the-less.

"You're a sick man, Draco," said Blaise, shaking his head and stirring his porridge vigorously. "A sick man."

The mail came then, an owl landing in front of Draco which made him frown slightly. He wasn't expecting anything and there was no sender marked. He checked the envelope over, but there wasn't a curse on it either. He opened it carefully and unfolded the letter. A page full of Persian Runes stared back at him.

Bill had left for France a week ago. Draco knew this because the former Professor had sent him a few owls, making sure he had settled in all right and what not. Then Bill had crossed the Channel and the letters had stopped because Bill was keeping a low profile. Draco hadn't expected a letter of information so soon.

He frowned again, wondering if he had time to decode the letter right now.

"What's the troubled look for?" asked Blaise.

"Oh, the usual," said Draco vaguely, folding the letter back up and putting it in his pocket. He would decode it later, when he had time to do it properly.

Time trickled closer to the first class of the day, and students slowly began grabbing their bags and heading out, the students having Divination leaving first so they could make it up the tower on time. Draco waited until Blaise was done playing with his food and then they walked down to the dungeons, Blaise humming the funeral march under his breath which made Draco's lips quirk up.

NEWT's potions was originally a class where only students receiving an 'O' or higher on their OWL's could make it into the advanced class. Because there was no grade higher than an 'O', Draco, Hermione, and two Ravenclaws were the only students that Snape would allow in his class. Dumbledore, however, said that due to the small number, Snape would have to open up his class to students receiving an 'E' or above. That was why Potter and Weasley, along with Blaise, Pansy, Nott, and six Ravenclaws were admitted as well.

Today they were learning to make the Wolfsbane, and Snape took the initiative to insult Professor Lupin at every opportunity to the general amusement of Nott and a few Ravenclaws who were Purebloods as well. Draco had a feeling that the Wolfsbane lesson was to see which students might be able to make the potion for Lupin during the school year as Snape was no doubt busy with playing double agent and teaching.

"The blood of the wolf is added next," said Snape, stalking the aisles and watching them all. "No, Mr. Weasley, three units, not three rounded ones. Measure!"

Ron flushed red, in anger, not embarrassment. The red liquid in his cup was only a millimeter over the marker line.

"Now, right afterwards stir clockwise until the potion begins to boil. Yes, very good Mr. Nott. Mister Malfoy," that was a hiss, "what exactly are you doing?"

Snape turned on him, an ugly look on his face and immediately the class quieted. It had been one and a half weeks from the beginning of school and Snape had pointedly ignored him up until this time. Now, it appeared, he was going to play the part of a Death Eater under orders to make his life miserable. It would be the first time the students in the class would witness the new position of Draco Malfoy, not as teacher's pet, but as the dethroned Prince of Slytherin.

"Stirring clockwise," said Draco coolly.

"You are not stirring, you are creating a whirlpool. Is it such a hard task for you, Mr. Malfoy, that you cannot even stir your potion properly?" The words were said in the same derisive tone Snape reserved for Potter.

The class went absolutely silent as the students stared in shock, except for Nott and the Pureblood Ravenclaws.

"You're right," said Draco, shocking them all. "I am a terrible stirrer of Potions. Would you, sir, deign to teach me the proper technique of moving a large silver spoon throughout a semi-coagulated liquid?"

It was said in such a contrite, appealing sort of tone that the sarcasm was blinding. Snape scowled as the students tittered, face hardening in rage.

"Ten points from Slytherin, Mr. Malfoy, and watch your tone."

There were a few gasps and Draco merely smirked. Like he cared about points?

"And now add the crushed pearl-blossom petals. In ancient times this flower was called the 'moon flower' because it only blooms on a full moon and it was thought that the petals could stave off werewolves, so be sure to wear some for your Defense class if you are worried about being bit."

The Golden Trio looked outraged at the slight to their favorite professor, but Draco's mind was spinning too quickly to take note. Moon flower was pearl-blossom. It existed; it had just been renamed. Now all he needed was the space to test his theory on a counter to Veritaserum.

He spoke up in a drawling sort of tone, a sneer painted on his lips. "If we wear garlic necklaces, will we ward you off as well?"

The class inhaled collectively, waiting for the explosion as Snape turned on Draco, his features schooled into a look of outrage. Draco looked past that and saw that Snape's eyebrow was raised fractionally at him. He gave the teacher a meaningful look.

Snape acquiesced. "Detention tonight, Mr. Malfoy, or should I say, Draco?"

A low blow, but one that would be expected of a loyal Death Eater. Snape had to save face, and Draco hid the flinch at the cutting referral to his disinherited state. Nott was laughing cruelly, and some of the smarter Ravenclaws were catching on and staring at him in shock.

Potter obviously realized that Draco had been insulted in some manner because he was glaring at Snape, and Hermione was shooting him a sympathetic look. Beside him Blaise growled at Nott, opening his mouth and showing elongated fangs, which made the Slytherin choke on his laughter, paling slightly. Draco found that the support of the three actually made the words less cutting and he smirked, shooting off a wordless spell at Nott's potion.

Nott's cauldron exploded, showering the boy with the red, gloppy substance and the room descended into chaos, only quieting once Snape bellowed for them all to leave, swearing that if he found the culprit of the explosion he would give them a lifetime detention with Filch.

The class left, chattering intensely with one another, and Draco could tell from the furtive looks that most of the conversation was about him.

"He called you Draco," said Blaise as they wandered up to the library. They had a full half an hour before their next class.

"He did," Draco agreed.

"Rather blunt."

"It was."

"Going to create quite a stir."

Draco grimaced. That was just what he needed.

It only took a few minutes, quite surprising really, and then the rumors were spreading. Draco Malfoy was disowned. Draco had left his family deliberately because of Laney. Draco had dueled his father for control of the estate and lost. His own particular favorite was the rumor that he had fallen in love with Hermione Granger and saved her from a Death Eater mob and was hence forth disowned. Several people were inclined to believe this one, seeing how he and the Gryffindor girl hadn't fought or even exchanged insults yet this school year. It did, however, cause quite a commotion during dinner.

Supper was the usual affair, students discussing classes or the latest in Quidditch. Draco, by then, was used to the curious glances the students were giving him, wondering if he really was disowned. He was not prepared for Weasley to come barging over.

"The hell have you done to Hermione, you filthy git?" he demanded.

Draco pushed his half-eaten dinner away from him. "What are you on about, Weasel?" he sneered. "Has your poverty depraved your mind as well as your pocket?"

It wasn't exactly the nicest thing to say, especially to a boy that was so close to Potter and the rest of the Order, not to mention he was the brother of Bill, but Draco disliked the red-haired ball of emotion in front of him.

"I swear, Malfoy, if you have done anything I will personally strangle you and then-,"

"Ronald!"

That was Hermione's sharp voice, putting the boy in check. She was accompanied by Potter, who looked somewhat amused. Draco had a feeling he didn't want to know why that expression was on Potter's face, but then Hermione put her hands on her hips and frowned at the Weasley.

"Honestly, Ron," she said reprovingly. "Is that anyway to treat the father of my baby?"

Blaise choked on his mashed potatoes beside Draco, who was too shocked to pound his friend on the back. He was certain that his face betrayed his surprise and it was quite a while before he managed to regain control of his features.

"Pardon?" he asked, his mask slipping back on and regarding the trio coldly.

Hermione rolled her eyes. "Apparently the general consensus is that you defied your father out of your love for me after it was discovered I was with child and we eloped."

"We eloped?" Draco repeated. He wasn't usually one to be inarticulate, but it wasn't every day one found out about his runaway marriage.

"Yes," said Hermione. "Rather romantic, wouldn't you say?"

"I suppose," said Draco. He turned to Potter. "No objections, I hope? And really, Granger, I don't appreciate my spouse dating while we are still wed."

"Yes, about that," said Hermione, wringing her hands in mock agitation. "Look, Draco, it's not you, it's me, alright? This just isn't working out between us and, well, I'm going to apply for a divorce."

"I see," said Draco, going along with Hermione just because Ron was gaping at the both of them. "We can still be friends," he said, picking up his tea. "Best wishes, and all." He saluted her with his tea cup and she turned to Ron.

"There, you see, Ron. It's all set. We're getting a divorce, are you happy?"

Ron choked slightly, completely flustered. "You seriously married him?" he demanded.

"No!" said Hermione, exasperated. "I was showing you how ridiculous the rumor was. No, we didn't elope and no, I am not pregnant."

"Then why don't you fight anymore?"

"Because we," here she gestured between herself and Draco, "have grown up and put prejudices aside. It's what you should be doing!"

"But Harry and Malfoy don't fight either," said Ron.

Hermione groaned. Any minute now, Draco knew, and she would be pulling at her hair. "Harry's grown up too, Ron. And Draco's a good guy."

Draco scowled, seriously affronted at the label, but Ron was not convinced.

"He's got you all under a spell, hasn't he? He's got you all muddled up because he's working with You-Know-Who." He turned to Draco. "I don't trust you, ferret. Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater."

Draco was about to say something cutting back, but then a small voice interrupted.

"Uncle Draco?"

Draco looked down to see Laney at the table and she was frowning slightly.

"What's wrong?" he asked.

Laney hesitated for a moment, but then she blurted out, "Did you really run away from your family because of me?" she asked.

Merde, Draco thought. He had completely forgotten about what effect the rumors would have on Laney. Shit. She didn't even know about Purebloods and what not, or maybe she did now that she was here.

He suppressed a groan. This whole thing was so completely complicated with no one getting the full story. It was assumed he was disowned, but no one was confirming the rumor. It was assumed that Laney was indeed a Malfoy, but again, no one knew how that exactly worked out. It was also assumed that Draco was no longer the Slytherin Prince, because he was in a compatible working relationship with Hermione Granger and he no longer used the word 'Mudblood', but once more, there was no hard proof.

Draco wondered if it would just be easier to tell everyone that he was disowned because he refused the Dark Lord, but he doubted anyone would believe him and besides, he couldn't do that to Lucius. It would be admitting his father was a Death Eater; besides, he liked his privacy.

"Let's go, Laney," he said, standing up. "I'll explain it to you, alright?"

She nodded, grabbing his hand as they walked out of the Great Hall together. He took her to the old Ancient Runes classroom, the one that Bill had used when he was a Professor and they both sat on the desks.

"Do you know about Purebloods and Muggleborns?" he asked her.

Laney nodded. "Harry explained it to me," she said.

Draco blinked at her. "Harry Potter?" he asked.

"Yeah. Sarah Johnson, a girl in my year, well, she has parents who aren't magical, and she got called a Mudblood by one of the Slytherins. We didn't know what that meant, Sarah and Evie and I, so we went to tell a Prefect, and then Harry explained it. Some Purebloods think that they are better than everyone else, but not all of them, because Ron is a Pureblood but he's nice. Are you a Pureblood, Uncle Draco?"

"Yes, I am," said Draco.

"But you aren't prejudiced, are you?"

"Not anymore," said Draco.

Laney frowned. "But you were?"

"Laney," said Draco, trying to figure out how to put this. His fingers automatically went into their pattern. "The Malfoy line is one of the purest wizarding lines in all the world, and also one of the richest. Because of that, the Malfoys are generally one of the most prejudiced wizards."

Laney obviously got the drift of where this was going.

"Prejudiced like You-Know-Who?" she asked.

"Yeah," said Draco, his fingers fumbling a bit. "You see…," he trailed off, trying to figure out a way to put this, and then he realized that there was no good or better way. No matter how he tried to put this, Lucius was, and would always be – "My father is a Death Eater."

For a moment, Laney didn't react and Draco was worried that she didn't know who they were, and then he would have to explain it, which would be even worse, but then Laney's eyes widened.

"A Death Eater?" she repeated. "So he…he kills people?"

Oh Merlin, it hurt so much to hear that from the lips of a child, but he nodded.

"Lucius Malfoy was put on trail for Death Eater affiliations after the last war, but he told them that he was under the Imperious, which is an Unforgivable curse which controls a person's mind, but then when the Dark Lord came back, he rejoined."

"But you're not a Death Eater," said Laney with conviction, as if she knew he wasn't one even without proof. Her belief in him was uplifting.

"No, I'm not," he said. "Lucius wanted me to join, but I didn't, and so he disowned me, made me no longer part of the family."

"So, I didn't make you leave?" asked Laney.

"No, but you want to know something?"

She nodded.

"Even if Lucius didn't disown me, I still would have left for you."

Laney smiled and jumped off her desk to throw her arms around him, and he returned the embrace. She pulled back after a few moments, her face going serious.

"Did your dad kill my dad?" she asked.

"No," said Draco, shaking his head. "Lucius, my father, he…loved your father, but my grand-mere, your great grandmother, was so prejudiced that she didn't want the Malfoy line in anyway associated with Muggles, so she killed him."

"Were you there?" asked Laney, eyes wide. Draco had a sudden flash to that day, Lukas smiling, grinning. He had picked Draco up and spun him around, and then laughing as Draco swayed dizzily when he put his half-brother back down. It was a sunny day, they were in the sun parlor, and the green of the curse contrasted so terribly with the whites and ivories and soft pale blues of the décor.

"Yes," he said softly. "I was there."

He returned to his dormitory after dropping Laney off at the Gryffindor tower to pick up his things for detention with Snape. Hermione was bent over some work, but her face was in such a frown of concentration, Draco immediately knew it wasn't school work. He got a glimpse of Ancient Runes.

"Your correspondent?" he asked, gathering his bag.

She nodded. "I think I've got it," she said, "but now I'm completely paranoid that I translated it wrong, that for some reason the code I'm using picked out the entirely wrong message. What are the odds of that, do you think? That, completely by accident, another code works on the same letter as well?"

"Infinitesimal," said Draco.

"That's what I thought," said Hermione.

Snape was waiting for him at the Potions Lab, sitting behind his desk with an eyebrow raised.

"I trust you have a good reason for wanting a detention?" he asked.

"I need lab space and ingredients," said Draco, shutting the door behind him.

"What for?" asked Snape.

"A counter for Veritaserum," said Draco. "Or rather, a suppressant."

"A suppressant?" asked Snape. "And you think you can do that, why?"

"Ingredients mentioned in a war account dated centuries ago."

"But you have no instructions?" asked Snape. "No proportions?"

"No."

"But you still think that you can do what every Potions Master has tried and failed at?"

"I'm not trying to oppose the effects," said Draco. "Just suppress it."

"So you've said. May I ask what you mean by that?"

"There are two parts to the Veritaserum. One is the compulsion potion, which makes the victim speak. The second is the truth potion, which makes the victim speak the truth. Most people over look the first part, but they don't realize that without the compulsion potion in the serum, the victim would have the choice not to speak if they so desire."

Snape actually looked intrigued, so Draco stepped forward and put the translation on the desk in front of him. Snape read it over, his brows furrowed, but then he nodded.

"It looks promising, but you don't really think that you can do this by yourself, do you?"

"I was hoping you might help," said Draco. He knew that Severus Snape was one of the best Potions Masters in all of Europe, and that his insight would be most beneficial. It would most likely reduce the time it would take him by half.

"Hoping?" asked Snape.

"I'm prepared to make the Wolfsbane Potion for you," said Draco, knowing that Severus hated making that potion, and for a reason. The timing on the potion was so exact that if the maker was off by more than four seconds, the potion would be impotent.

"I would still have to supervise you though," said Snape.

"Actually," said Draco, "I'm certified."

Snape raised his eyebrows, surprised.

"Summer before sixth year," said Draco.

"Impressive," said Snape. "Very well than, Mr. Malfoy, you have yourself a deal. Where do you suppose we start?"

"Making Veritaserum," said Draco. "We'll have to test the counter after all, and this time when we are brewing it, I want to make some notes, see if we can figure out how much of each ingredient we will need."

Snape gave a thin smile. "Good answer. Shall we begin then?"

Two hours later and Draco returned to his dorm room. He and Snape had started the Veritaserum, but it would take a month for the potion to be finished. It didn't really matter though because the important thing was to examine each step of the potion and analyze each ingredient. Then they would have to figure out a viable way of contradicting the potion with the ingredients on the list.

Hermione was still up, working on her homework now, and Draco sat at the table and pulled out the letter Bill had sent. He was intrigued to see what Bill had gathered already and he was excited to hear from his former professor, although he would never admit the latter. Not even to himself.

It was because of those reasons, and because he still had a lot of homework to start, that he didn't take his time decoding the letter, in fact, he completed it rather quickly. The information Bill incorporated into the message was intriguing. The Death Eaters and their own spies were looking into ancient manuscripts, though for what reason was unclear as of yet, and as of now, they were doing so discreetly.

He wrote out the translation on the parchment issued to them by Kingsley for the specific purpose of writing to the Aurors. There were protective spells on the parchments, ones that were specific to the Aurors. It would take days for anyone else to even attempt to open it, and that was if the Auror owls, which were faster and stronger and quite dangerous, were intercepted.

He folded and sealed the letter, intent on sending it out the next morning, and then looked up to see Hermione studying him. He raised an eyebrow.

"You decoded that rather quickly," she said, looking at him curiously.

Draco pulled up his shields immediately, silently cursing himself for allowing himself to relax when he was still in the company of another. He would have to be careful; just because he was in his own room didn't mean that he could be any less wary.

"It was an easier code," he explained.

"Oh," said Hermione, not looking the least bit convinced.

He didn't try to explain further, rather pulled out a few books and made himself busy. In reality he was re-reading the letter Bill had sent, because the letter, outside of the code, was a personal one, and reading Bill's kind words helped put his mind at ease.

"I'm just saying," said Ron, "that you both seem to be on quite friendly terms with Malfoy and I want to know why."

Harry sighed, knowing that Malfoy would kill him if he did tell Ron about a certain incident involving a Cadillac convertible that occurred over the summer.

"I keep telling you Ron, I can't tell you. I would if I could, but I'm sworn to secrecy."

"Oh, but you can tell Hermione? Because she's your girlfriend? Is that it?"

"No!" said Harry.

"Then why is Hermione so nice to him?"

"I told you Ron," said Hermione. "We called a truce."

Harry, however, knew that there was something else that had happened. He could tell she wasn't telling the whole truth because Hermione looked away when she spoke.

"I don't believe this," said Ron. "Are you daft? Are both of you nutters?"

"Who's a nutter?" asked Ginny, coming to perch on the armrest of the couch Harry and Hermione were sitting on.

"Them," said Ron, gesturing wildly. "They're practically friends with Malfoy!"

"Draco?" asked Ginny. "Well, what's wrong with that?"

Harry's head whipped around to gape at Ginny. What had happened between her and Malfoy? Beside him Hermione was frowning as well. Ron was just red.

"What?" he yelped.

Ginny shrugged, nonchalantly, as if being faced with an enraged brother didn't bother her in the least bit. But then again, Ginny always seemed to be imperturbable.

"Think about it," she said. "Last year Draco saved my life from the ghoul. Last summer we hear of a bunch of seventh year Slytherins who have got the mark and Draco's name isn't among them. This year, he shows up with the most adorable niece ever who is a Half-blood, and he actually cares for her. Now, there are rumors going around that he is disowned. Put two and two and two and two together. It's called multiplication and it's not that hard."

Ron spluttered for a bit and then Ginny got up, shrugging.

"Of course, I could be reading too hard into it," she said, putting a hand on Ron's shoulder reassuringly. "I could just want to believe that Draco Malfoy really is a good guy because then it means he's available for all of us good girls out there, and I am completely interested."

Ginny gave her brother a sweet smile and practically skipped away while Harry wondered if wizards had a spell for CPR or if he would need to give his friend mouth-to-mouth because Ron was so outraged at the statement he forgot to breathe.

The red-head finally remembered the survival instinct and took a deep breath. Harry reached out for Hermione's hand and gripped tight. She returned the pressure and they waited for the outburst. They were not disappointed.

"ARE ALL OF YOU OUT OF YOUR BLOODY MINDS? THIS IS MALFOY! THE FERRET FACE GIT THAT MADE OUR LIVES HELL! THE BOY THAT ALMOST KILLED BUCKBEAK AND CALLS HERMIONE THE M-WORD AND TURNED IN THE D.A. AND PRETENDED TO BE A DEMENTOR DURING QUIDDITCH AND WANTS TO KILL US ALL AND-AND…AND HE'S MALFOY!"

"He has a point," chirped up an Irish voice. Seamus and Dean stood in the entrance of the Gryffindor common room. "I mean, yeah, so things are a little fishy about Malfoy, and there are all the rumors going around about him, but is there any proof? Any hard evidence?"

"Yes!" exclaimed Ron, looking extremely grateful for the support. "Finally some sense! Harry, I know that you have this saving-thing going on, but some people do not need to be saved."

"Not need to be saved?" asked Hermione, speaking up and her voice going sterner than McGonagall. It was in that instant that Harry felt a flash of empathy for his best friend. His girl-friend could be an extremely formidable opponent.

Ron recognized his mistake and tried to amend it. "Not want to be saved," he said. "I meant he didn't want to be saved."

"A Freudian slip," said Hermione. "You meant that he didn't deserve to be saved, didn't you?"

Ron flushed and looked down, but he still muttered "It's Malfoy."

"Yes," said Hermione, "it is Malfoy. But you know what, Ron? Every person deserves salvation, even if it was Salazar himself. For you to deny someone redemption makes you no better than those Death Eaters and I think that we all need to get over our own prejudices."

"But, Hermione-," Ron tried.

"No! I'm serious Ron, and I want you to try to be nicer to him."

"Nice? Nice? Since when is he nice to me?"

He had a point, Harry conceded. Draco didn't seem to like the red-head very much, but then again, Draco didn't seem to really like anyone.

"Ron-,"

But Ron had enough and he stalked away. "Talk to me when you've finished your mercy project with that prick."

Dean and Seamus followed Ron up to the dorm and Hermione and Harry both sighed, Hermione leaning over to rest her head on Harry's shoulder. Harry pulled her closer and then shut his eyes, reveling in the feeling of having the girl he loved pressed against him. Too many of those who loved him were gone, his parents, Sirius, but this year Remus was back, and Hermione was his girlfriend. The only thing that kept this year from being as good as it could be with the whole Voldemort threat was Ron's refusal to trust Draco Malfoy. Harry really couldn't blame the red-head. Harry had a reason to trust him; Ron didn't.

But why did Hermione trust him then?

"What happened between you and Draco?" asked Hermione, speaking up before he could.

"What?"

"Something happened between you two, didn't it?" asked Hermione. "That's why you were worried about him on the train and why you haven't fought this year."

Harry nodded. "Yeah, something happened. Something that I still have trouble believing on occasion."

"You can't tell me."

It wasn't a question, but Harry answered anyway.

"I can't tell you," he agreed. "And you can't tell me either, whatever it was that happened between you two."

"I suppose he still manages to remain infuriating even when he's a good guy," mused Hermione, turning her face up to him and Harry couldn't resist but to place a quick kiss on them.

"Don't let him hear you say that," Harry said when he pulled back.

"I think we should," said Hermione. "Let's go study in the Head Common Room. You haven't seen it yet."

"Not from lack of trying," said Harry, following her out of the door.

"I didn't want to press a certain Slytherin too hard. I was afraid that if the common room was invaded right off from the start with a bunch of Gryffindors, I would chase him right back to Voldemort."

Harry laughed and then grabbed Hermione's hand, swinging them slightly as they walked. He liked the reassurance that she was really there with him.

Harry gaped at the room when Hermione finally led him in. It wasn't particularly extravagant, but with the rich colors and wood paneling, it looked exceedingly comfortable.

"There are to be no displays of public affection in my presence," came a familiar drawling voice.

Harry started, finally noticing that Draco Malfoy was seated in one of the armchairs, reading a book. His feet were propped up on a low table, and he looked quite at ease, not even looking up to acknowledge them.

"You don't really have a right to say that," said Hermione. "Goodness knows how many times I've caught you and some girl snogging in the halls when you were supposed to be patrolling in the past years."

Draco tilted his head slightly towards her but didn't say anything, which Harry took as a conceding of Hermione's point.

"So, Harry," asked Hermione. "What do you think?"

"I love it," said Harry. "Although, I can't say I'm a fan of the green and red." It made the room look something like a Christmas tree ornament.

"I like the colors," said Hermione. "It reminds me of you."

"Of me?" asked Harry, surprised.

"Of you in your Quidditch robes, red uniform, green eyes," explained Hermione. "Did I ever tell you the time I first realized I loved you?"

Harry shook his head and wrapped his arms around Hermione's waist when she stepped closer.

"It was last year, after the Quidditch stand was finally reconstructed and I was following you and Ron out to your practice. Of course, the Slytherins were there, and you had that race. The fire happened after that, and for a split second, I couldn't see you, and I thought that you were dead. It was as if my heart just stopped beating, and all I felt was cold, but then you appeared, and you were helping Ron. You were so brave then, but all I could think was that you were alive, and I knew then, that I loved you, more than a savior, and more than friend, but as a man, as Harry. So, red and green, like the robes and your eyes."

Harry kissed her. Long and hard. How could he not after a speech like that? He finally pulled back when he was out of air and a droll voice spoke up.

"You know, Granger, all you had to do was ask for some privacy."

Harry blushed red, finally realizing that the blond Slytherin had just been a witness to the intimate scene, but Hermione merely turned so that she was leaning against Harry as she faced the other boy.

"It's Hermione," she corrected, "and would you have really just left if I had asked you to?"

"Of course not," said the blond, packing up his books and then shrugging on his school robes. "But then you could have told me about your intent to blather romantical nonsense to your significant other, and I, in a bid to retain my sanity, would have left."

He shouldered the bag and brushed by them, heading out of the door before turning.

"I'll be in the library, come and get me when you want to patrol." He then nodded to the both of them in parting. "Hermione, Potter," and then he turned again.

"You can call me Harry, you know," Harry called after him.

Draco glanced back. "Merlin," he muttered, so that Harry could barely hear him, "you too, then?"

Harry could see the blond shake his head as he left, and then the door closed behind him. He turned to his girlfriend, who was looking very satisfied with herself.

"You said all of that just to make him leave?" he asked, wondering if he should feel hurt that she could make up such a beautiful story like that.

"Of course I did," said Hermione. "Besides, these couches are the most comfortable ever, and I want some cuddling time with my boyfriend. Somehow it wouldn't be the same with a certain Ice Prince making snide comments through it all."

She grabbed his hand and led him over, and Harry had to admit that the couches were indeed most comfortable, especially with Hermione curled up beside him.

"And anyway," she continued, turning his head to look at her. "The story I told you was one hundred percent true."

Harry looked into her warm brown eyes and smiled.

Happy to see me back? Like the chapter? Leave a review, cuz I missed you too!





10. One Slip because of a Snap

A/N: Hey, sorry about the long wait. I actually got in a car accident on the way to college (I'm fine, not a bruise on me – I think God gave me a guardian angel on the drive). So, I'm a little behind schedule, and here's the next chapter a little late. I'll try for Monday updates at the least.

Draco was sick of the rumors flying around school about him. Not only did he hate the attention and the searching gazes and whispers and points, but he absolutely hated the lack of respect, the lack of power.

Normally, when he strode through the halls, people pulled away slightly. Normally, when he glared at someone, they fell silent. Normally, when he spoke, people obeyed. No longer. Now, he was just like any other student. Worse, he was the student that was the recipient of the Slytherins taunts. Worst, everyone was delighted by it.

Well, not everyone. The younger students (fifth year and below) were still afraid of him, but the sixth and seventh years took delight in his new found position as the scum of Slytherin. While none of them would dare raise a hand or wand at him, they would laugh, spit out crude remarks, or goad the others on.

Draco ignored them for the most part. While he inwardly cursed the lot of them, he was not motivated to retaliate. He would not be the Ice Prince if every word caused him to break, and besides, he had a lot on his plate at the moment, and he was beginning to wonder if even a genius has limits.

There were the nightly sessions with Snape. Brewing Veritaserum was not easy, and it required a lot of exact work and different ingredients that needed specific times to be added, so every so often Draco would have to wake up in the middle of the night and add more.

There were also the letters from Bill to be decoded. While there weren't many with actual information, the former Professor liked to keep him in touch and up-to-date. Draco enjoyed the exchange of letters, but they still had to be sure to communicate in Ancient Runes, and putting an entire message into Ancient Runes took significant time, even for a genius.

And on the topic of Ancient Runes, Draco was also trying to figure out the rest of the Persian dialects, although that particular project of his was getting pushed to the back shelf with his Head Boy duties, not to mention the fact that he still had Quidditch to worry about.

The Slytherin team was not going to keep him for captain, even though last year it was pretty much a given that he would succeed Warrington, but now it wasn't likely that they would even put him in a position. That thought hit him rather hard. He loved to fly, and merely circling the castle on his free time did not equal the excitement of a game, especially a game against Potter, seeing as Potter was the only boy in school who could best him.

Quidditch was a great stress reliever as well. It allowed him to release all of his pent up energy, well, that and shagging, though he doubted Pansy would really like to dally with him now. But still, Pansy said that she was going into politics, which meant that she wasn't thrilled with Voldemort, so maybe there was hope for him after all. Merlin, he hoped there was. He was not a sex-crazed male, but he was a teenaged boy, and the prospect of being celibate for the year was not an appealing thought.

There was a knock on the common room door and Draco looked up. It was Wednesday after classes and he wasn't expecting anyone. He wondered if it was for Hermione and called out "Come in" rather testily, and at his command the door swung open and Laney stepped in. Draco was immediately on the alert, checking her over for any signs that something had happened, that someone had done something to her.

"I can't do my Transfigurations," said Laney, holding up her book and parchment.

Draco relaxed marginally, though he finished his check of his niece. She was wearing just the skirt and sweater part of the uniform and her hair was wet and combed away from her face. She had obviously just taken a shower as her skin looked scrubbed pink.

"Transfigurations?" he asked, and then motioned for her to bring the book to him. She looked very much relieved that he was going to help and quickly joined him, setting down the offending essay and book on the table, kneeling beside his chair.

"How's school?" asked Draco, picking up the essay and reading the prompt and then what she had so far.

Another thing he was responsible for: looking after Laney. While that was hardly any problem because Laney was quite capable and had a good amount of friends, Draco was still worried for her. It couldn't be easy, having an uncle who was the talk of the school, and a hated figure. Laney didn't seem to mind; she'd even told a few students off for spreading rumors about him. Still, that just meant she might anger the wrong people.

"It's alright," said Laney. "I hate Potions though. That man is so mean."

Draco made a mental note to speak to Snape. "How about everyone else?"

"I love Care for Magical Creatures," said Laney. "Last class, Professor Hagrid let us see the Unicorns he was showing to his fifth year students. They were really pretty."

"Mmm," said Draco, noncommittally. He didn't really like animals, besides dragons and thestrals, well, and Buckbeak, but he didn't want to put a damper on Laney's enthusiasm. He picked up Laney's book next and flipped to page thirty-eight, knowing that the information she needed was there. He had read this particular book twice and that meant he could probably come close to reciting the book word for word, even though he hadn't read it since he was younger than Laney.

"Here it is," he told his niece, holding the book so she could see it. "This is where it describes the difference from changing an object into another as opposed to turning it back into its original form."

Once Laney read over the passage, and after Draco explained the fundamentals to her, she seemed to understand, but Draco still kept an eye on her as she wrote.

There was another knock on the door and Draco glared.

"Come in."

Ginny Weasley stepped into the room, spotting Laney and waving.

"Hey, Laney," she said, sitting across the table from them. "How are you?"

Draco scowled at her, but Laney was already replying.

"Uncle Draco's helping me with Transfigurations because I was confused."

Ginny groaned sympathetically. "I actually came to see Hermione for help with Transfigurations too, but I'm more than confused, I'm downright lost. I hate that class."

She made a face and Laney giggled, then rolled up the essay she was now done with.

"Could you braid my hair again, Nevra?" she asked.

"Sure," said Ginny.

They had obviously done this before, because Laney handed Ginny a hair tie and then knelt on the floor in front of her. Ginny brushed through her hair a few times with her fingers, and then proceeded to gather up the top layer of Laney's hair and separated it into three parts.

"So," said Ginny, addressing Laney, "Uncle Draco can't braid hair?"

"Of course not," Laney laughed. "He's a boy."

"Boys can braid hair," said Ginny. "My older brother Bill used to braid my hair all the time when I was little."

"No, he didn't," said Laney in the tones of a child who is sure that a grown-up is merely pulling their leg.

"No, I'm serious," said Ginny. "He could do regular braids, French braids, and four and five braids. I bet he could even do a French twist."

"He really did your hair?"

"Every morning when I was little, well, every morning he wasn't at school. He and mum used to fight over who would do my hair because I was the only girl, so I was the only one with hair long enough to do. Although, now Bill grew his hair out too, so he braids his own."

Laney seemed unconvinced. "Well, how did he know how to braid?"

"My mum taught him. Boys don't pick it up really fast but they can learn. I bet even your Uncle Draco could learn."

"But braiding is a girl thing and Uncle Draco's a boy."

"Yes, he is. But I bet he'd be good at it. What do you say, Draco?"

Draco looked up. Why the hell was the Weaslette talking to him? His suspicion must have showed in his face because Ginny laughed.

"Oh, come on. Your niece just said that boys can't braid hair. Aren't you going to defend the male race from this blatant stereotype?"

"I think the male race will survive," said Draco dryly, turning back to his book.

"You know," said Ginny, whispering conspiratorially to Laney , "I think he's afraid of failure. Tragic, really. Won't even try new things because he thinks he won't succeed."

She was baiting him, deliberately. It was something some other girls might do to flirt with him, but surely not the Weaselette? He studied her with narrowed eyes. Her hair was slightly curly, pulled back in a pony tail, and she had on her skirt, shirt, and sweater from the uniform. Her eyes were the same shade of hazel as Bill's, and they seemed to have the same sparkle of perpetual cheerfulness, though there was something darker behind the depths.

It was that glimpse of shadow that intrigued him, and Laney was looking at him expectantly, so he relented, moving to the spot beside the Gryffindor girl on the couch. He, of course, already knew how to braid, but he had never braided hair before, or learned to French braid, like Ginny was doing now.

"See," she said. "It's relatively simple. The one on the edge goes over the middle one, and then the other side goes over the middle. Because this is a French braid, we take in more hair before each cross."

He didn't just watch the pattern; he watched her fingers, which ones held the strands and which ones were free to gather new hair. She was obviously experienced in the matter of hair styles because her fingers worked flawlessly through the damp strands.

"Alright," she said, undoing her work, "your turn."

It was much different, actually braiding the hair then watching it. He followed her moves exactly, and did a passable job, although, for fear of pulling to hard, his braid came out rather loose.

"Not bad," said Ginny, once he had finished. She took the braid and wrapped the hair tie around it as she looked over his work with a critical eye. "Although I think you must have braided before."

"I trust I have successfully defended my fellow men then?" he asked.

"Or just proved that you have a few girly tendencies," Ginny agreed.

Draco raised an eyebrow, daring her to elaborate. She didn't, but it wasn't necessary with her smile.

The door opened then, and Draco had to turn to see who it was. Hermione entered the room, raising her eyebrows at the two of them sitting next to each other.

"Is there something you two want to tell me?" she asked.

Draco glared; Ginny rolled her eyes.

He moved back to his seat on the armchair that gave him complete view of the entire room. He was like a veteran Auror, always needing to be able to keep tabs on everyone, not allowing anyone to sneak up behind him.

Laney left after that, giving him a kiss goodnight on the cheek and then leaving with her books. Draco would have walked her back, but he knew that the halls leading to Gryffindor tower were watched by McGonagall at this time of night. Besides, if there were a few Gryffindors heading back as well, it would just make things awkward. He didn't want to cast a shadow on Laney's life more than there always was with the last name Chalmers-Malfoy.

His hand subconsciously drifted up to touch the spot on his cheek that Laney had kissed after the door swung shut behind her. For some reason he felt that a cold person like him couldn't be unaffected by the kiss of a child. He felt as if the anointed site should begin to crack, or the ice layers should peel away, but it was always the same: no change, just a small tingle.

He spotted motion in his peripheral vision and he looked up to see both Ginny and Hermione making cute faces at him.

"That was so sweet," said Ginny, and he knew that she wasn't entirely joking.

Hermione looked as if she was going to comment too, so he pointedly looked back to his book.

Being a genius has his advantages. It meant that he could read the book on Conceptual Potions and listen to the conversation between Hermione and the Weaselette. It was normally a trait that came in handy, but the only subject the conversation was centered around was Transfigurations and the littlest Weasley's complete incomprehension.

"Ugghhh!" Ginny groaned a while later, throwing down her quill and sprawling on the couch. "Maybe I'll just drop it."

Hermione was scandalized. "Drop Transfigurations?" It was uttered as if Ginny had just suggested she break into the Magical Museum of Artifacts and Antiques and snap the staff of Merlin.

Ginny rolled her eyes. "Yes, drop Transfigurations. It's not as if I need it."

Hermione frowned. "I thought you wanted to be an Auror."

"Bloody hell!" Ginny exclaimed.

Draco actually looked up at the exclamation, eyebrow rising in surprise at the outburst.

"Why does everyone think that I want to be an Auror?" asked Ginny. "Every time the subject comes up, it's always 'You want to be an Auror, don't you Ginny?' I just don't get it!"

She paused, brow furrowing before she spoke again, turning to Hermione with her nose wrinkled up. "It's because of Harry, isn't it? Because everyone still thinks I have a sodding crush on him and am going to follow him, like a lost puppy, to the end of the world." She heaved a sigh of annoyance and slouched even further on the couch.

Hermione looked as if she wanted to laugh, but she swallowed the amusement for the sake of her friend. "Well then what do you want to be?"

"I want to go into law," said Ginny, sitting up, apparently much relieved that Hermione was taking her seriously. "I haven't decided exactly what yet, but I'm thinking prosecutor for the Ministry so that Death Eaters stop getting off with a bribe. It doesn't do the Aurors any good if the criminals they do capture are released the next day without so much as a hearing."

"Law," mused Hermione. "I think it would suit you, but I thought you needed Transfigurations for that."

Ginny shook her head. "There isn't any required classes for going into a law apprenticeship, but the more NEWTs you get, the better chance you have of getting picked up by someone good. I could still drop Transfiguration and take NEWT Muggle Studies or something."

"You could," Hermione agreed. "Will you?"

"No," said Ginny. "I'm too stubborn, so will you start from the top, one more time?"

Draco went to bed soon after, or rather, to his room so that he could concentrate on his book. He liked his room. It was large, comfortable, and done in peaceful shades of green and mahogany with off-white accents. It was also quite soundproof, meaning that Draco did not have to cast a silencing charm on his bed curtains at night, which was a pleasant change.

He went to bed at eleven, an hour quite early for him, but when he woke up in the morning, he was still tired. Hermione noticed it as well, though he doubted anyone else would.

"You look exhausted," the Gryffindor girl told him, joining him at the table for her morning tea. This time it was peach and passion fruit.

"Went to bed late," said Draco, shrugging off her concern with a lie.

"You always go to bed late," said Hermione. "You should try a sleep aid."

Draco made a noncommittal noise and kept browsing through the newspaper.

By the time his morning classes were over, he was seriously annoyed at his lack of status in the school. McGonagall had taken points off because of a note passed by another Slytherin, who only had to claim it was him. The teacher was all too eager to deduct points, no doubt trying to make up for lost time.

There was an incident in the hallway as well. Ravenclaws, this time. Really, everyone always assumed that the Slytherins were the only Death Eaters in the school. What they didn't realize was that if you took away those students who had Death Eater parents, the majority of those who were joining without family pressure were mostly Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.

The incident this time consisted of a few choice words from the pack of seventh year Ravenclaws, and his own witty, yet cutting, remark. He was penalized. Detention actually, with McGonagall, as she was the one who overheard his retort.

During lunch his meal exploded in his face. He should have seen it coming; the warning signs were all there, but he was frustrated, and he didn't think they would stoop to anything quite that childish. The Great Hall immediately burst into laughter at the sight of Draco Malfoy covered in various entrees, pumpkin juice staining his hair orange. For a split second, he had the urge to hex Nott within an inch of his life. His mind had already catalogued excatly what dark curses he could get away with, and what hexes weren't illegal yet. Those were the ones he had invented himself. The Ministry couldn't ban what they didn't know existed.

His hand was already gripping his wand when the rational, logical, genius side of him caught up with his rage and checked his actions. He let go and merely wiped his face with the cloth napkin and tossed it onto the remains of his plate. A cleaning charm later and he was instantly removed of his lunch and then he met Nott's gaze and raised an eyebrow. He jerked his head towards the door and then left, waiting outside for Nott to join him. Nott did, with Crabbe and Goyle as well as three Ravenclaws, all seventh years. They were the ones who had insulted him on the stairs, no, they had insulted his family. No one ever dared to do that before.

"Well, Draco," drawled Nott, in a poor imitation of Draco's droll tones, "how are you finding the life of a traitor?"

"I should ask you how you are finding the life of a lapdog," countered Draco, occupying his mind with tapping out the pattern as slowly as possible. The desire to lash out was strong. "And to a Half-blood too. How low can you stoop, Theodore?"

"Not as low as you have fallen, traitor," sneered Nott. "You will pay. When the Dark Lord rises to power, with the faithful as his generals, you will pay ten times over."

"I thought the faithful were mere servants. Congratulations on the promotion."

"I don't like your attitude, Draco. And I'm sure that the Dark Lord would find it most upsetting as well."

"Ah, yes, the Dark Lord," said Draco. "However that is a personal matter between him and me. No doubt he will wish to speak to me about it, yes? Once he gets here, that is."

The last was said in a mocking tone of voice, even though Draco remembered Nott speaking of how the Dark Lord was going to pay the Mud-bloods a visit. He was hoping Nott would tell him more, if the Dark Lord would actually show up, if it was actually possible, but Nott didn't. Instead the larger, stronger boy grabbed his arm and hauled him down an abandoned hallway.

"When you insult out lord, you insult us as well," said Nott, releasing him with a shove that sent him back a couple of steps before he regained his balance. "And I don't like being insulted."

He stepped forward menacingly and the others advanced as well, backing Draco slowly into the dead end of the hall. Draco slipped his hand inside his robe pocket and gripped his wand. He would retaliate, but only when his revenge could be gained with actions that would appear to be self-defense.

"And you know what else, I don't like?" Nott asked. "I don't like how you act so special. I don't like how you lorded yourself over us since first year because 'Oh, my father this and my father that'. Well, guess what? He's not here right now, and he never will be because you have no family now. Not besides your weak little Half-blood niece."

"Watch it, Nott," Draco warned coolly. "Or I just might lose it." He was close to losing it as well, losing the control that reigned in his anger, his frustration from the entire week, from the entire school year. Students laughing at him, pranking him, whispering and pointing, asking stupid questions, goading each other on.

Nott snorted. "What are you going to do, Draco? Threaten me to death? You've done nothing but hide behind your family name for your entire life. Well, you don't have that name anymore. And your precious little niece doesn't deserve it either. She's no better than a Mudblood. Your father should have killed her the day she was born, her and that Muggle whore."

Draco bristled at that comment. He didn't know Sam very well, but she was nothing like his mother. She was not a whore.

"I would add in your brother on that statement," said Nott, "but I already know that he's dead. Your grandmother, right? She could see what the bastard was really like, what a failure, not worthy of the pure blood that ran in his veins. Like yourself."

Nott pulled out his wand and leveled it at Draco's head.

"I've been practicing my Cruciatus, just for this occasion, to use on you. You're father was too weak to see that his bastard son was a blood traitor, not even worthy to be killed the wizards way. He was too weak to take care of the problem himself, too weak to do away with you as well."

Draco's self-control was slipping and he sneered at Nott, his hand ready to pull at his wand at any moment.

"And I suppose you are proud of the fact that your father would kill you without a moment's hesitation?"

"My father is loyal to the Dark Lord, as am I. We will serve his every command. I will enjoy carrying out this order most especially. Cruci-,"

Draco wand was out in an instant, slashing through the air in a hard jerk, causing a flash of too-bright light and a deafening crack! He did not yell the curse, or even speak it, even though his mind was screaming in rage. He could vaguely hear the part of him that exalted in his power, the Lord Draco part, shouting in triumph, though for a moment, he couldn't understand why.

He understood the instant his eyes had recovered from the near-blinding light. The curse he used was an old one, and ancient one that created a shockwave of magic to be expelled from the wand with the force of a gunshot. It used more force than was necessary for this situation, but even as he surveyed the aftereffects, he knew that the results of the curse was four times more destructive then it should have been.

The six boys had been thrown half-way down the hall, and they were tangled together, unmoving. The doors leading off from the hall were caved in, the rooms in shambles with turned over desks and cracked chalkboards. In the hall, tapestries had tumbled to the ground and the few windows that were glass-paned had shattered. The stones that created the walls of the hallway were cracked in some places as well, dust and chunks of rock strewn across the floor.

He had done this. He had lost control, given into the temptation to unleash his power. He walked forward, wand still in his hand, though at his side. He stood over the six boys, noting that they were all still breathing, but then he saw another form protruding from a doorway further on. He frowned and stepped forward, a growing feeling of dread as he discovered what the form was. It was a cat, more specifically a tabby cat with markings around the eyes that looked like spectacles. He knew who it was. It was Minerva McGonagall, Transfigurations Professor, Head of Gryffindor House, and Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts, currently lying unconscious on the floor in her animagus form.

Merde. He was a dead man.

He looked up as footsteps came pounding towards him and then Professors Snape, Sprout, and Lupin rounded the corner. They pulled up short at the sight of Draco standing over the bodies. They were followed by Hermione Granger and most of the student population.

Immediately the whispers and exclamations started.

"Sweet Merlin, are they dead?"

"Malfoy killed someone?"

"What happened? I can't see!"

Draco watched as Snape and Lupin went about checking the bodies. His gaze was cold, hidden behind his frosty mask, though inside he was mentally calculating the chances of expulsion.

He watched as the students fell silent and stepped aside to admit Dumbledore who was humming slightly and eating a croissant left over from lunch. He raised his eyebrows at the scene before him and then looked up at Draco with twinkling eyes. He didn't say anything to him though, instead he turned to Hermione.

"Miss Granger, could you please direct the students back to their classes? Pomona, if you would please fetch Madame Pomfrey?"

"No need," exclaimed the medi-witch, pushing her way through the crowd. "I heard the explosion from the infirmary." She set about examining the unconscious students and then having the teachers whisk them up to the infirmary on floating stretchers.

The students finally began dissipating when Hermione threatened to give any stragglers detention and then Nott was finally carted off. Dumbledore had already spotted McGonagall's cat form and he motioned Pomfrey over.

"Oh, my," said Pomfrey. "I'll see to her right away." And then the witch was scooping up the cat and leaving Draco alone with Dumbledore.

Draco turned to Dumbledore who was chewing the last of his lunch and then brushing crumbs off of his beard and robes.

"Come up to my office, Draco," he said.

Draco nodded, and followed the Headmaster wordlessly up to the tower office, his cool façade wrapped tightly around his body though inside he was tensed, strained, waiting to hear his punishment for attacking six students and members of the faculty. He sat in the overstuffed chair, his fingers flying in the 1-3-2-4 pattern as he waited for Dumbledore.

The Headmaster seemed to be drawing the suspense out purposefully, because he slowly sat in his chair and then turned his blue eyes on Draco and then leisurely leaning back.

"So," he said finally, his eyes twinkling down on Draco, "I don't suppose you quite expected the results of that curse?"

Draco felt his cheeks turn the lightest shade of pink.

"The curse is one I have used before."

"But not with results quite like that?"

His cheeks were now an official shade of carnation. "No," he allowed. The last time he had used the curse he had only flung a few bookshelves to the wall. It had not taken pieces out of a building.

"As Head Boy, you, of course, know that we do not tolerate altercations in this school, so you will receive a detention with Professor Snape tonight. That's all; you are free to return to class."

The Headmaster smiled at him and Draco stared for a moment.

"I rendered six students unconscious." He didn't make it a question.

"Yes, you did. However you, Draco, are not a fool. I trust that one of them was about to attack you?"

"Nott was going to try out his Cruciatus," Draco confirmed, wondering why he had gotten off so lightly.

"While we do not tolerate fighting, we do promote self-defense, so a detention with Severus."

"I caused rather extensive damage to school property."

Dumbledore waved it off. "I once had a student cause rather spectacular damage in my office at the end of fifth year. He, like yourself, was…letting off steam. I have no doubt that you will be doubly careful to reign in your emotions next time you come into a conflict, especially as you are trying to keep that particular strength of yours discreet for the time being."

Draco was thoroughly flummoxed by now. It was as if the man had no desire to punish him and he couldn't, for the life of him, understand why. Dumbledore was smart enough to know that letting him off wouldn't convince him to join the Order or agree to anything else, so why-?

"I knocked out McGonagall. I attacked a teacher!"

Dumbledore's eyes lost a bit of their twinkle. "You did," he allowed. "However, I tried to persuade Minerva that her interference would not be necessary when she saw the group of you leave the Great Hall. Spying on students in hopes to discover a way to incriminate them is not something we promote at Hogwarts. No doubt, if she had made herself known this incident would have been avoided."

Draco nodded. He knew McGonagall did not have the best of opinions of him, and he knew that Dumbledore was aware of the fact. By admitting it, Dumbledore was trying to appear open and honest with him, and to also assure Draco that he was aware of the problem.

"I had a detention with Professor McGonagall this evening as well," said Draco. "I assume that I will serve that detention once she is recovered?"

"That will not be necessary," said Dumbledore. "Your detention with Snape will serve as both."

Draco frowned, his grey eyes clouding over and his fingers speeding up their pattern as they usually did when he came across something he couldn't quite grasp. Dumbledore gave him that kind smile again, the one that was faintly disconcerting because it seemed to Draco that the old man was reading his mind.

"You did nothing wrong, my boy. While there were better ways to have handled the situation, that does not mean that you made an error. The best of us have had a curse go awry, and we have all lost control, and no doubt will again before our time. Just because you are smarter than the average wizard does not mean you aren't subjected to ordinary slips. Besides, if you don't gather the gollywort tonight for the Veritaserum, you'll have to order in. The ache in my left knee tells me that there is a severe frost coming soon."

Draco blinked, but then nodded. "Very well, Headmaster," he said. He got up to leave but Dumbledore stopped him at the door.

"Be careful that you aren't spreading yourself to thin," the Headmaster said. "Marmalade only goes so far on toast. The same can be said with genius."

Draco nodded again and left, and this time, when he walked through the halls, people moved out of his way. He rewarded them all with his best glare, his wand arm held loose by his side and his fingers twitching, as if itching to hex more students. Those who passed him paled and hurried away.

Draco merely smirked, making a note to himself. The best way to go about reclaiming respect? Taking out six students and letting the entire school population see the after effects. Then, let them all know that you are only receiving one detention, and that, huh, has anyone seen McGonagall? Is she really in the infirmary with the other boys?

Oh, yes. It was good to be back.

There was an incident.

Bill frowned as he read those words, his eyes skipping back to the other letter he held in his hands, the one that bore the official Hogwarts crest.

Dear Parent or Guardian,

This is a notice from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Your child/ward was recently involved in a brawl on school grounds. Being involved in such activities is against the student code of conduct and severely frowned upon and as such your child/ward, Draco Lucius Malfoy, will be serving 1 (one) detention with Professor Severus Snape, the Slytherin Head of House.

At Hogwarts we believe that parental/guardian involvement in our student's life is a good way to insure the proper upbringing of all adolescents and we encourage you to speak with your child/ward about the events that transpired. Any comments or questions are welcomed and can be addressed to Hogwarts.

Sincerely,

Albus Dumbledore

Bill put that letter down and turned to the other one.

William,

There was an incident. As you have taken it upon yourself to act as Draco's guardian, I felt that you should be notified of the events that took place today. Draco was involved in a brawl at school when he was accosted by six other students who have connections to Death Eaters or the Dark Arts. He is unharmed; however, the spell he used against them in self-defense was magnified quite significantly by unsettled emotions. As Draco is more comfortable speaking with you, I felt it best if you should inquire after his well being as he is no doubt under a great deal of pressure.

Rest assured, besides this one incident, I believe he is doing quite well.

Sincerely,

Albus Dumbledore

Bill was very adept at reading in between the lines and he could piece together the story. Draco was accosted by Death Eaters or Death-Eaters-soon-to-be, and being a genius and a very powerful wizard, he had taken all of them out without injury to himself.

Bill was not worried about that part of the story. He knew that facing such adversaries would be a common occurrence for Draco, but he also knew the blond could handle himself. What was worrying was the fact that Dumbledore mentioned that the curse Draco used was fueled by emotions.

Draco did not express his feelings outwardly, and while he himself admitted that he was emotionally unavailable, that did not mean that he was unaffected by pressure or stress. He had bottled it up instead, and although he had been doing so for most of his life, something had happened to set him off, to make him slip and lose control. Draco was lucky he hadn't killed anyone.

Bill sighed, frowning as he stared at the parchment on his desk. He did need to speak with Draco about this, or rather, write to Draco, but it was hard to know what might push the boy away. Dealing with Draco was like dealing with a fine-tuned instrument. The slightest nudge could send the whole thing askew.

He settled for the blunt, honest approach, knowing that such an opening was still unfamiliar with Draco, which might throw him slightly off guard and have him reveal more than he usually would.

He picked up his quill and wrote swiftly.

Draco,

I just received a letter from Dumbledore citing news of some sort of brawl and a curse that went awry. You are unharmed, right? Write back and let me know.

Bill

He nodded as he read the short message over. No doubt Draco would be slightly annoyed that Bill seemed to be worrying abut him, but that also meant he would feel obligated to relieve those tensions as they were of his doing. He sent the letter off by owl.

The reply came a day later as international owl mail was quite proficient, even if it was expensive. Bill didn't mind; the Ministry was reimbursing him.

He opened the letter that was addressed to him in Draco's perfect calligraphy. The ink was a dark green that was almost black and the letter was written on fine white parchment.

Bill,

I am unharmed, so you can stop worrying else you'll give yourself grey hair, though upon further reflection, it would no doubt be an improvement.

The 'brawl' that Dumbledore wrote to you of did not even deserve the name. Nott started to hex me, and I was faster. End of story.

The curse that went 'awry' was mine. I was angered by certain things that Nott said and so was not careful to keep the curse in check. While such an event is not typical of my spell work, it is a one time occurrence that is in no way a mirror of any 'inner turmoil' or unresolved conflicts that you no doubt believe I need to deal with. Tell Dumbledore I don't need a snitch next time he writes, would you?

Draco Malfoy

Bill didn't know whether to laugh at the letter or to groan in frustration. Being a genius meant that Draco felt he needed no looking after, that he would be equipped to handle any problems he encountered because he was able to identify and categorize them. Draco seemed to forget that he was only seventeen years old. In the Muggle world, he would still be dependent on his parents, and even most wizards and witches stayed with their parents while in apprenticeships until they were at least twenty-two.

He pulled out a piece of parchment and wrote a reply.

Draco,

It seems to me you do need a Snitch, unless of course you plan on forfeiting all of the Quidditch games. And Dumbledore is merely concerned about you, which is a good thing because it stops me from worrying so much. As for a lack of inner turmoil, weren't you the one that said trying to psychoanalyze oneself leads to erroneous diagnosis because there are certain things you would disregard? I suggest that, if you don't wish me to catch the nearest Portkey to Hogsmeade to see for myself if you are alright, you might care to elaborate on why your spell went wrong. In regards to grey hair, I suppose that's one thing you won't have to worry about, seeing as your hair is so close to silver already. Take care,

Bill

The response came half a day later.

You wouldn't.

He wrote his reply equally quickly.

I can catch a Portkey for tomorrow evening. Are you free then? I was thinking we might catch a cup of coffee and you can tell me what this is all about.

The reply was somewhat defeated.

If you must know, Nott said some rather unsavory remarks about certain members of my family, both the legitimate and the illegitimate. As many of the students in my house are aware of my lack of certain loyalties, they have attempted to threaten me and have served to be quite the annoyance. Due to that aggravation and combined with Nott's insults, I neglected to take proper caution in insuring that my curse was separate from any agitation I may have been feeling and so the curse was amplified. I also neglected to hold the curse back to the level of others of my age, and that as well, caused the curse to cause more damage than intended.

He wrote another letter.

So, you snapped. It's alright to admit it, Draco; no one's perfect. Besides, shouldn't you be truthful with a friend?

The reply was somewhat caustic, but not derogatory.

Very well. I, using your common slang, snapped. Happy?

Very much so. Don't you feel better now that you've come to terms with that fact?

I hardly believe that defining my actions in laymen's terms is about to set me onto the road of self-discovery and healing.

So you accept the fact that you need to heal then?

This reply took a little longer to come. Bill could almost picture Draco falling silent at his letter, his fingers going off in his pattern, his eyes iced over, but not necessarily in anger. He knew that if it had been anyone else who had asked, Draco would be angry, but not Bill. No, Draco liked him.

When the letter came, he eagerly ripped it open.

I suppose. I don't think that there are any serious emotional wounds in my psyche that I need to worry about. Inconsistencies, perhaps. Areas that may need improvement, but healing, not the word I would use. And before you get all proud of yourself, I was already aware of this. Sorry. No moments of startling clarity because of your stimulating conversation.

Bill grinned at that. No, he didn't think his letter would cause enlightenment, but he liked to be a reminder to Draco. He knew that it must take a lot of effort to actually change Draco's ways, and that if he didn't rag the Slytherin about it, Draco would merely get caught up in a hundred other things that he needed to do and wouldn't bother to help himself. Bill knew that working on Draco was much more important than anything Draco might be preoccupied with. He sent out another letter.

That's alright. And I'm always here to help.

That letter didn't get a reply. It didn't need one; Bill could already picture the eye roll accompanied by a sneer and a slight shake of the white-blond head, and he just smiled.

Next chapter is up sooner, I promise. And as I was in a car accident, you all have to be nice and review. Ha!





11. Of Dates and Dances

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, although I do own a really sore hand from writing this huge essay for a theology test. It figures that I said I would update on Mondays forgetting about the huge exam which I pulled an almost all-nighter for. But, I shall stave off sleep, until this chapter is up for you amazing reviewers.

However, because of lack of sleep, I am replying to specific reviews, not all cuz I need to go to bed.

Kasiuke: yeah, I was driving through a snow storm on the highway and off-roaded into a tree. The car isn't exactly living, but it will be soon. Thank you for your concern and review!

Lilith: ooo, I love the French language, and the 'snap, crackle, pop' comment, lol.

GREMLIN: lol, I'm happy I wasn't maimed too!

Sabireru: Yes, they will find out, but not soon.

Drewberry: yeah, I was freaked. I didn't stop shaking until three hours later, lol.

Spyrit: It's a good thing to make people laugh, well, as long as they're no laughing at you I suppose….

And thanks to: Bena24, Anna, R2D2, Wolf, nomanslander, dbi626, slickslytherin

That's alright. And I'm always here to help.

Draco read Bill's letter and rolled his eyes, a sneer painted on his face and he shook his head ever-so-slightly. Really, the Gryffindor was too…good. It was sickening.

He looked up as Hermione came through the dormitory door and stalked up to him, hands crossed across her chest.

"The Halloween dance," she said.

Draco groaned. Speak of sickening…

"None of that," scolded Hermione, sitting in her armchair and pulling out a notebook. "It's a week and a half until Halloween and we need to let people know what the theme is going to be so they can get costumes during the next Hogsmeade trip."

"I hate dances," said Draco.

"Stop whining. Do you at least have any ideas for a theme?"

"Halloween?" asked Draco, just to be difficult because he really wasn't any good at this type of thing.

"Real cute," said Hermione, rolling her eyes. "Come on, something romantic. You've had enough girlfriends to be able to do romantic."

"I didn't do the romantic; I did the girls," said Draco bluntly.

Hermione looked shocked at the crude words and Draco sighed.

"Well, what do you think is romantic?" he asked.

Hermione thought for a minute. "Flowers, chocolate, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Romeo and Juliet, Cupid and Psyche, going out to the movies, long walks on the beach and what not. It's not really Halloweenish, though. I suppose we could do a Shakespeare themed party, at least that way people could dress up."

Draco shook his head. "Generalize it," he said. "Romeo and Juliet is thought to be romantic because their families were enemies, or 'opposites', so have an opposite themed night."

Hermione looked intrigued. "That would work," she said. "You could have a fairy and a knight, a princess and a peasant, or even simple things like night and day, black and white, the moon and the sun. I like it."

"Muggle-lover and Death Eater," muttered Draco.

That earned him a dark look from Hermione and he shrugged apologetically.

"So, are we good now?" he asked.

"Not nearly," she said. "We have to plan the menu and decorations and music and what not."

"I came up with the idea though. Isn't that good enough?"

"No," said Hermione. "Now, help me think. What are some good snacks to have at this thing?"

It took far longer than Draco would have liked. He never really enjoyed parties all that much and planning one was even worse. He figured that working with Hermione Granger just took it one step further. She was a perfectionist and every little detail had to be planned.

Draco went to bed at one o'clock that night, only to get up at five so that he could add another ingredient to the Veritaserum that had to be stirred in with the first rays of dawn.

Snape snorted at his haggard appearance and choice of clothing, his loose cotton pajama pants and a black sweater, but Draco really wasn't planning on running into anyone.

"Should I inquire about your apparel or not?" he asked, pushing the cutting board over to Draco and letting him slice the dragon fly wings into miniscule bits.

"Granger and the Halloween Dance," said Draco wryly.

"Ah," said Severus. "My sympathies then."

Draco could only nod his head to that; as Head Boy he had to attend the dance and he was not looking forward to it. He changed the subject.

"I understand that the Death Eaters have been lying low," he said.

Snape raised an eyebrow. "Do you expect me to answer?" he asked. "I believe that Dumbledore said if you wished to ask any more questions of me, he was to be present."

"I am aware of the same things you are," said Draco. "I just wanted your opinion of it."

"And how are you aware of the happenings of the Death Eaters?" asked Snape.

Why else would I join a Ministry run operation except to keep tabs on them? thought Draco, aside from the fact that Bill asked him to, of course.

"I have sources," said Draco.

"Then I suggest you consult those sources and not me," said Snape. "I work for the Order, not for you."

"You mean you work for Dumbledore."

"If I had meant that, I would have said it."

"You tend not to say things you mean."

"And in this instance you aren't reading between the lines properly."

"You don't like most of the Order members. I can hardly see you admitting that you work for them."

"I work with the Order members for the Order and for the same goal."

"Even though you don't get along with them."

"It is not necessary that we be the best of friends."

"But it must put some strain in the ranks, to work with them and them with you."

"It is as you say."

"And personal grudges aren't enough to keep you from the Order?"

Snape reached out and jarred the cutting board, just as Draco brought the knife down to cut. The blade slid over his finger, drawing a thin line of blood.

Draco dropped the knife and immediately pulled his hand away so he wouldn't contaminate the ingredients. He looked up at the Potions Master, eyes cold.

"Why did you cut your finger Draco?" asked Snape, calmly checking the dragonfly wings for any traces of blood.

"You jarred the board," said Draco.

"It couldn't be helped. There was a fly near the board and I had to ward it away so it wouldn't taint our potion. So again, why did you cut your finger?"

"Because you didn't tell me you were going to move the board."

"Exactly. No, I do not get along with all of the members of the Order, in fact, I get along with precious few of them. That, however, does not mean a thing. If we had been making another potion with poisonous ingredients that cut of yours could have been fatal, just as in my field of operation, a simple motion, such as the jarring of a board, could lead to death. We are working together to do something much more important than a mere potion, and because of that, personal grudges are set aside, and we do not make little slips out of spite. We have occasional spats during the meetings, but that is all."

Severus dumped the dragonfly wings into the cauldron just as the first rays of light spilled through the tiny windows that lined the top of the wall and stirred three times before setting the ladle down and looking at Draco.

"I trust that I have successfully answered the real question you were going to ask?"

He had. Draco wondered how Snape had known personal grudges were one of the reasons he wasn't keen on joining the Order. He wasn't about to join a group of people who hated his father, only to be sold out for a moment's revenge.

"I could have done without the object lesson," he allowed.

Snape smiled thinly. "But this way it is much more effective. Is there anything else you wished to ask?"

Draco shook his head, but then stopped. "Is it worth it?" he asked.

"I make much more of a difference in combining my efforts with others than I would hosting my own personal vendetta, so yes, small cuts on the finger I can bear."

Draco nodded. "Thank you, Professor," he said.

"I'll see you in Potions," said Snape. "And no bleeding during class, so get that finger fixed."

Draco nodded again and left to go get ready for class.

From the excited talk about the posters that Hermione and Draco had put up the day before, the theme of opposites was going to be a hit and already girls were discussing costumes with their less than enthusiastic boyfriends. Draco decided he would be most relieved when this whole thing was over.

Draco was not planning on taking anyone to the dance. He was going to show up, like his position demanded him to, and then he would leave to work on more translations with the Persian runes, seeing as he really hadn't had the opportunity to study them as much as he would like. At least, that was the plan until Ginny Weasley knocked on the dorm door Wednesday evening.

Draco was writing his Charms essay by the fire and had called out 'Come in' almost absently and then Ginny had appeared in the doorway with an enraged expression on her face.

Draco had not been expecting that and he had looked at the girl curiously.

"Is Hermione here?" Ginny asked, or rather, demanded.

"No," said Draco.

Ginny muttered an expletive under her breath that made Draco raise his eyebrow and then the girl was running a hand through her disheveled, tangled hair and looking as if she was about to cry. Draco grew somewhat alarmed because although he was a genius, he was a perfectly normal teenaged boy when it came to certain things, such as crying females.

"Do you want me to see if I can find her for you?" he asked, not because he cared but because he was looking for an excuse to get out of the room.

"No, it's fine. I'll just wait for her," said Ginny, sitting on the couch and grabbing at one of the throw pillows, clutching it tightly.

Draco sat on the edge of his seat, his fingers running rapidly through his pattern. What the hell did one do in the presence of a near-tears girl?

Ginny looked over at him and laughed, wiping at her eyes and taking a breath. "It's alright," she said. "I'm not going to burst into tears so you don't have to look so terrified."

"I'm not terrified," Draco said quickly, but Ginny laughed again.

"You looked like my brothers do whenever I start crying. The whole 'shit, what the hell do I do with the emotional female?' look."

"I resent that statement Weasley," said Draco, sitting back now that the red-headed girl looked calmer.

"No offense meant," said Ginny. She settled back and then immediately started blinking back tears again. She sat up suddenly. "Bloody hell," she said, scrubbing at her face. "I don't even know why I'm just sitting here with you like this. I just really need to talk to Hermione because," here there was a pause so she could sniff and blink some more, "there was this guy, Timmy Redding, and we sort of liked each other last year, but he wanted to wait until we were both older so that 'the relationship could last'."

Here Ginny laughed. "I can't believe I fell for that line. Honestly, what guy is that concerned with the future of a relationship at sixteen? Anyway, so we started dating this year, and he took me out a few times and we were going to go to the ball together, but guess who I found shoving his tongue down April Summer's throat in the library?"

Draco figured that question was rhetorical, so he just watched as the youngest Weasley ranted, her hands moving about for emphasis. The motion was rather fetching.

"And, I mean, they weren't even in the Charms section or the love potion section, which has an element of class. No, they were in the botanical section under the 'Organic Fertilizer' sign. And to think that I was actually going to go out with him. I mean, that practically screams trash right there, that and his whole 'I want to wait until we're both older so this relationship can last'. As if. You know what that translates into? Do you know what that means in guy speech?"

"I want to wait until your old enough to give me a good time in the sack?" asked Draco.

"Yes!" said Ginny. "That's it exactly and me, Ginevra Weasley, sole relationship advisor for all sixth year girls, fell for a cliché line from a pretty face."

She smacked her forehead in self reproach and flopped back onto the couch, squeezing the pillow tightly.

"I mean," she said, "his initials alone should have clued me in. Timmy Redding, Tom Riddle. Hello! Wake up Ginny and read the flashing neon lights."

Draco raised his eyebrow at the reference to the Dark Lord by his real name. He wasn't aware that it was really a well known fact, and he was surprised that a mere sixth year girl would have the gall to drop it like a passing reference to the Weird Sisters.

"Anyway," she said, "I need Hermione for some girl time and chocolate. So, aside from the sobbing wreck of a girl upsetting your study time with tears and drama, how has your day been?"

It was surprising how much Ginny seemed to be like Bill at that moment, having the ability to keep him completely off guard like that, not only by the abrupt subject changes, but by the fact that she actually seemed interested in his answer.

"Passable," he said.

"Pun intended?" she asked.

Draco blinked.

"Passable, as in 'alright' but can also be a referral to school grades?" she prodded, and then she laughed. "Never mind, I forgot who I was dealing with for a minute there."

Draco frowned. "What is that supposed to mean?"

"Well, you're the 'Ice Prince' and all. It means you don't crack jokes and you only find pleasure through the suffering and torture of innocent first year students," she said. "Everyone knows that."

"Yes, well unfortunately my position as Head Boy prevents me from engaging in my usual pastimes so I have to find my amusement somewhere else," he said dryly.

"Such as writing charms essays, of course," she said, gesturing to his book and parchment.

"Such as listening to the woes and tears of certain Gryffindor sixth year girl. Not quite as satisfying as the sobs of first years, but it will have to do."

She laughed again. Obviously it was some sort of a habit with her, laughing that is, but the sound wasn't grating to listen to.

The door opened then and Hermione came in with an armful of books.

"Ginny, what are you doing here?" the older girl asked.

"I need chocolate and tissues," said Ginny.

Hermione 'awwed' and put the books down and together the girls ascended the stairs, Hermione's arm around the shorter girl's shoulders.

Draco settled back once Granger's door had shut and tried to pull his mind back to the essay.

He had completed his essay and was starting to look over his rough schematics of the counter to the Veritaserum when Ginny came back down. Instead of leaving, however, she walked over to Draco and stopped in front of him.

"I have a proposal for you," she said.

He didn't even look up at her, but shifted the pages he was reading. "Shouldn't you be on one knee then?"

"I can go on two knees if you say yes," she said.

He jerked his head up at that. Did the girl honestly realize what innuendo she had just laced into her words?

He met her amused look that told him, yes, she was quite aware of what she just said.

"That was purely to get your attention and should not be taken seriously," she told him.

"I should hope not," he said. "Whatever would your brother say?"

"Ron?" she asked. "Well, what he doesn't know can't hurt him."

He was actually thinking of Bill. Did he realize that his little sister was talking like that?

"True," he assented, "now do continue. I have things that require my attention."

"Go to the Halloween Dance with me."

Draco blinked and then silently cursed the girl for constantly surprising him.

"Pardon?" he asked, just to stall for time because he had no idea how to react to this. The shock of having none other than Ginny Weasley ask him to the dance had startled him enough to put his thoughts in a jumble and he was desperately trying to straighten them out.

"Go to the dance with me," Ginny repeated. "You aren't going with anyone and my date cheated on me. I want to go to the dance with a hot guy just to make him jealous."

"Is that an attempt at flattery?" asked Draco.

"No, just stating the facts," said Ginny. "You'll know when I resort to flattery."

"And you think that I'm going to say yes because you think I'm 'hot'?"

"No. You're going to say yes because if you go with me you won't have to wear a costume."

Draco put his papers down and stared up at the girl. "And how's that?"

"I figure us going together is enough of an opposite," she said.

"A Weasley and a Malfoy?" he asked.

"I was thinking more along the lines of Muggle-lover and assumed Death Eater, but I figured that wouldn't really be politically correct."

He raised an eyebrow at that, and Ginny shrugged again.

"I'm going to dress up. I've got a really nice looking dress, so I figure you could just wear your school uniform and then we've got another opposite theme, a Malfoy not dressing up and a Weasley going over the top."

"It does have a certain appeal," he allowed.

"My dress also had some gold, so if you wore something green or silver then we have the whole Gryffindor and Slytherin theme going on as well."

He actually considered it, which surprised him, but he shook his head. "Not interested."

"Not interested in me or in going to the dance?" she asked.

"Both."

"Not good enough."

"What?"

"I said that's not good enough. At least come up with a good excuse besides 'I'm not interested'."

He sighed. "Fine. One: you are the Weasley brat. If I went with you there would be numerous attempts on my life by your violence happy brother. Two: I have a reputation to maintain, as do you. Three: It would be a trying experience for both of us. Four: I don't like dances. Five: I like older women. Is that good enough for you?"

"Are you going to listen to my reason now?"

"Your reasons?"

"The ones why you should go to the dance with me."

Draco bit back a groan of frustration. "No," he said, and raised his rough copy of the Veritaserum counter, prepared to go back to his work. To his surprise, Ginny grabbed them from his grasp and held them behind her back.

"Weasley, give them to me," said Draco.

"Not until you listen to my reasons."

Draco clenched his jaw and took a deep breath. "Fine."

She smiled. "Good. First of all, the idea that you are afraid of my brother is ridiculous, so there is no way that fearing your life is an excuse. As for upholding reputations, you have your reputation as a sex god to uphold, and going to the dance without a date is not going to help that at all. As for the idea that I have a reputation, well, I have an ex to get even with. And it won't be a trying experience because it's not like we have to be glued to each other's side, and it doesn't really matter if you don't like dances because as Head Boy, you have to go. Finally, a dance is a great place to meet your 'older women', and they'll like it even more if I'm with you."

"How do you come to that conclusion?" asked Draco.

Ginny shrugged. "I've had enough boyfriends to know that I'm pretty, and when I'm dressed up I can be quite good looking. Girls like it when men, who have hot dates, talk to them instead. You're one of the youngest boys in your grade, so you should be able to find some girls who are at least a few months older than you at the dance."

Draco was grudgingly impressed that the girl had a point, or rather, a few of them.

"Well?" she asked expectantly, tilting her head to the side and putting her hands on her hips.

Draco rolled his eyes, just to show that he wasn't interested. "Fine. I'll go with you."

"Good," said Ginny. "Meet me at the Gryffindor dorms at seven-ten on Friday. I want to make an entrance."

"Don't expect flowers, or anything else along those lines."

"Of course not. If you did, people might actually think you cared. Good night."

"Can't really say it has been."

She laughed. "Careful there, Draco. What about those reputations you were talking about? I don't think cracking jokes is really conducive to your aloof persona."

"I was trying for sardonic."

"You should try keeping a straighter face then. No one can take you seriously when you keep smiling like that."

She was teasing him, her hazel eyes bright as she did so and her long hair catching the fire light, throwing off glints of gold and scarlet. She looked quite alluring.

"I believe I mentioned that I had things to do. Certain things that you are still in possession of," said Draco pointedly, because he was angry with himself for thinking of the Weaselette as 'alluring'.

She handed over the papers without looking at them, and Draco found his impression of her rising a point at her respect for his privacy.

"Well, 'til the dance then," she said.

"'Til then," Draco agreed, nodding at her and then returning to his papers. He waited until she turned around and was walking to the door, and then looked up, frowning at her slight figure. He didn't understand her. The door closed behind her and he went back to his work.

"You and Ginny then?" asked Hermione.

Draco whipped his head around to see the Head Girl on the stairs, eyebrows raised.

"How long have you been there?" he asked, trying to appear unaffected.

"The whole time," said Hermione. "I didn't think you would say yes."

"Neither did I," said Draco.

Hermione studied him critically. "I suppose it goes without saying that if you toy with her, I will shove an entire deck of Exploding Snap cards down your throat?"

"First off, the idea of 'toying' with a Weasley is repulsive, secondly, there are no emotions involved, Granger. She wants back at an ex and I plead temporary insanity."

"Don't see why. You seem to get along with her."

"I what?"

Hermione shrugged. "What do you call bantering back and forth with each other?"

"Bantering is not a basis for 'getting along'."

"It is when the only other thing you do is sneer and insult. I say bantering is a definite step up."

"Go to bed, Granger. You're tired and not thinking clearly."

"Doesn't that describe you more? You just agreed to go to the dance with Ginny Weasley."

Draco grimaced, already regretting the decision, but he wouldn't back out, not now.

Hermione saw the grimace and was kind enough to leave without another comment at his expense. Draco waited until she was back in her room with the door shut before pulling out a piece of parchment. He hesitated before writing swiftly.

Bill had just returned from meeting with his contact when he saw the letter lying on the desk, having been dropped off by an express owl. He immediately recognized the perfect calligraphy and quickly pulled off his coat. He took the letter into his small den, sitting in his easy chair and then settling back, peeling open the seal. He could tell that Draco had been troubled, even before reading the contents, because the paper was indented slightly where the still-perfect calligraphy graced the parchment. It seemed Draco had pressed a little too hard with his quill when writing. Bill frowned and read the message.

Bill,

I'm taking your sister to the Halloween dance.

Bill blinked at the sentence, trying to take it in. He read it again, this time noticing the abruptness and realizing that Draco seemed just as shocked as he was. He read it over again, just to make sure his eyes weren't playing tricks on him. They weren't; he continued reading.

And before you get all protective, she asked me, and no, I have no idea what possessed her to do so. Does your family have a history of mental diseases?

From what I understand, her boyfriend cheated on her and she wished to show him up, although her choice for escort is somewhat baffling to me.

As I have no doubt that such shocking news will soon travel through a family such as yours, I thought it best to reassure you that I have no intentions whatsoever on your sister. It is only because I am, as Head Boy, forced to attend the dance, that I even considered taking your sister and it is only because she refused to take 'no' for an answer that I said 'yes'.

As the dance is on Halloween, now is the best time to inform me of any rules and/or guidelines that older brothers have for the companions of younger sisters, such as a curfew and ban on alcoholic beverages, assuming, of course, that you have no objections to your sister being in the company of a Slytherin, Malfoy, and assumed Death Eater for the evening. I do not believe that I have to remind you that, as of now, I am not in good graces on any side of the current factions, or that such ramifications should also be taken into account.

Perhaps you should write to your sister.

Draco L. Malfoy

Bill put the letter down once he had finished reading it and made himself a cup of tea. He then took the letter into his small den and made himself comfortable on the sofa. He read the letter again.

It almost seemed as if, towards the end, Draco was trying to ask him to talk Ginny out of going to the ball with him.

Like hell Bill was doing that.

For one thing, there was no way Bill wanted his little sister's dance ruined by a cheating boyfriend, and he was all for Ginny showing him up. Draco didn't seem to be aware of it, but he was a good-looking kid, more so than good-looking, especially now that his hair was no longer shaggy and that his wardrobe no longer consisted of all black. While he knew Draco would ever be the typical male's dream of rippling muscles, chiseled features, and with a rugged look, and although Draco's pale skin and hair was a contrast to the 'dark' part in tall, dark, and handsome, he was still perhaps one of the best looking students in the school. He had more of a beauty to him, than a 'cute' or typically masculine look, and while being beautiful may not be popular for teenaged boys, there was a magnetism about the pale features than drew attention to him. So yes, although Draco didn't realize it, Bill had no doubt that Ginny would show up her cheating ex very nicely.

Secondly, Bill did not want his sister to find a typical rebound guy. While Ginny was extremely level-headed, he was still reassured knowing that she would be going to the dance with a boy who would not put a move on her. Bill knew that Draco would be a perfect gentleman to his sister because he had told Bill in the letter that he would be. Draco did not break his word, and besides, he had told Bill last year that he did not get involved with girls like Ginny because they were innocent, and he didn't want to ruin that.

Lastly, he knew that Draco, in being a gentleman, would see that Ginny had a good, safe time. Although Draco was cold around the edges, and he could be down-right manipulative and calculating at times, without seeming to care for anyone around him, he was not intentionally cruel just to take pleasure out of someone else's pain. After all, Draco's mother cheated on his father constantly, he was sure to be kind to Ginny. Not only that, but Ginny was Bill's little sister, and Draco knew, first hand, how protective Bill could get.

Bill winced slightly when he remembered the row between him and Draco, and how he had acted, nearly pushing Draco right back to Voldemort. He could only be thankful that Draco had heard him out. He pulled his thoughts back to the situation at hand. Draco was taking Ginny to the dance.

Bill was honestly fine with it.

He would write a letter to Draco of course, and play the role of concerned older brother, just to make sure Draco wasn't too short with Ginny at the dance. He wanted her to have a good time.

He sat back, intending to finish his tea and then write a reply, but then another owl flew in with a letter.

This one, he could tell by the slanted writing, was from Ginny.

Bill,

Don't freak.

He wasn't going to. He had a feeling he knew what this letter was going to say.

Promise?

Good.

I'm going with Draco Malfoy to the Halloween Dance.

Before you go all over-protective, you should know that I asked him. I even debated with him why he should go to the dance with me and he finally gave in when he realized I wasn't going to accept a 'no'.

No, I haven't lost my mind. Actually, I probably could plead temporary insanity because I found my boyfriend snogging another girl in the library. There is no way I'm going to let him ruin the dance for me, so I found a hot substitute, and yes, Draco is hot.

You should also know that he's not a Death Eater. I mean, his name wasn't with the rest of sixth years who took the mark, and he has a Half-Blood niece that he cares for, and Dumbledore did put him in the Head Boy position, which means that Dumbledore trusts him. Besides, he's actually been tolerable this year and, don't forget, he did save my life last year.

So, now that you know, do you think you could run some damage control for me once Ron sees me and Draco at the dance together? I'm not telling mother, or anyone else, but Ron will no doubt write directly to mother after the dance.

Thanks. I owe you one.

Your favorite sister,

Ginny

p.s. And don't you dare write him to tell him to behave, or to keep his hands off, or whatever it is you overprotective brother's write to dates for their younger sisters.

Bill thought for a minute how he should respond. While he needed to respond as if he didn't know Draco, and as if he was wary of the boy, he didn't want to turn Ginny off of Draco. He sighed and sipped his tea. When did his life get so complicated?

He set down the tea and started to get up for some parchment. The Floo flaring into life interrupted him and immediately he spun around, even though the Floo was warded against any people not involved in the operation.

Bill's contact, the man doing all of the spy work, stepped out. He was a young Frenchman by the name of Michael, though no surname was given. Bill even doubted that 'Michael' was Michael's real name, but he wasn't going to pry, not when he understood the need for secrecy. It was Michael's job to hang out in the pubs and unsavory gathering places, listening and asking for pertinent information. He couldn't be known by his true name.

"There was a break in," said Michael. "At the National Museum of Magic. Right now the officials are calling it a break-in by some jewel thieves, but word on the street is that it was Death Eaters."

"Death Eaters?" asked Bill. "Why would Death Eaters want to break into a museum?"

So, there's some D/G for you D/G lovers, and there will be more next chapter because that's the dance. However, after that, the D/G tones down a bit. Sorry folks, that's just the way it goes. Please leave a review on your way out.





12. An Unexpectedly Enjoyable Night

Draco leaned against the wall in the Great Hall watching Ginny Weasley dance with a group of her friends. More than a few boys were looking her way, but she seemed oblivious to the attention. She was too caught up in jumping up and down to the heavy beat of the newest hit by Merlin's Stone that was blasting out of synchronized crystal balls, the wizard equivalent of the best Muggle sound system there was. She was also yelling the lyrics out with the rest of the students, well, he was pretty sure she was yelling the lyrics out because her mouth was moving along to all the words, but there were so many people singing along, it was hard to tell.

The Halloween Dance seemed to be a hit so far, something he knew that as Head Boy he should be proud of, but he didn't really care. After all, he had only gone because he had to, and he had only gone with Ginny because she wouldn't let him say no.

He admitted that she hadn't been a trying date at all, which he was thankful for. He had picked her up at the Gryffindor Common Room when most of the other students had already gone down. It was partly so that their arrival together was a surprise, and partly because she still hadn't told Ron.

Laney had seen them both off, as only fourth years and up could attend the dances, and she had giggled at Draco's hair before giving him a kiss goodnight. She had wanted to stay up until they came back, but Draco wasn't going to allow it. The dances tended to run late.

Ginny was wearing a dress more suited to a night at the opera, not a Halloween dance. The dress was a black halter-top, with gold lining forming the straps and then following the modest neckline where it crossed and then continued to the back, where the dress turned daring. There was no back to the dress, the gold lining following the dress to the base of Ginny's spine, revealing ivory skin with a scattering of freckles. The dress itself hugged Ginny's form, accentuating her slight curves to their best advantage, and a slit in the front showed off glimpses of her right leg.

He was wearing a pair of faded black trousers, and a school-issued white oxford with the sleeves rolled up, but not so much that his lack of the Dark Mark showed. He wanted to keep his allegiance his own business for as long as possible. The shirt was also unbuttoned at the collar, and his Slytherin school tie was loosened and badly knotted. He wore ordinary black trainers on his feet, and his hair was completely mussed and looking very much as if he had just gotten out of bed.

Together, and dressed as they were, they had completely embodied the opposite theme, and the shock of their appearance together had created quite a stir, especially as they had made their entrance fashionably late. Ginny had been quick to reassure her friends that she and Draco were not dating, although Ron had been beside himself. It took Harry, Hermione, and Lavender Brown to get him to walk away without launching himself at Draco, and that was only because Ginny threatened to tell their mother about a certain 'pool' incident. Draco didn't want to know.

Once they had made a circle around the room, Ginny had gone off to dance with her friends, and Draco was quite relieved not to be pulled in. He knew that if she had asked him to dance, he would have said yes. Bill had written him and told him to make sure that Ginny had the best night of her life. He had told Draco that Ginny had written him as well, and that she was also writing him later that night to tell him how her night had gone, so he had better behave. That was only part of the reason Draco was keeping an eye on her. The other was that Draco was honestly intrigued by her, and she did look quite pretty.

"Draco," greeted Blaise, coming to stand by him.

Draco nodded to the other boy, his eyes still on Ginny's group, making sure that the girl was still having fun.

"You're looking very un-Malfoyish," said Blaise. "I particularly like the hair."

Draco cast an eye over Blaise. "A dog?" he asked.

"Sarah's a cat," said Blaise, gesturing to a girl with cat ears talking to a group of friends by the punch table.

"Ravenclaw, right?" asked Draco.

"When are you ever wrong?"

"Almost never."

The two seventh years were silent, surveying the crowd which had gone from a rock-and-roll frenzy to a hip-swaying, arm-waving, and occasionally grinding mass as the song switched over.

"So, Ginny Weasley?" asked Blaise.

"We're not dating."

"I should say not. You'd bore the girl to death."

Draco shot Blaise a look. He shrugged.

"I mean, Drake, you are just standing here. Shouldn't you be dancing with her?"

"We're not involved. She needed an escort because her boyfriend cheated on her, and I was going anyway."

"So, not involved."

"Isn't that what I just said?"

Blaise shrugged again. "She's hot."

Draco shot him another look, this one somewhat threatening.

"Hey," said Blaise, raising his hands. "I'm just saying. And she's a fun girl, good grades, plays Quidditch. What more could you ask for?"

"If you're so enamored, why don't you ask her out yourself?"

"Nah. She's a bit too much for me, too fiery."

"And I'm a good match for fiery now, am I?"

"Opposites do attract," said Blaise.

"True with magnets, not people."

"I forgot I'm talking with a cynic."

Draco didn't respond. What was the point? He knew that his realistic view on love was seen as cynical to those who wanted to believe in the 'perfect match' and all that other fantastical notions on relationships. He had yet to see an instance when such romantic idealisms proved true. Well, besides Bill and Fleur.

Sarah waved Blaise over, and Draco was once again left to watch the crowd, or rather, the red-headed girl in the crowd. He didn't mind the self-imposed solitude.

Ginny made her way off of the dance floor a few minutes later, fanning herself from the heat of the tightly-packed bodies. He let her get her own cup of punch and come up to him. He was making sure she had a good time, not doting on her.

"I hate this song," she said, making a face at the music. She jerked her head towards a group of chairs. "Come sit with me for a little bit."

He watched her turn and then mentally shrugged, following Ginny and sitting in a chair across from her. A few strands of hair had worked themselves loose from her sleek French twist, and they formed tight curls that framed her face. She batted them away and tried tucking them behind her ears, but they weren't quite long enough.

"Your ex has his eye on you," said Draco, just to let her know.

She groaned. "I told him we were split up a week ago. What doesn't he understand about we're not together anymore?"

"So you did tell him before today," said Draco. He had wondered why the boy hadn't made a scene when they had entered together, and he had figured that she had already told him, but still, he was surprised she hadn't gone for the big scene. While he personally did not like to display his private affairs in public, he did not think that public demonstrations in such cases as cheating were unmerited. He was curious to the reason why Ginny had not created such a scene with her ex, but wasn't going to inquire to her reasoning. A question might appear as if he was interested, so he contented himself with just the statement.

She shrugged. His eyes were drawn to her bare shoulders and he quickly averted his gaze.

"I was going to," she said, "but I couldn't help think that I would be sinking to his level by doing that, you know? And in this whole, messed-up, complete failure of a relationship, I want to know that I was the one who behaved in a mature, rational manner."

Draco raised an eyebrow, impressed at the reasoning, but not going to say so.

"What does that look mean?" she asked.

"Pardon?"

"The raised eye-brow. You must be thinking something, so what is it?"

"I didn't know that you were interested in what I thought."

"I am when it applies to myself."

"And you believe that I was thinking about you."

"I made a comment, you raised an eyebrow. I think it is safe to say that you were thinking about my remark, and I wish to know what you thought."

"You don't appear to care what others think about you. Why are you so curious now?"

"I actually do care what people think, just not about the trivial things. I care if people think I am being mean, or unsociable, but I don't allow their thoughts of what I wear or what I look like to dictate my actions. I only allow a select few people to comment and affect my wardrobe and what not."

"And you would change if they didn't like what you are wearing?"

"Only occasionally, if they have a real concern, but I never let people get away with changing the subject."

Draco figured he shouldn't really be surprised that she had picked it up so quickly. Bill had also been extremely perceptive to his ruses.

"So," said Ginny, tilting her head to the side, one curl falling over her cheek. Draco resisted the urge to brush it back. "What were you thinking?"

"You honestly care?" Draco asked, redirecting the conversation yet again. She seemed to fall into it.

"Normally, not so much, but I think I'd make an exception for you. Other people don't seem to faze you at all, and I find that interesting. It would be intriguing to hear what you think because your thoughts are completely your own."

"Not entirely. Everyone is affected by other people, so the fact that I'm not influenced by others can just be that I have been so affected by an outside source that my thought patterns have solidified."

"I don't think so," said Ginny. "You don't seem to be the type that would take on any ideas or belief systems that you didn't at first check over very thoroughly before accepting them as your own."

"And you have a basis for this?"

"Naturally."

Draco waited, but she said nothing, merely giving him a small smile and taking a sip of her punch.

"And you don't feel like explaining the basis of your assumptions?" asked Draco.

"Oh, I feel like explaining, but not until you tell me what you were thinking just then. I told you I didn't let people get away with changing the subject, so now there is an incentive behind it. You spill, and I tell you how I know what sort of person you are."

"You are assuming that I care."

"Of course you care. You're a very private person and so any leak in your cool façade must be investigated in case you let more slip than you were aware of. So what were you thinking when I told you that I broke up with Tim?"

Draco was impressed, yet again. He wondered where Ginny had learned to manipulate a conversation, and from whom. While Bill was able to trick him into speaking his mind now and again, he had never done it quite as skillfully as Ginny had just done.

"Very well," he said. "I was thinking that your actions and your reasoning appeared much more advanced than any other scorned sixteen year old girl. I decided that the mature thought processes probably come with the influence of having siblings who are much older than yourself."

She raised her eyebrows at that, and he wondered if he had said something wrong because the darkness that always seemed to linger in the back of her eyes was brought forth, as if she was dwelling on it.

"So you didn't take into account life experiences," she asked, her tone some what softer, as if she was lost in thought.

"Most sixteen year old girls don't act in such a practical way, so the conclusion that the average life experiences of teenagers as affecting the thought processes to such an extent that a self-actualized logic is applied in moments of emotional turmoil cannot be considered. Hence, for an event to have such a profound difference, it would have been significantly dramatic, such as an accident or a death in the family. Such an event has an eighty-nine point four percent chance of making it into the Daily Prophet and other news sources. While I do not make it a habit of following news stories concerning the Weasley family, I am reasonably certain that I would have heard of such an event. It is therefore plausible that such an incident did not occur and rational to attribute your logic to your older siblings."

She smiled again at that, but it didn't reach her eyes. In fact, the darkness in her eyes was even more pronounced.

Draco sat back, taking in her reaction. "Your body language suggests that my theory is flawed."

"A little off the mark," she agreed, and then, "Eighty-nine point four?" Her smile reached her eyes now, the darkness once again pushed back. "Is that a fact?"

He shrugged. "I've read some studies." He wondered why he had let his genius show like that. "You have something to tell me now," he said, directing the subject to a safer area.

"Ah, yes," said Ginny. "How I know you're the type who isn't easily swayed by opinions. I suppose it's for a couple of reasons, but mainly your allegiance, or lack of one. You honestly can't get more opinions pushed on you about Muggle-born and Purebloods, and I think that you are especially in the thick of it with your family and all, yet you still remain, as far as I can tell, on your own side. My guess is you're still figuring some things out, choosing where you want to put your allegiance, and what faction is closest to what you believe is right."

It was frightening how accurate she was, so he snorted.

"You have no idea about me, do you?" he asked.

"I know that last year you started thinking for yourself, and that was when you turned down a Death Eater position."

He leaned forward, his eyes icy and hard. "How the hell do you know that?" he demanded, but softly, not wanting to attract any unwelcome attention.

She leaned forward as well, eyes somewhat amused.

"Last year you saved Harry's life on the Quidditch field. I saw the entire thing, because I was in the air too. He didn't fall into you; you caught him. Last year you trained Buckbeak, the animal that you almost had executed in third year, and you were actually on speaking terms with Hagrid. Last year you saved my life from a ghoul, set free by Death Eaters. Last year several students from Hogwarts took the Dark Mark. I know because I make it a point to listen in on rumors going on in the school. I know that you don't have one. Now, why would the only son of Lucius Malfoy not have the Mark?"

She leaned in a bit closer, and he could feel faint traces of her breath on his lips.

"Of course Voldemort would offer it to you. If he hadn't, he would have slighted a faithful and powerful follower. The only conclusion is that you denied it. That would explain why a certain niece is in your charge. The facts add up; I just happen to be one of the few who are open-minded enough to realize the truth."

She stared into his eyes, daring him to contradict her. He stared back, trying to figure her out, trying to read what it was about her that was so intriguing. She was an enigma, sparkling, radiant on the outside, but she had hidden away the darker aspects about her, the part of her that had given her such startling insight and clarity and power of manipulation. He tried to see into that darkness, but once he brushed at it, she pulled away with a smile.

"Want to dance?" she asked.

She already knew his answer; she was changing the subject. He let her, but only because he was too close to her to think objectively about her.

"No," he said simply.

She laughed. "You're not enjoying this very much, are you?"

And then she was back on the dance floor, finding her friends and twirling into step with them. Draco watched her, trying to puzzle her out, and only succeeded in confusing himself further. That also meant he was that much more curious, which meant that he was enjoying this evening more than he had expected.

His musings were cut short because Timmy Redding was making his way over to Ginny, and Draco was immediately on the alert. Any sign from Ginny that the boy was bothering her, and he was going to step in.

The music had slowed, and it became apparent that Redding wanted the dance. Draco watched Ginny shake her head, and move away. Redding followed and Draco got up, making his way to the couple.

Ginny shook her head again, obviously telling him off, and then Redding grabbed her wrist. The boy was on the floor holding his nose in an instant; the crowd around Ginny cheered as she shook out her hand.

Ginny left the dance floor, heading the opposite direction of Draco. He hesitated, wondering if he should follow, but he could tell by the set of her shoulders that she was tensed and upset, and he was here to keep an eye on her, so he followed her.

She left by the side door, into the deserted, darkened hall. He watched her cross to the window and stare out it, pausing in the doorway, before joining her, closing the door enough so that only a faint sliver of light and music spilled out of it. He had helped plan the songs, and so he knew by the slow waltz that it was the last song of the evening.

"You alright?" he asked.

She jumped, whirling around with a hand over her heart.

"Sorry," he said, the apology slipping out automatically, which was a surprise to him.

"Didn't hear you," she said obviously, trying to calm herself.

"Didn't mean to startle you," he said. "Just wanted to make sure you were alright."

She gave him an assessing look. "You're not usually this polite."

"I was raised with manners; I was just told they were optional."

She laughed. "Especially with Weasley's, right?"

Draco shrugged slightly. "You don't look much like a Weasley tonight."

This time she raised an eyebrow. "You're quite the charmer tonight, aren't you?"

"Or I could just be disguising my insults."

"True, but that means you'll have to tell me, which was it?"

"Well, your oldest brother did write me."

She groaned. "He didn't."

"He did. Said something about making sure you had a good night or he'd take back the E he gave me last year and ruin my average."

She looked extremely embarrassed and he smirked.

"He's really over protective," she said.

"So I gathered."

She flushed again, but looked him in the eye. "Does giving me a good night include a dance?"

"Do you really want to?"

"It could be memorable."

He smirked, but softer this time and held out his hands. She came over and grasped one, resting the other on his shoulder. He let his left hand fall to her waist and then guided her into a slow waltz.

He could tell, from the first few steps, that she was a dancer, and that someone had taught her very well. While he couldn't see her with a professional dance instructor, which was how he had learned, he could imagine a little red-headed girl in pig-tails stepping on her father's shoes as an old radio pumped forth the strains of a minuet. Draco wasn't one to be overly-sentimental, but the thought made his lips twitch, and for the first, he thought that being a Weasley didn't sound that bad.

He spun her out and around and she followed fluidly, never losing a beat or faltering a step, and when he brought her back in, her hand rested on his neck, and his arm was wrapped around her back.

He slowed their steps as the music gradually drew to a finish and they were left standing, her face glowing in the moonlight from the window.

The door burst open, and the torches immediately spluttered to life, lighting the hall like it was day. Laughing couples and still singing groups poured from the door, on their way up to bed.

Draco looked over at Ginny, both of them had immediately stepped back when the door opened, and the hordes passed them, leaving only a few tired stragglers.

"I'll walk you back to your room," he said, and Ginny nodded.

The walk back up was made in silence, but it wasn't uncomfortable.

"Thank you," said Ginny, once they paused in front of the portrait. "I had a good night."

He nodded, and she seemed to hesitate before sticking out her hand. "Good night," she said.

He took her hand and kissed the back of it, telling himself it was only because she was Bill's little sister.

"Good night," he said.

She flushed ever-so-slightly, and then stepped through the portrait hole.

Draco watched her leave and then swore at himself. He strode back to the Common Room, his face twisted into a cold mask as the self-incriminations flowed.

Hermione looked up when he entered.

"Did you have a good-," she started, but he was already storming up the stairs. He shut his room door with more force than was necessary, restraining himself from slamming it because Malfoy's simply didn't slam doors.

He threw himself onto his bed, running his hands through his hair and trying to calm his breathing.

He found Ginny Weasley intriguing, no, more than that. He couldn't figure her out. She toyed with his mind, acting in ways that he didn't understand, in ways that he wanted to understand, and yet, at the same time, he wanted to be confused.

He swore again and tried to shut her out, but his mind wouldn't let the image of her rest, and his thoughts kept straying to the red-headed girl. Even the analytical side of his brain, the sharp intellect that had cracked the Persian Runes, was focused on the youngest Weasley, contrasting her every move with other sixteen year old girls, forming hypotheses and breaking theories at the rate of one every three seconds.

"Stop it," he muttered, fingers digging into his temples. "Just stop it."

How many times had he told himself, he didn't get involved with that type of girl? They were off-limits. He was off-limits. It was the only way to be sure that he didn't end up like his father. He had such difficulty trusting people, that sort of betrayal would completely shatter him.

He rolled over onto his stomach, ignoring the nagging thought that Ginny Weasley wasn't that type of girl, and pulled his pillow over his head. He would stop thinking about her; he would.

Bill Weasley sighed and rubbed his temples. It was late, and he was exhausted, but it appeared that Death Eaters didn't sleep, so he wasn't getting any either. He picked up the Auror report one more time.

On October the twenty-first there was a break in at the French National Museum of Magic.

Aurors had arrived on scene to find the jewel display from the African Ministry smashed and almost five hundred thousand galleons of precious stones and jewelry missing. The only clue to go on was a small piece of parchment dropped at the scene displaying a black cat, the signature of the group of jewel thieves.

A further investigation completed by the next day showed that the jewel display was not the only display ransacked. The Literature and Myths of the Early Magical World was also broken into, three books missing. Well, they were, for all intents and purposes, only one book, The Averne, owned by the Syrian king in the early centuries, but when the Syrians were under attack, the book had been ripped into three for easier transport when the castle was over run. They were priceless, in that they could never be replaced, although the content had survived in form of copies taken from their pages. Still, it was an odd grab because not many people were interested in the early myths. Why would the Black Cats be interested in old legends?

There was another inconsistency as well. The Black Cats usually targeted jewel stores or museum exhibits that just displayed the precious stones themselves. The rocks could then be cut down, but jewelry, especially such old pieces, were difficult to dismantle and easily recognized. It was a risk that the Black Cats didn't take.

Michael, Bill's contact, had confirmed that all the talk in the less-than-reputable places was that the break-in was thought to be Death Eater caused, and only set up to look like the Black Cats, but besides that, no one was saying anything else.

Bill rubbed his eyes and took a sip of his tea. He then checked the clock. It was late Halloween, and the school dance would be over by now. He wanted to know how it went and kept looking out the window for an owl. He wasn't particularly worried that Draco had misbehaved himself, or that Ginny had badgered him constantly, but Ginny was his little sister, and Draco was a close friend. He wanted to at least know that they survived the night.

He turned his attention back to the papers on the table, but he had been looking over the Aurors reports and had even looked over the crime scene himself, and there was nothing to prove that the Death Eaters were involved. There was nothing to prove otherwise as well.

The Floo burst into life and Michael stepped through. Bill immediately knew that something had happened.

"The Curator at the museum is missing."

"What?" asked Bill.

"He didn't show up to work yesterday, which no one thought was surprising because his health has been on the decline, but this morning his secretary finally called the Aurors because he hadn't been answering his phone. She was afraid he had become injured, or had a stroke or something. When the Aurors went to investigate, they found his house completely empty and signs of a struggle."

"Death Eaters?" asked Bill.

"There's no way to know," said Michael. "There's been no ransom demanded, no one taking responsibility. I'm heading over there tomorrow, to get pictures for you and the Auror report."

"Actually, I thought I might head over there myself and look around. I'm not an Auror, but maybe I could find something."

Michael shook his head. "I've got orders to keep you as hidden as possible now. Dumbledore says that recent information has been showing that You-Know-Who's been interested in a few ancient artifacts, but for right now, they don't know what he's planning, or even what artifacts he's interested in. He believes that this is indeed the work of Death Eaters, and if you're seen, well, you are on the wanted list."

Bill sighed. "I'm not doing a lot just sitting here."

"You're in charge of encrypting the information. You're doing enough; you've done enough. If I had a wife, there's no way I would be doing what you are. I'd be heading over to the States right now."

"I had a friend stay over there for a bit," said Bill. "But Fleur wouldn't let me take her away."

"She sounds like a wonderful woman."

"She is," said Bill, looking down at his wedding ring. He hadn't seen her in weeks, but he wouldn't visit her, or let her visit, until he was done. It was simply too dangerous.

"I must head back to the pubs," said Michael. "It's late enough so that the real dodgy characters will be out."

"Be careful," said Bill.

"Always."

And then Michael left, leaving Bill with a table full of papers and absolutely no useful information.

The letter from Ginny came then, a welcome distraction. He eagerly tore open the seal and scanned the contents, looking for any words of trouble, but she seemed fine. He went back and read it more slowly.

Hey,

It's me, writing like a promised to let you know that I'm fine. Well, I did punch Timmy, but it was deserved. And did you have to write to Draco? I thought I told you not to. It's just a little embarrassing having your older brother write your date to 'make sure I had a good night'.

Well, I did have a good night, and Draco was a perfect gentleman, so don't go demanding to know exactly what he did and said. He made absolutely no moves what so ever, which actually, now that I think about it, might be a bad thing. Is he really that unattracted to me? Not that I want him to be attracted to me, but still, I would have appreciated something a little more than one dance and a kiss on the hand good night.

And yes, it was on the hand. So don't get alarmed or anything.

Anyway, I'm going to bed now.

Night,

Ginny

Bill raised his eyebrows at the last few sentences, not exactly knowing what to think. He knew, of course, that Draco had been raised by Pureblood parents, and with a classical upbringing, and so the kiss on the hand was no more than a farewell, and Draco obviously knew that women liked such farewells, but still. Ginny was his little sister; he didn't want anyone kissing her, on the hand or otherwise.

He debated writing Draco and giving him a hard time about the kiss, but by the time the letter would reach England, it would be late, and Draco got little enough sleep as it was.

And speaking of sleep, Bill gave the papers one last look and then retired to bed himself. There would be much more to do in the morning.

He was right.

Michael returned when Bill was eating breakfast with the Auror's report, pictures taken of the curator's house, and boxes containing the contents of his desk and shelves.

Bill immediately shoved his breakfast aside and starting paging through the report, but again, like the museum, there was little to go on. He frowned, feeling a headache start to creep into his temples.

"Why would they need the Curator, if they even are Death Eaters?" he asked Michael, who was looking as frustrated as he felt.

"Who knows," said Michael. "Maybe they couldn't find what they were looking for."

"They took that one book from the Museum, right? Or the three?"

"Yes."

"Where are the copies? Maybe we can find out what they were looking for."

Michael reached under the table and pulled out three boxes filled with loose pages.

"They aren't in order," he said. "And they aren't numbered, either. They were in the storage for quite awhile."

Bill groaned, but started clearing the table. Michael opened one box and began laying the papers out.

"We'll organize them by subject first, and then see if we can't put them into chapters," said Bill.

"How long do you think this is going to take?" asked Michael.

"Longer than I would like," said Bill.

It even took longer than he thought it would because half way through, they discovered large sections written, not in the usual Latin, but in Ancient Runes. While Bill recognized most of them, he was not proficient in all of the dialects. He was mentally groaning at the amount of work when he remembered Draco.

"Alright, let's just pull out all of the bits with the runes and put them in a separate pile. I'm going to send them to a friend to sort; he knows all of these. I just hope he has time to look at them."

"Is he very busy, your friend?"

"I would imagine so. He has papers and what not to do."

"Oh, is he a professor?"

Bill looked up and laughed. "No. He's still in school."

Woot! I just made the deadline for posting this on a Monday...cheating, I know.

Please leave a reveiw!





13. Kidnappings and unLove Affairs

Disclaimer: I own nothing, except a brown sugar cinnamon poptart that I am eating because our college has closed down for the day. (Woot!)

A/N: Monday updates (laughs nervously), yeah, about those. Well, I'm actually going to change them to Tuesday updates. Why? Because I have on class on Tuesday as opposed to the four on Monday, and also Jack Bauer is on television Mondays and I am a firm believer.

I would also like to apologize for the incredibly long wait. Because I am sorry, I will update again, TOMORROW! So, hopefully you will find it in your hearts to forgive me.

Tdei: Yeah, I have a few other slash fans who read this fic, but I just don't do slash (sry), but I'm glad you like it and thanks for reviewing anyways!

Freyalyn: It is fun to mess with his head, thanks for the review!

Bena24: So, there is actually a D/G conversation in this chapter, just because it fit so well, so I hope you like it!

Spyrit: Hmm, has my muse been talking with you? Because you are spot on with the Persian Runes, congrats! As for Draco and his hair (sigh), I love white-blonds, and the fact that I can make his hair look anyway I want it ;-)

Drewberry: I'm glad you like Bill. I always thought he was one of the cooler characters in the books. Thanks!

Richkid.draco: Yeah, I like Draco's bed-head too, well, that is why I wrote it that way (grins). Thanks!

Sanjs: I'm sorry for making you wait, especially as you have a count down in your review, but, I am posting again tomorrow, so you will only have a day to wait. Thanks!

QuinkyDink: Ginny did seem mature in the books, part of the reason I've always liked her. Thanks for the review!

Lilith: Did you have fun in Italy? I was in Italy a few days and loved it, but I don't speak Italian, so I was confused… a lot. And I promise that by the end of this story, I will have divulged the 'Blaise with fangs', just for you!

Mask: Hey! Don't knock me singing in the mall (sticks out tongue)

It was official. Draco was not going to be on the Quidditch team this year. While he knew it was probably for the best (he was swamped as it was) he still felt a few pangs of disappointment. No, it was more than that. He kept finding his attention drifting out of his shared common room window, where the Quidditch Pitch was just visible and he could see the teams practicing. He needed to play, or even fly, or just something that would get him away from the stifling classrooms and boring homework.

He had his extra work of course; the runes and the translating and potion, but all of it took time and trial and error. There was nothing to show that he had been doing anything and the lack of results was putting a strain on him. He was restless; he needed something else to do, something with real, tangible results and for a real, important purpose.

Dumbledore brought just such a distraction with him.

Draco had been trying to concentrate on the amounts of ingredients needed for the compulsion suppression now that the Veritaserum was finished, but his eyes were locked to the window, his fingers itching to grab his broom. He was getting no where with the counter, and he knew that conceptual potions would only take him so far with the concoction. The majority of the work would be educated hypotheses with painstakingly documented trial runs. He was not looking forward to it.

The door had opened, but he hadn't paid attention because the only one who could get in without inside admittance was Hermione. He forgot that the teachers had the password as well.

He started when Dumbledore cleared his throat, and his head whipped around to spot the intruder.

"Sorry to startle you, my boy," said Dumbledore, twinkling up at him.

"Headmaster," said Draco, nodding to Dumbledore. "What brings you here?"

"Bill has sent me a request of you, but I was told not to deliver it unless you had sufficient time. William is concerned that you may be busy and he doesn't want to detract from your studies."

"I don't study," said Draco shortly. "What was the request?"

"Come with me," said Dumbledore.

Draco set down his books and parchment and followed Dumbledore out of the room. The Headmaster led him to the Room of Requirement, where there was a table set in the middle of the room, holding three boxes. Along the walls were a multitude of clips with which to hang papers. Draco raised an eyebrow and the set up.

"Bill is looking into a kidnapping," said Dumbledore.

Draco immediately knew who it must be. "The French Curator, Jean Barret, most well known for his work translating the Romany dialects and for translating the entire text of The Proeliator which was written in the Syrian Runes," said Draco. He had been following the story in the papers. "He was found missing a week after the museum robbery." He paused for a moment, realizing that if Bill was involved, so must be the Dark Lord. "I didn't realize it was Death Eater related. I assume then that you suspect the robbery was also Death Eater related?"

"We have no evidence as of yet, but Bill's contact says that the word on the street is that the Death Eaters were indeed the perpetrators."

Draco frowned. Since when was Voldemort interested in museum artifacts?

"Along with the jewelry taken, three books were taken, or rather, one. The Averne. You are familiar with it?"

"The most well-known ancient text. Originally written on scrolls during the time of the Syrian reign, but then transferred into a large tome to keep all of the information in one place under the direction of the King Avere. When the Syrian empire fell, the tome was split into three portions, one going to each of the king's mages. They were reunited in 1347, and were moved around in various displays until coming to a permanent home in the French National Museum of Magic in 1885.

"While most chapters were written in Latin, a good amount are written in different Ancient Runes, which makes it the book containing the largest number of different languages, ranging from Turkish to African runes. While it is the most famous ancient text, the chapters mainly refer to mythological beings and items, so it has been counted as merely a work of fiction and folklore."

"You are well informed."

"I saw the book on display when I was younger and was intrigued."

"Ah, yes," said Dumbledore. "I often forget that you were raised in France. You converse quite fluidly in English."

Draco inclined his head in acceptance of the compliment, even though the transition had not been difficult. Trying, perhaps, and most aggravating when Lucius insisted that he lose all traces of his accent, but not difficult, not for him.

"The theft of the book was not reported in the news," he said.

"No. It was not. The French Ministry had no desire to start speculations on the robbery, especially not when the rumors of Death Eaters are already circulating."

Draco frowned slightly, already knowing that he would have to procure a copy of the Auror's report for his own investigation. He didn't trust any judgment but his own.

"And Bill requires my help in translating the copies?" Draco asked. "I should think the museum would have such translations in storage."

"The copies themselves were destroyed a few decades back in a fire. Because there was no real scholarly interest in the book, because it is regarded as a work of fiction, the museum did not hire linguists to make new translations. Instead, they merely used spells to copy the pages and put them in boxes. Unfortunately for us, the pages are scrambled. Bill wishes to know if you have the time to organize them."

Draco raised an eyebrow. "You believe that the Dark Lord is interested in one of the artifacts mentioned in the book?"

"We believe that he may have found something of interest, yes."

"Even though most objects in the book are thought to be fictional?"

"There has been a reawakening of interest in mythological items ever since the discovery of Merlin's staff not twenty ago. It seems these objects might not be as illusory as was once thought. Even Horcruxes are generally thought to be mystical objects and not fact."

"If the passage needed by Voldemort was one written in Ancient Runes, then the kidnapping of the Curator is understandable, especially if the chapter was written in the Syrian or Romany dialects. Those are the two languages the Curator specialized in and they are two of the rarer runes."

"That is what we suspected."

"I take it then you would like a translation of the chapters as well as reorganizing them?"

"If you have the time."

"I do."

"I thank you for your help."

Draco nodded, already moving over to the first box. He only vaguely registered when the Headmaster left the room. Being able to translate, and hence, read the full and true account of The Averne was an incredible opportunity and he pulled the first pages out almost reverently. He wondered if he could get Bill to send him copies of the chapters written only in Latin. He would like to read those as well.

He worked straight until dinner, falling into a system. He first sorted the pages due to their runes, and then, once he had the chapters separated, clipped the pages onto the walls. He then stepped back, picking a page out at random and figuring out which page followed, and which preceded it. He moved the clips about until he had the papers lined up in the right order, and then set about translating them, using a dictaquill that the room provided to write as he read out loud, translating in his head.

He worked until dinnertime, finishing two chapters and starting on the third. Normally he would have worked through dinner, but he had made it a habit of attending to make sure that Laney was well. He found her chattering happily away with a few friends, and so he allowed himself to leave early.

He managed to complete three more chapters before bedtime, and it was only when he had read over the first page of the fourth Greek dialect without making any sense of it, that he grudgingly put the papers away for the night.

Draco managed to work on the translations for a few more hours before dinner the next day, but then after eating, he had to meet with Snape in the potions room for more work on the counter to the Veritaserum.

Snape started the conversation with, "I trust you are not busy next week?"

"I have spare time," Draco allowed.

"Lupin will need his Wolfsbane next week. Miss Granger has been making it up until now but she professed a concern for her studies."

Draco nodded. "I will be able to make the potion."

"Good. Now then, how much of the blood root did you believe we will need?"

By the end of the session, they had roughly sketched the first five ingredients to be added to the counter, through much debate and theorizing. They raised their voices a few times and had never really agreed on the sixth. Both were convinced the other was wrong and were taking the week to research.

It took two days work on the translations before Draco came across something interesting. The chapter was found in the second book, written in the Syrian dialect. It detailed a cloak that was supposedly worn by Merlin, allowing him to get into any fortress or castle, regardless of the wards. The cloak was supposedly made out of a combination of thestral and faerie hair, which sounded plausible to Draco. If this cloak actually worked, then Voldemort would have no problem getting into Hogwarts.

The kidnapping made perfect sense. The Death Eaters could have heard of the cloak and stolen the books in an attempt to learn where the cloak was located. However, they couldn't have known that the chapter they needed was in the Syrian dialect. The Syrian runes are the most complex in the known Ancient Runes and the translators of the language are few and far between. The Death Eaters must have kidnapped the Curator in order for him to translate the known about a certain artifact described in the book, but the Syrian dialect was the most difficult to translate. The Death Eaters had been unable to read the description, so they had taken the Curator.

He gathered up the pages, planning on taking them straight to Dumbledore. After all, Nott had told him that the Dark Lord planned on visiting Hogwarts personally, and with this cloak, he could get in. The cloak was in Merlin's grave, or rather, the wizard's empty grave as the body of Merlin was never located.

If the Curator was stalling for time, in hopes of a rescue, then perhaps the cloak would not have been taken yet. Dumbledore could alert the guards that stood round the tomb, and perhaps even set up an ambush.

That all depended on the Curator though, and Draco didn't know many people who would dare to cross Voldemort in that way. The Dark Lord had a way of being very persuasive, and Draco didn't see an old man being willing to withstand a good bout of the Cruciatus just to stall for time.

Still, there was a chance, and so Draco found himself traveling up the staircase to Dumbledore's office with an extra copy of the translation he had made.

"Come in!" called Dumbledore, from behind the closed door before Draco had a chance to knock and he grimaced, hating the way the Headmaster always seemed to know whenever anyone arrived with no alarm system in sight. He pushed open the door to see Dumbledore sitting at his desk covered in papers and folders.

"Ah, Draco," said the Headmaster, twinkling up at him despite the overwhelming amount of work on his desk. "I doubt even a genius of your caliber has finished all of the chapters yet, so that must mean you have discovered a chapter of interest, yes?"

"You are correct," said Draco, relieved that Dumbledore was getting to the point and not engaging in frivolities or offering him a lemon drop.

"Well, then," said Dumbledore, pushing the clutter on his desk to the side. "Do tell what you have found." In clearing a space on his desk, he uncovered his jar full of lemon drops and he held up the candy. "Lemon drop?" he asked.

Draco resisted the urge to groan, and instead placed the chapter detailing the cloak in front of the Headmaster. He took a seat in one of the chintz armchairs.

"That is a chapter in the second book. I found that it references a cloak worn by Merlin that would allow him to enter any fort, regardless of what wards were placed on the structure. The cloak is located in Merlin's grave."

"And you came to the conclusion that this is what Voldemort is looking for?"

"It is the only object detailed that has a plausible history, and the chapter was written in the Syrian dialect."

"The Curator was known for his work in that field."

"It is one of the factors which lead me to believe that this is the object of interest."

"It is indeed of interest," said Dumbledore. "There have been no reports of any attempted entry at Merlin's tomb, but I shall alert them to the possibility. Is there anything else that has caught your eye?"

"I still have a few chapters to go," said Draco. "May I ask what you intend to do with the information on the cloak?"

"You feel as if more should be done than warning the guards?"

"The Dark Lord can be quite determined. I have heard that he wished to visit Hogwarts personally."

"Indeed?" asked Dumbledore.

"I am sure that you have heard the same," said Draco.

"I have, but I do have sources. I wasn't aware you had such."

"I have heard from a student with a less-than reputable association."

"Ah," said Dumbledore. "And what more do you believe is necessary?"

"An evacuation plan to begin with, one that is not simply escaping through the Floo because that can be easily disconnected."

"We have several hundred students at Hogwarts."

"Then it must be a simple plan as well," said Draco.

"And you have such a plan?"

"Not in its entirety, no. But I do have a suggestion, if you aren't opposed?"

"Of course not."

Draco nodded. "The Gryffindor and Ravenclaw dorms are located closest to the lake. Should Voldemort attack during night or evening, which is most probably, those students would have the best chance of getting away safely by the boats the first years take on their first visit."

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "That would be most efficient," he said.

"Of course wards would have to be placed on the boats to shield off any wayward spells, and also a few spells to keep the students inside, but it is the quickest way out."

"And of the Slytherin and Hufflepuff students?"

"There is a concealed exit that I am sure you are aware of in the dungeons. Several Portkeys could be placed just in the Forbidden Forest that the students could reach. Of course, you would have to look into setting those up, and setting up a charm to call the boats to the dock in an emergency. The teachers and prefects would also have to be informed, but it is a feasible evacuation."

"It is indeed," said Dumbledore. "I will be sure to look into it. Thank you."

Draco nodded and then stood. "There are still a few more chapters left to translate. I will let you know if I find anything else of interest."

"Again, thank you," said Dumbledore.

Draco left, walking back down to the Room of Requirement and starting the next chapter of the translations. It took him another day and a half to discern that there was nothing else of interest to Voldemort in The Averne. The other chapters detailed accounts of a war, and the very last was written in the second version of the Persian Runes, which no one else had translated.

Draco had been pleased to find the Persian Runes in the book, knowing that only he could decipher them, which meant he was, or would be, reading what no one had been able to read in centuries. The prospect was exciting, even if he would have to translate the fourth and third versions of the dialect before getting to the second.

Draco packed up the translations of the chapters and then had it shipped by Floo post to Bill. The owls simply wouldn't be able to hold the load.

For a day after he finished the translations on The Averne, he felt settled, but then he passed the Slytherin Quidditch team in the hall and the restlessness came back with a vengeance. Although he had enjoyed working on the translations, he was feeling somewhat relieved that it was finished because it had taken up all of his time and his school work was beginning to suffer. Well, not suffer, but he had fallen into the habit of simply earning E's in all of his classes because he was too busy to plan out strategic scores.

He had also been unable to find the passage he had wanted to disprove Snape's worry that adding the Ashwinder tongue before essence of Murtlap would not nullify the venom of the nundu blood. He could clearly remember every word on the page that would prove him correct, for some reason he could not picture the book title. He felt as if his brain was being pulled in too many directions.

He sighed and allowed himself to flop on the couch in his common room because Hermione was not there. He vaguely wondered where she might be, before deciding that he didn't care, and then he stretched, trying to loosen the knot in his shoulders that was the result of bending over the table translating runes for the past few days.

He sat up wearily, knowing that he needed to get started on his work, but then he glanced outside and saw the Slytherin Quidditch team practicing on the pitch. He groaned as the urge to get out there and fly washed over him again and he headed for the stairs, planning on taking a hot shower in hopes to loosen his muscles and get him to relax enough so that he could concentrate on his homework. It was then that there was a knock on the door, and because he was right there, he opened it instead of merely calling to give his admission.

Pansy Parkinson stood in the doorway, her hair pinned up in curls and make-up perfectly applied. She was wearing a too-tight, too-low deep purple shirt and an incredibly short black skirt.

Draco was surprised to see her, even more surprised when she stepped in, her hands running through his hair before forcing his head down so she could touch her lips to his. More than just touch lips. Her mouth locked onto his, her tongue delving into his mouth even as she pulled her body flush with his.

Draco managed to pull his mind back together just as she was moving her hand from his hair to his belt and he stepped back, his hands on her shoulders, keeping her away from him so he could try and think.

"What the hell?" he managed.

Pansy shrugged. "The Dark Lord wants me to seduce you."

Draco blinked. "What?"

"The Dark Lord," said Pansy, very slowly, "wants me to seduce you."

"Let me rephrase," said Draco. "Why?"

Pansy shrugged. "A few reasons. Mostly, as I am going into politics, he wants to be sure that I can play the game right and sleep my way out of a problem, or use my feminine wiles to find out certain bits of information."

"And the information he wants from me?" asked Draco.

"The usual. What are your weakness, what can he do to make you miserable, you know. He still rather angry about the stunt you pulled over last summer."

"And why are you telling me this?"

Pansy laughed. "Because there is no way I could put this past you. You're smarter than you let on, and you always seem to tell when someone lying to you. Besides, there is your general distrust of women to consider as well."

Draco though about denying that last statement, but Pansy knew him too well so he ignored it. "So you decided to tell me the truth?"

"Aren't you glad for the warning?"

"You're playing both sides," Draco realized.

"I'm trying to get through this war alive and with enough money to live comfortably. I think you're smart enough to make it through relatively unscathed, and if being honest with you endears me to you, so much the better."

"No doubt you'll want some information to give to the Dark Lord."

"Some little tidbits would be nice. They don't have to be true, just believable."

"If I am going to be looking out for you, I'm going to need to know where and when the Dark Lord's planning to attack."

"I can do that."

"Then we have an agreement."

Pansy smiled. "I love it when we're on the same side," she said, stepping closer, her intentions clear in her eyes. She snaked an arm around his neck and kissed the side of his jaw, working her way down his neck.

Draco bit back a moan. "I assume this is just merely for show?"

"No one's watching," she whispered, and then she pulled back. "Alright, so it's partly for show. Certain Slytherins have to believe that I really am seducing you. The other part is just because I've missed us together. Haven't you?"

He didn't answer; he just pulled her closer and captured her lips in a searing kiss, feeling her respond eagerly. He didn't pull back until he needed air.

"I'll take that as a 'yes'," Pansy gasped, forcing him back to the wall. He turned at the last minute so that he pinned her there, and then he began pulling out her hair clips so that her hair tumbled down over her shoulders.

She was fumbling with his clothes, unknotting his tie and letting it fall on the floor before turning to the buttons and Draco was trying to find the fastening to her shirt. They were both distracted by their mouths, hers was busy trying to latch onto his lips while he nipped at the sensitive hollow at her throat that made her gasp. They were also sidetracked with trying to press as physically close as possible to each other, legs intertwined and hips grinding together.

Pansy had just managed to get his shirt halfway off when the door swung open and Hermione stepped in, followed by Harry. They both pulled up short and Draco stepped back from Pansy, pulling his shirt back on at Hermione's horrified expression. Harry was beat red and looking the other way.

Hermione opened her mouth but then Pansy grabbed Draco's hand.

"I know a place," she said.

Draco followed her out the door, ignoring the scandalized, but concerned, expression of Hermione.

The place that Pansy had in mind was Trelawney's tower room, one of the more comfortable sites for extra curricular activities, and in getting there, Pansy managed to walk them by Theodore Nott. Granted, the walk involved frequent stops to pull the other close for another kiss, or to tease the other with roaming hands and groping, but they made it without incident and Draco looked the trapdoor with a particularly powerful spell, and then Pansy was pushing him onto on of the squishy chairs and pulling his shirt off again.

Draco made his way back to the Head's common room over an hour later. His shoes were untied and his shirt missing a few buttons, but he didn't pass anyone in the hall so he didn't bother to fix his hair that practically screamed 'I have just been shagged'.

He pushed open the door to find Harry still over with Hermione but Ginny Weasley had also joined them. She raised her eyebrows as he walked in, but he merely sank into his favorite armchair. He wasn't really in a mood to socialize with them, but he was exhausted, in a good way, and didn't feel like moving.

"So," said Ginny, looking him over and obviously feeling like teasing him. "How was your day?"

Draco remembered the first time she had asked him that and so he responded in kind.

"Passable," he said.

"Ooo, only passable?" asked Ginny wincing. "I'm sorry. Better luck next time."

Draco's lips quirked up and he had to bite back a laugh. Ginny noticed.

"Note to remember," she said. "Draco Malfoy is apparently not so much of a bastard right after he's been shagged."

"I fail to see how this will be of benefit to you."

"You never know when certain pieces of knowledge might come in handy," she said solemnly and he had to suppress another smile.

"I'm serious," she said, noticing the twitch of his lips. "I have a book full of this stuff. For example, Harry here loves to fly, but he is terrified of heights when it involves ladders."

Draco looked over to where Harry and Hermione sat together, listening into their conversation. Harry shrugged at Ginny's statement; it was obviously true.

"And Hermione is allergic to birds but sleeps with a feather pillow anyway."

"It's just more comfortable," said Hermione.

"Professor McGonagall's animagi form is a cat but she can retain her night vision for a few hours after she comes out of her form."

Draco gave the Gryffindor girl a look. "How many people do you keep tabs on?"

Ginny shrugged. "The ones I feel are important."

"I'm important now?"

"You've always been important to me."

Silence.

"Alright," said Ginny, "that came out completely wrong. Basically, I keep tabs on people who may be influential to the activities around myself. As you are in an influential position, yes, I keep tabs on you."

"So you're keeping tabs on everyone who may be key players in the war. Rather Slytherin of you."

"I got lots of experience at home. Growing up with six older brothers is not an easy thing to do."

"I'll take your word for it."

"Ah, you're trusting my word. That's rather Gryffindor of you."

Draco shrugged. "I doubt you would lie about it. You are still mostly Gryffindor so that makes you truthful."

"But what can we say is truer, the intention of honesty, mistaken, or the truth given with the intention to deceive?" Ginny quoted.

"Marlin Brimley," said Draco. "Impressive."

"I like to keep up with wizarding philosophy," Ginny shrugged. "His first book was better than his second."

"Most people say it was the other way around."

"He spent too much time on the classical questions in the second. I liked it better when he theorized about the little things, the ones that interested him. His column in the paper is the best, I think, because he doesn't spend too much time elaborating on different theories."

Draco blinked. "The paper," he said. "I'm an idiot."

Ginny raised her eyebrows. "The paper said you were an idiot, or you are an idiot because of the paper?"

Draco was already out of his seat and in front of his bookshelf by the fire, grabbing the large tome of medical journals and then walking back to his seat, already flipping through it to the eighty-second page and finding the passage he needed.

"Nundu blood," he read, "was once a treatment for the bite of the Ash snake, however, for the blood to be non-lethal, the proportion of Nundu blood had to be exactly half of the venom. Because of the volatile nature of the blood, the treatment was stopped once the antidote was developed by Wilhelm Fends."

"The paper was right," said Ginny, nodding sagely. "You are an idiot."

"This was originally published in a medical paper. I had forgotten where I read it until you mentioned Brimley's column."

"And you need to know that Nundu blood was once a treatment for the Ash snake, why?"

"Because the Ash snake is a cousin of the Ashwinder, which means adding the nundu blood before the essence of murtlap will not nullify the effects of the blood which proves Snape wrong."

Draco sat back in his chair feeling extremely satisfied with himself. The three Gryffindors looked at him a little oddly but he didn't mind.

"Note to self," said Ginny, "Draco Malfoy is apparently a lot smarter than what was originally suspected."

Draco knew he should be concerned that he had just revealed to the three that he was obviously quite intelligent, and that he was also proving Snape wrong and working with him on a project, but at the same time, he didn't think they would tell anyone else. Besides, Bill and Dumbledore and Kingsley already knew, and not through any revelations on his part. It was about time other people his age knew. It might prove to be of use further on.

Bill received the owl that Draco had found a chapter detailing Merlin's cloak from Dumbledore. A day later he received the owl saying that Aurors had been sent to the tomb of Merlin, but it was undisturbed. At least, it was undisturbed for now.

A day later and he received a package by Floo. It was from Draco and it contained the chapters that had been written in Ancient Runes perfectly in order with their accompanying translations.

Bill knew Draco would have it finished quickly, but he hadn't expected it in less than a week. It was incredible what the kid could do and Bill immediately set about reading the chapter Dumbledore had written about.

The cloak did seem intriguing, and Bill wondered why Voldemort hadn't taken it yet. He supposed that the Curator could be taking his time with the chapter, but still, Voldemort could be most persuasive, and from what he had been told about the Curator, he had been an intelligent, but soft, old man. Bill couldn't see that type of man lasting up for a week against Voldemort, and he wondered why the self-proclaimed lord hadn't gone for the cloak yet.

Of course, Voldemort could merely be biding his time, not expecting the Order and Aurors to have discovered his intentions yet. If that was the case, the Aurors under-cover at the tomb could have an opportunity to put a serious stint in Voldemort's plan.

Bill came to the last chapter, a little surprised at first to see it untranslated, but then he looked closer and realized it was the second Persian Rune dialect. He knew Draco was probably already looking into translating the chapter and no doubt the genius was thrilled to be the first one in centuries to read the chapter.

"Your friend is quite smart," said Michael, looking over the chapters as well, obviously impressed at the speed in which the translations had come.

"That he is," Bill agreed. "Dumbledore has already set up Aurors at the tomb of Merlin."

"So, we are finished with the book then?" asked Michael.

Bill looked at the boxes of pages and nodded. "Looks like it," he said.

"You should take this over to the museum then," said Michael.

"I thought I was under house arrest?"

Michael laughed. "It is for your own protection you know, but I shall let you out this once. The Curator's secretary is trying to get his house back in order, and she came across a few notebooks of runes and some loose pages. She needs someone with knowledge of Ancient Runes."

"And you volunteered me."

"Naturally," said Michael.

"It will feel good to get out of this house," admitted Bill.

"And that is why I volunteered you." Michael checked his watched and then stood. "I must be off."

"I thought you didn't frequent the pubs until later."

"I don't," said Michael. "This is…a different appointment."

Bill frowned, getting the idea that Michael wasn't exactly telling him something. After months of learning to read Draco, the rest of the world was much simpler.

"What are you doing?" he asked.

"There is a man I met, one who has information on the Curator's disappearance."

"But that's not our job anymore," said Bill. "The Auror's are taking over the investigation."

"But the Aurors cannot go where I can go," said Michael. "If I can get this man to talk, then perhaps we will know where the Curator is being held. Once we know that, we can contact the Aurors and formulate an escape plan. But only I can do this."

Michael looked sincere, but Bill was worried he had a bit of a hero-mentality. He nodded anyway.

"Alright, but with one his of a problem, you come back here, and we'll take you out. I don't want your cover to be blown."

Michael smiled. "Thank you. I promise I will not take any unnecessary risks."

"Good," said Bill, and then Michael stepped back through the Floo.

It did feel good to get out. Bill Flooed to the Museum with the boxes of chapters and also his own journals to help him translate the Curator's work. He was met by the middle-aged secretary who was sporting horn-rimmed glasses and bright red lipstick. Bill tried not the laugh at the complete cliché the woman embodied.

"Hello," she said, holding out her hand. "I'm Mildred, but you can call me Millie. Thank you so much for coming. Did you do these translations?"

"No, a friend of mine did," said Bill.

"And what is his name?" asked Millie, pulling out a notebook. "I'll be sure to have the display give his name."

"Oh," said Bill. "Actually, he would like to remain anonymous for now, is that alright?"

"Of course," said Millie. "You just let me know when he changes his mind."

"Thanks," said Bill.

"You can just leave those boxes right there," said Millie. "I've already told the display men where to put it. We'll be Flooing out to Mr. Barret's house and thank you, in advance, for coming. When he finally gets home, I want everything to be perfectly in place."

"I understand," said Bill, and then stepped into the fireplace.

The Curator's house was large, and decorated in pleasing shades of whites and pastels.

"His office is right over here," said Millie, leading him to a closed door and opening it. "I tried to straighten up the best I could, but I can't make heads or tails of his papers. All of them in runes, all of them."

The office still showed signs of a struggle. The room was bright, with a floor length window behind the desk, but a few of the bookcases were scratched, and one had a shelf missing, the tomes piled on top of each other. A table had a wooden prop in place of one of it's legs, and there was a lamp missing, only the lamp shade remaining behind.

All of the Curator's knick-knacks were set out randomly on his desk, and the chairs and table held boxes full of pages and notebooks.

"Wow," said Bill. "He was a busy guy."

"He loved his work," said Millie. "And ever since his wife died, well, he hasn't had time for anything else, not even his son."

"How old is his son now?" asked Bill.

"In his twenties, I would imagine. I've only ever seen him once. His son wanted to be an Auror, and Jean disapproved. There was quite a falling out, but I think that Jean was mostly against the idea because he didn't want to lose his son as well."

Bill gave a small smile of sympathy and walked to the boxes. He pulled out a notebook at random and flipped through it.

"I'll leave you to it then," said Millie. "I'll come back with some lunch for you in a bit."

"Thank you," said Bill, nodding to the woman.

The door was closed and then Bill set to work.

It took him a day before he found the code in the Curator's journal.

KK, so the next chapter is going up tomorrow. Excited? Curious? Mildly Intrigued? If so, leave a review. If not, do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars.





14. Blue Violet and Avada Green

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. I do own the sore bum and bruise on my hand for slipping on the ice that's covering all of PA, NY, and NE. It was really funny (the fall, not the ice).

Silvera: Glad to hear that you are liking the D/G interaction. I am planning to throw Ginny in there every so often, just to keep things going b/t her and Draco, but not in this chapter. Thanks!Spyrit: Yes, I do reveal who the Curator's son is today, and I hope you like it. Also you can mention Draco and his sex-hair all you want. Why do you think I wrote it after all? (grins!)

Conngirl87: I didn't mean to suggest that Dumbledore hadn't thought of one, just that he is interested in what Draco had thought of. As for Draco being presumptuous, yeah, he is a little bit. Thanks for reviewing!

Kasiuke: Have you gone to bed yet? I hope so, all-nighters are never fun. And I'm glad that you like my Pansy. I always thought, for her to make Slytherin, there must be something more to her. Thanks!

FaithMaguire: Aww, no school today either? I didn't get that, but probably cuz I'm just in PA and not up there with the majority of the snow. And I understood your math equation. Thanks for the review!

Astaroth: LOL, it's up, it's up!

Sanjs: I'm the best? You're my fav reviewer now, lol. As for Pansy, she'll be okay as she's not exactly one of the higher up minions. Thanks!

Freyalyn: I'm glad that you're getting into cuz that means I'm doing my job, well, not my job cuz I'm not getting paid, but you know. Thanks for the review!

"I gather you have made this before?"

Draco looked up at Professor Snape, who was watching him brew the Wolfsbane from his desk where he was grading papers.

"It was one of the potions I had to make for my certification."

He carefully added the manticore hoof to the Wolfsbane, pulling his hand back from the cauldron quickly so that he wouldn't get splashed by the boiling substance.

"You could just put the hoof on your ladle and lower it into the potion," remarked Snape drolly.

Draco shrugged. "That would take all of the excitement out of potion making."

"Potions shouldn't be exciting, which is something my third years should learn. They're boiling over their cauldrons every chance they get. Yes, it is quite exciting to have standing flames and noxious smoke."

Draco smirked and then waited for the potion to turn blue before adding a cup of water and then lessening the flame underneath the cauldron. He perched on a desk and waited for the boiling to simmer down.

"I hear a certain Slytherin has been spending time with you," said Snape. "And by 'time' I mean nights."

Draco raised an eyebrow. "Worried?"

"Not about you," said Snape dryly. Draco knew that he was partly lying.

"I know what I'm doing," he said.

"Not even geniuses are immune to matters when women are involved."

"Not every genius is me."

"I just want to make sure you know what you are doing. Attachments that seem to be nothing can quickly turn to so much more."

"It's not turning into anything more."

"Feelings may come into play," continued Snape, undaunted.

"There are no feelings."

"For now."

"There won't be any feelings." Draco's voice was sharper, frustration leaking through.

"You can't be sure-,"

"Yes, I damn well can!"

Draco's almost-shout rang through the classroom and Snape raised an eyebrow, having pushed Draco to the point where it was perfectly clear how he felt about Pansy.

"I thought so," he said. "Lucius really has had quite the influence on you."

Draco's eyes narrowed. "Don't mention him," he said icily.

"I was somewhat concerned that you were going to get in over your head and be swept away by Ms. Parkinson's feminine wiles. I see now that the only danger you are in is missing out on the female sex entirely."

"I can tell you, I'm not missing out," said Draco.

"I can assure you, you are," said Severus. "Take it from a man who has deliberately turned away love; unless the woman you are with truly and deeply cares for you, and unless you are willing to care as well, you will never understand women, and never be able to appreciate them."

"The hell brought this on?" Draco demanded. "Valentine's day is in February."

"The Headmaster is aware of your extra-curricular activities," Snape said.

"Something I didn't want to know."

"And he is concerned for your emotional well-being."

"I'm showing that I'm a healthy teenaged boy with hormones," said Draco, getting off of the table and getting ready to add the powdered wolf teeth.

"He is afraid that you will remain…," Snape trailed off, obviously searching for a word.

"Cold?" asked Draco. "Unfeeling, aloof, distant, emotionally unavailable?"

"Alone when you have no need to be," said Snape.

"And he asked you to talk to me about it?"

"Yes."

"And you couldn't come up with anything more subtle?"

"Anything short of outright saying it, and you wouldn't get the point."

"I wouldn't get the point?" asked Draco, incredulous. "I'm a genius."

"You are a genius in mathematics, and language, and every other subject taught in this school. You are not a genius when it comes to emotional matters. In fact, I could even say you are completely clueless."

"I know when someone is harboring a secret crush on another. I know when two people are seeing each other in secret. I can tell if a marriage is going to last with a ninety-two percent accuracy rate by merely dining with the couple and I'm an idiot when it comes to the subject of emotions?"

"Yes, you can tell when someone has a crush, but have you ever felt one?" Snape countered.

"I don't get 'crushes'," said Draco.

"Precisely my point."

"What? I don't behave in a childish manner concerning matters of the opposite sex and that's your whole basis for your belief that I'm lacking smarts in the emotional field?"

"Naturally," said Snape.

"That makes absolutely no sense."

"No, what makes no sense is your insistence that you are emotionally beyond capable when you haven't even held a crush on a girl."

"This is ridiculous."

"Is it?"

"By not falling into the common mistakes of harboring secret, immature likings for another person based on looks or comedic values simply means that I am an impartial observer, the only person whose opinion can be based on something other than personal experience. It actually makes for arguing that I am one of the few who are to be taken seriously when it comes to these matters because I am not basing my theories on personal experience."

Snape crossed over to the cauldron, watching as Draco added the powder because it was one of the more delicate processes of the potion. Adding too much at one time would cause the powder to clump up, which would ruin it, but at the same time, too little, and the potion would cool before all of it could be dissolved.

"Would you call that blue or purple?" he asked, nodding his head at the liquid.

" It's actually blue violet," said Draco.

"But is it blue or purple? If you had to categorize it, which would it go under?"

"Purple," said Draco.

"I think it should be blue," said Snape. "In my experience, that is more of an indigo than a purple."

"And my experience says that it should be purple. It's just a matter of opinion."

"Would you ask a blind person to be the judge of what color it should be?"

"Pardon?"

"If your theory holds true, if only you are to be trusted in the field of emotions because you have had no experience with matters of the heart, than a blind person could tell you what color this is because they've had no experience with the two colors and so they have no personal ties to either hue."

Draco frowned as he finished adding the powder and stirred three times. He brought up the flame under the cauldron.

"That analogy doesn't apply," he argued lamely, the only objection he could come up with.

"But doesn't it?" asked Snape.

"A blind person doesn't even know what color is, or that it even exists."

"And do you know what it is like to love a woman, or for a woman to love you?"

"Love doesn't exi-," Draco started, and then he stopped because he had walked right into Snape's argument. He swore and then turned and started picking up the ingredients. "What is this?" he asked as he slammed the jars back on their shelves. He turned and faced Snape. "Why, all of a sudden, is my belief on emotions such a point of interest with you all? I've been going to this school for seven years, and now you choose to look into my well-being?"

"Dumbledore is concerned," said Snape mildly.

"He just found out I'm a bloody genius, just held a real converstaion with me. He doesn't get to be concerned, and for that matter, neither do you. You can't decide to care about my well-being now that I've decided to join your side."

Snape didn't answer, not at first. He was checking the levels and color of the potion. Right now the potion was boiling away into steam, and as it did, the color changed from a blue violet to a very decided indigo. When there was a goblet-full left, he took the cauldron off the flame and then spooned the contents into a cup, steam still rising off of the potion.

He turned around and handed it to Draco.

"Lupin should be in his room still. I believe he is teaching an extra class on Boggarts for those who are having difficulties."

Draco took the goblet and headed for the door. He paused when Snape spoke again.

"Have you thought that perhaps he has just become worried about you because he has just gotten to know you? You have been hiding yourself quite successfully these past years, and you still are hiding, to an extent. And, while you may think his worry is misplaced and that you are quite capable of caring for yourself, he is still much wiser than you. Remember that."

Draco didn't look back, nor did he answer. He didn't think Snape was expecting one.

Lupin's extra class was just letting out when Draco reached the DADA professor's room and there was only one student left inside, a familiar head of dark hair.

Lupin looked up from where he was showing Laney something in the book when Draco entered.

"Oh, Mr. Malfoy," he said. "I didn't realize you were making the potion this month."

"Hermione's a little busy this week," said Draco, noticing how the teacher seemed to be somewhat hesitant around him.

Still, Lupin took the potion from him without looking at it, or him, suspiciously. Lupin withdrew to the front of the room to force the potion down and Draco knelt by Laney's desk.

"Trouble with class?" he asked.

"The Boggart," said Laney.

"Oh," said Draco. He didn't know how to help her with this. He was assuming that Lupin was using the 'riddikulus' technique, and Draco never had managed to master it.

"Uncle Draco?" asked Laney hesitantly.

Draco looked at her, raising an eyebrow.

"Well, I was in the hall a few days ago and I saw you with a girl. You were kissing and all, does that mean you're going to marry her? Charity has a brother who's getting married and he's your age."

Oh, damn.

Draco sat in the chair next the Laney and tried to figure out how to explain this exactly.

"Laney," he began, and then stopped. His fingers flew in his pattern as he tried again. "Did your mother tell you anything about, well, guys and girls?"

"You mean like," here Laney looked around and then leaned in and whispered, "sex?"

"Umm, yeah, well, not that exactly, but dating and stuff."

"Are you dating her?"

Draco mentally groaned. "No, not exactly."

"But you were kissing her, a lot," said Laney.

"Yes," said Draco. "I was. And you are never to kiss someone unless you've been dating for a very long time, alright?"

"But you're not dating."

"Yeah, but, uh, I'm not really…I'm not doing it right. Don't do what I'm doing, alright?"

"Do you love her? Because if you do, then it's okay."

Merde.

"Laney," Draco began, and then stopped. How did one explain this?

"Are you being licentious?" asked Laney.

"Am I being what?" asked Draco, not confused by the meaning of the word, but surprised that Laney knew it.

"That's what mum said when people aren't dating and aren't in love but are having relations," said Laney seriously.

"Yeah," said Draco. "I'm being licentious."

Laney looked at him gravely and Draco slumped in his chair, running a hand through his hair.

"Shit."

Of course, once the word had left his lips he mentally kicked himself. First he was being licentious and now he was swearing in front of his eleven year old niece?

He looked over at Laney who was watching him with wide eyes.

"I'm sorry," he said.

She got up and threw her arms around him. Draco hadn't been expecting that and he froze.

"It's alright," she said. "I don't care if you're being licentious."

He slowly wrapped his arms around her, unused to the embrace but finding that it was comforting. He let his head rest on hers because there was a tightening in the back of his throat.

She pulled back after a bit and regarded him severely.

"You said 'shit'," she accused.

"Watch your language," said Draco.

"You said it."

"Yeah, well I'm licentious," said Draco. "You don't say it, understand?"

"I was using it in quotes."

"I don't care if you use it parenthesis," said Draco. "No swearing for you."

"When I'm older?"

"When you're eighty-two."

She giggled and Draco got up, eyes flickering to where Lupin was at his desk, involving himself in his grade book to give them privacy. Draco nodded once to the teacher and then left the room.

He found Pansy in the library at one of the desks in the back of the shelves. He stayed on the opposite side of the desk and waited until she looked up at him.

"I can't do this anymore," he said.

She raised her eyebrows. "I think that's the first time you've been the one to call it off."

"Yeah, well that was before I had a niece."

"And now you want to be a good example?"

"She said I was being licentious."

"Well, you are."

"And I would rather that she didn't become so. Do you need to keep it going for any reason?"

"Not particularly. I've proven that I could get you, it should be enough. I'll tell the others some made up stories and they'll be happy enough."

Draco nodded. "I'll keep an eye out for you."

"That's all I ask."

Draco nodded again and then turned around to leave, but Pansy spoke up, so he turned back.

"Draco, you should really think about finding yourself a nice girl."

"Merlin, Pansy. Don't you start too."

"I'm serious," said Pansy. "Find someone who isn't going to keep running after different boys. I was never right for you."

"Pansy, don't."

"I know that your mother-,"

Draco turned on his heel and walked away.

Unfortunately, the week was not over, nor did the week improve in any way.

Draco walked into DADA the next day to find a trunk holding a Boggart in the front of the room. He only half listened to Professor Lupin's lecture, knowing that there was no way he was going to get up in front of the class and show his deepest fear.

"While the Boggart is generally considered an easy opponent to defeat, once you understand the basics of the 'riddikulus' spell, it can still be quite dangerous if you do not posses your wand. Now, the basis of the 'riddikulus' spell is to laugh at your fear, but without your wand, you will have to face it, to talk to it. In showing the Boggart you are not afraid, and that you are not under the power of fear, you can impose your will onto the creature."

Remus unlocked the trunk. "Please line up," he said to the class, "and I will instruct you as you face the Boggart."

All of the students stood up and formed a line in the middle of the room, all the students except Draco.

"Mr. Malfoy," said Lupin. "Please join your classmates."

Draco shook his head. "I'm sorry Professor, I can't do that."

The class stared.

"Mr. Malfoy, this is part of the class assignment, and participation is required."

"And I cannot participate," said Draco. "Nor do I believe that broadcasting our private, personal fears in a classroom setting and in front of other people is entirely necessary or ethical."

"But this is a classroom setting, and by participating I will be teaching you how to counter these fears."

"I assure you that I am already capable of such a maneuver, but I am unable to participate in today's activity."

"You will receive a zero for a grade."

"That is acceptable."

"Very well, you may be excused."

Draco nodded, but then Nott raised his hand.

"I can't participate either," he said.

"Or me!" called out one of Nott's Ravenclaw cronies.

"Yeah, me neither!"

And then half of the class was calling out their excuses and Lupin was looking quite overwhelmed. Draco gathered his things and slipped out the door, unwilling to be in a room with a Boggart and with so many people.

Michael groaned, only aware that his head was throbbing with every beat of his heart and that it was dark, pitch dark.

There was a sharp pain as something heavy connected with his side and his eyes sprang open, solving the problem of the darkness, although it took him a few moments for his eyes to adjust to the light and a few more moments for him to blink his eyes into focus.

He was lying on a wood floor and there was a desk a little ways away, and sitting at the desk was a very worried, pale man with grey hair and brown eyes. He was being held in the chair by a man wearing a Death Eater's mask and it was apparent the old man wished to run to Michael, to see if he was alright.

Michael was hauled to his feet by another Death Eater and he was nearly ill at the sudden movement, his head emitting a flash of pain at the change of altitude and his vision swam. A hand smacked across his face and he could see again, see the Curator of the museum trying to rise, only to be thrust back down again by the Death Eater.

"Please," said the Curator. "Don't hurt him, just, don't hurt him."

"Then you had better start translating!" growled the Death Eater, cuffing the back of Jean Barret's head. "You've been stalling long enough!"

So the Curator had been trying to stall for time. Michael looked Jean Barret over, noticing the sweaty brow and the hands that trembled slightly. There were faint bruises on his face, and he sat hunched over, as if his ribs were hurting him, but he couldn't make out any injuries under the black robes.

"Don't do it," said Michael.

He was slammed face-first against the wall, biting down on a cry of pain. A hand twisted into his hair, pulling his head back and then smashing his face into the wall, once, twice, three times. He felt his nose break the second time, and felt the bones smash back into his skull the third and he yelled.

He was released and he toppled to the floor. "Don't do it!" he forced out again.

A foot connected with his side.

"Stop it!" commanded Jean Barret. "I'll do it. I'll translate it!"

"No!" Michael gasped, but then the foot was kicking again and he curled up as best he could.

"I said to stop it!" Jean was yelling, trying to get up, but the Death Eater holding him smashed his fist into the Curator's stomach and the old man fell out of his chair, still struggling, and Michael was struggling to get up, to stop them from harming the Curator. That's when the Death Eater pulled out his wand –

All Michael knew was pain, a fire racing over his skin and into his veins, racing along with his blood until his vision blurred and his ears rang, or that could have been his screaming, he wasn't sure.

When the Unforgivable was finally lifted off of him, he was gasping and just managing to hold onto reality, knowing that his Auror training had not prepared him for this.

"Don't," said the Curator. "I'll translate. I just need my books and journals. They are at my house in my office in my desk. Just go get them and I'll translate."

"Your journals?" one of the Death Eaters demanded. "You never said anything about needing the journals."

"That's because I was trying to trick you," said the Curator. "But now I'm not. Not now, not when-," he cut himself off.

"You had better not," said the Death Eater, and the two left.

Michael lifted his gaze to the Curator.

"Don't," he said.

Jean Barret shook his head, tears forming in his eyes. "I can't, Julien. I'm so sorry, I can't."

Michael shook his head, even as he felt the darkness rise up. "Dad, don't."

And then Julien Michael Barret let unconsciousness over take him.

Bill stared at the walls in shock. He had followed Draco's example and had posted sheets of paper over the walls and had written all over the paper, trying to figure out where the Curator had been going with his code.

Jean Barret had been close to deciphering the code, and had filled four green journals of the ciphers, and so it had only taken Bill three days to straighten his office and complete the code, and now he had it. If only he knew what 'it' was. The wording was a little vague.

It made since that the wording would be vague, after all, the code came from The Averne, which originated from a time when people loved to speak in riddles. Besides, the Latin that the code translated into was a slightly different dialect and the English translation was a little sketchy in parts. Each chapter of The Averne, or rather, each title of each chapter leant a word, or a few words (depending on the legnth of the title) to the code.

He sighed, cracked his neck, and looked at the translation again.

The Descent/Submersion (Bill didn't know what word it was yet; it could be both) an easy path. No doors bar the Road, but Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life is not easily returned/retraced. The Road not by water, so diverged by men. A Mantle/Veil of water woven to mark the way. Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life may be saved, but only with a prayer and -

And that was where the code trailed into the chapter written in the Persian Runes that Draco had not yet translated. Bill wondered what the code could be referring to.

He sat down to write a letter to Dumbledore, telling him of the code he had found and asking the Headmaster to discuss it with Draco, only if the teen had the time. It was while he was writing that an owl from Dumbledore came through the window.

Bill took the letter eagerly, wondering if the tomb of Merlin had been attacked yet, and if the Aurors had managed to capture the Death Eaters. He skimmed the letter and then threw it down in frustration. The Death Eaters still hadn't tried to attack the tomb of Merlin. What were they waiting for? They did want the cloak to attack Hogwarts, didn't they?

Bill put a kettle of tea on and waited for Michael to return with more news of the Curator. Michael was certain that he had met an informant who knew where the Curator had been taken, but the informant had been most uncooperative, making Michael meet him several times to determine that Bill's contact was not a Death Eater, ready to tell the others of the leak.

Bill glanced at the clock, seeing that Michael wasn't due for another fifteen minutes, and then he glanced back at the unfinished translation. He wondered if the Curator had attempted to translate the Persian Rune chapter.

Bill knew that Michael didn't want him out of the house unless it was absolutely necessary, but he was bored, and immensely curious, so he got up and started the Floo.

He stepped out into the living room of the Curator's house and headed for the office where he had been organizing for the past few days. He pulled open the desk drawers and began shifting through the journals, skimming through a few of them.

He found nothing and so wandered about the house, searching on any of the other bookshelves for any journals. He finally found what he was looking for in the bedroom on the bedside bookshelf, another green journal with the beginning attempts to translate the Persian Runes. It didn't look like the Curator had gotten very far.

Bill decided he would take the journal anyway, but in standing he noticed the photo on the Curator's dresser. He picked the picture up and stared. He knew who the teenager was in the picture, although the man was older now, but there was no mistaking the sandy blond hair or the blue-grey eyes. That was Michael. Why did the Curator have a picture of Michael on his dresser?

His conversation with Millie came back to him.

"He loved his work," said Millie. "And ever since his wife died, well, he hasn't had time for anything else, not even his son."

"How old is his son now?" asked Bill.

"In his twenties, I would imagine. I've only ever seen him once. His son wanted to be an Auror, and Jean disapproved. There was quite a falling out, but I think that Jean was mostly against the idea because he didn't want to lose his son as well."

Michael was Jean Barret's son; that was why Michael was so intent on finding the Curator. Michael had said that he was an Auror before Dumbledore had spoken to him about doing undercover work for him. It all made sense now.

Bill put the photo down and was just walking to the door when there was a crash in the living room. He froze as he heard voices.

"Shut the hell up, Andre."

"There's no one here to hear us."

"Yeah, well I don't want to attract any attention. Let's just get the journals and get out of here."

Bill crept closer to the door, not daring to peek out, but wanting to hear what the intruders were saying. He could hear them rummaging about the office, the sound of drawers opening and shutting.

"Alright, I think that's all of them," said Andre.

"Good, let's get out of here. That Curator had better be telling the truth about these journals, or I swear I'll kill his kid in front of him."

Bill's breath caught in his throat. They had Michael?

He snuck a glance out the door to see two Death Eaters step into the fireplace and once they were gone, he pulled out his wand. The Aurors would be able to trace that Floo within a five block radius, and Bill was guessing they had Floo-ed because they had put up Anti-Apparition wards. They were easily detectable and not common. He was betting the Aurors could find the Death Eaters' hideout quite easily.

Julien came back into consciousness feeling a hand stroke soothingly through his hair. He opened his eyes to find his father cradling him gently, his eyes frightened.

"Dad," he managed.

"Jules," said Barret, "how are you?"

Julien didn't want to think about that, knowing that if he allowed his mind to dwell on his injuries they would just hurt more. "M'fine," he said. "You?"

"Julien, I'm sorry," said Barret.

Julien shook his head slightly. "Listen," he said, wishing that his voice was more forceful than a whisper, but he couldn't quite manage the air flow. He had a feeling a few ribs were broken. "We know about the passage you have to translate."

"You do?" asked Barret.

Julien nodded. "It's okay to give them the translation."

"But you said not to before."

"I had to make it look convincing, but we have Aurors at the grave of Merlin."

"The grave of Merlin?"

"For the cloak," said Julien. "So it's okay to give them the translation."

His father shook his head. "You don't understand, Jules. I'm sorry. I'm sorry haven't talked to you in so long, I'm sorry I turned you out after Maria…after your mother passed."

"Dad, it's fine."

"No, no it's not. I should have been there when you graduated from school, and when you graduated from the Auror's Academy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I can't save you."

Julien frowned. "What?"

Jean sobbed. "I already gave them the cloak translation and I cannot complete the other, not even with my books."

The door burst open and the two Death Eaters strode in, arms full of journals. They dumped them on the table and Barret got up, lowering Julien to the floor. Julien pushed himself up so he was leaning against the wall, holding his ribs and trying not to move too much.

The Curator looked through the journals, then back up at the Death Eaters.

"They're not here," he said.

"What do you mean, not there?"

"The journals I need to translate. They're not here. I had five green journals with the code and they aren't here. You must have missed them."

"We didn't miss anything, old man. That's all of them, so start translating, or your little boy here gets it."

His father turned panicked eyes in his direction, then back to the Death Eaters. "Please, no. I just need the journals!"

"You have the journals. Now work!"

"But these aren't the right ones – No! Don't!" his father yelled when Julien was hauled up by his neck, gasping for air as he gripped the hand that squeezed around his throat.

"He can't breathe, old man. Get to work!"

Julien tried to gasp in a breath, but the hand was too strong. He gagged, panicking as he struggled, his vision going dark. He was shoved against the wall, still held by the throat, but the hand wasn't as tight and he was able to rasp in labored breaths.

The other Death Eater held up a knife in front of his face and then showed it to the Curator.

"No!" Jean shouted, his voice breaking. "I just need the journals. Please!"

"Well then, who has the journals?" asked the Death Eater.

"I-I don't know."

The knife slashed across Julien's chest, tearing his shirt and cutting into his flesh in the process. He couldn't scream because he didn't have enough air and so all that came out was a kind of strangled yell and he would have crumpled, but the Death Eater kept him pinned up on the wall.

His father screamed for him.

"Translate, old man!"

The knife was dug into his side, half an inch deep, and he gasped, struggling feebly.

"Please, no! Not him. Not my son."

The knife was dragged across his stomach agonizingly slowly, never going any deeper, but enough to slowly rip open his skin, blood spilling out and he squeezed his eyes shut, biting back the sobs.

That was when there was a crash and shouts in the next room.

"Shit! That's the Aurors!"

"Kill them and let's get out of here."

No. There was no way Julien was letting them kill him or his father now, not when rescue was so close.

He lunged forward, impaling himself on the knife but managing to topple the Death Eater. The Death Eater hit the floor, his head cracking on the wood surface and going still. Julien was already rolling off of him, adrenaline keeping him going more than anything.

The other Death Eater was raising his wand at him and there was blue light, a curse of some sort. Training kicked in and he managed to twist out of the majority of it, but it grazed him, and then he was falling back, hitting the floor, and the wand was raised again. This was it. He was going to die.

The Death Eater was shoved, his father tackling the man, fighting for the wand. Julien tried to stay conscious, tried to fight past the sleep that seemed intent on claiming him. His father was lunging again, there was a green light, and then his father was falling backwards, hitting the ground, lying still.

Julien screamed, but there was no noise. The door burst open, men in red robes appearing. His eyes locked once with a man with red hair and worried hazel eyes.

The man was yelling something, most likely 'Michael!' but Julien couldn't hear anything. The world was silent; a second later, it went dark.

The Death Eater had escaped, taking with him The Averne and also Jean Barret's journals, not that it would do them any good. Bill was in possession of the journals, and he was sending them out to Dumbledore as soon as he could, or, as soon as he was done being briefed by the Head Auror and as soon as he was able to visit Michael.

Raul Abney, Chief of the French Aurors, had known of the mission Bill and Michael, or rather Julien, was on and he had kept tabs on Julien's travels. When Julien had gone missing, he had just entered an abandoned house. The Aurors following him had been unable to follow and they reported nothing unusual, except, of course, the fact that Julien hadn't come out. They hadn't even seen the suspect.

"So we have no clue what this guy looked liked?" asked Bill wearily.

Raul smiled. "It wasn't a guy."

"What?" asked Bill.

"The house that the Death Eaters had taken over had a rather nosy neighbor, a Mrs. Edith Cheney. She reports that two men moved into the house accompanied by a blonde woman. From what reports we could gather, Julien met with her a few times before the meeting in the house where he was taken. We're still comparing notes with the bartenders where they met and with a few other sources, and we should have a rough ID by the morning."

Bill was impressed. "That's good work," he said.

"Well, we got lucky. The Death Eaters were employing similar strategies to Dumbledore. One person went out gathering information, the others stayed behind and did the dirty work. No one remembers seeing or hearing of the two men that bought the house, discounting the time when you heard them in the Curator's house. I'm betting those two were responsible for the kidnapping of Jean Barret as well."

"It's a smart move," said Bill. "No one can tie the girl to the kidnappings, because all she's doing is listening and asking around, making sure that no one's watching them. The men only come out to grab the Curator and look around his house. No one knows that they are there, so they can't be suspects."

Raul nodded. "It was a tight plan. We would like you to listen to some voices on record. We're hoping that maybe you can identify which are the voices you heard in the apartment, if the men have ever been convicted for previous crimes, of course."

"I'd be glad to," said Bill. "Have you had any word from the hospital yet? I'd like to see how Mic-Julien is doing."

"Julien's in a coma," said Raul. "They don't know if he's going to wake up, and his father was killed by the Avada Kedavra."

Bill shook his head. He had known that the old man was dead from the second he had entered the room, but he had thought Julien would have been fine. The Chief Auror seemed to read his thoughts.

"The knife wound inflected some serious damage to Julien's internal organs. By the time they stopped the bleeding, some stomach acids had seeped out, creating a severe infection."

"I thought we got him to the hospital on time," said Bill. "I just hope that this was all worth it."

The Auror nodded. "Sometimes, that's all we can do."

Yay! It's up. And remember, next update is Tuesday and because I know you all want to know because of the Boggart mentioned in this chapter, yes, Lord Draco will make an appearance in the next chapter. Leave a review if it makes you happy!





15. A Discussion with Fear

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. I do own the terrible caffeine headache developed after three hard-core days of coffee drinking. Because of this, I apologize if I haven't proofread very well.

Tdei: Wow. Seriously, your review was amazing. I've tried to respond to it after the chapter, so read it and let me know what you think. Thanks so much for taking an interest in my story.

R2D2: Whenever I learn a new word, I hear it used everywhere. Let me know if you do too! Thanks for the review!

Spyrit: Cool, a telepathic muse. I always knew I was special! Glad to hear that you liked the Draco and Laney interaction. They're always fun to write. Thanks!

Bena24: Yeah, I get a lot of comments on the Draco-Laney stuff, which makes me happy cuz I like to write it.

Anna: I'm going to have to look up that church in Munster. While I doubt Draco will be traveling there anytime soon, maybe in the third part of the series….thanks!

Sanjs: LOL, I hate PSAT's and SAT's and LSAT's and anything else with SAT in it, I'm mean, seriously, sat for a test name? Terrible. Thanks for the review!

Faith Maguire: Our school gave up trying to clear the ice off the paths, and it melted today, but it's just going to refreeze at night. Is your school the same way? Thanks for reviewing!

Dbi626: It's always bugged me in stories about how a character makes a sudden change, or the change becomes public, and all of a sudden everyone cares about them. It would drive me insane, and I figured it would Draco too. Thanks!

Freyalyn: I'm honored to hold your only steady review (it makes me feel warm and tingly inside!) and yes, Draco is awfully sure of himself. He'll figure out he needs help sometimes by the end of the story though.

Lilith: Guys with sexy hair makes my world go round. Well, that and guys with nice eyes, a nice smile, a nice bod…alright, so I guess it's just guys in general, lol. Especially the white-blonds though. Have you seen the Covenant? Stupid movie, but with hot guys…anyway, off track. Thanks!

Drewberry: Ah yes, the stupid Pansy cliché. I figure, she got in Slytherin for a reason, so did Crabbe and Goyle by the way, which means that they are ambitious, but I couldn't change their characters for this story. Thanks for the review!

Draco was serving a detention in Lupin's classroom for inciting rebellion. It turns out half of the class had refused to participate in the Boggart practice, which had completely upset the entire class period.

Draco knew that, for Lupin to gain control back, he had to give Draco a detention, but still, sitting in the empty classroom and writing lines while he could have been translating runes or working on a conceptual potion to counter Veritaserum was a much better use of his time.

He stifled a sigh and then set down his quill, flexing the fingers of his left hand for a moment. After eight-seven lines of 'Participation and practice are an important part of learning in the classroom', the muscles really started to cramp up.

He sat back as he stretched his hand. Lupin was at his desk, bent over a letter and frowning at it. Every so often he would jot something down on an empty page only to blot it out a few moments later. Draco wondered if he was trying to write a reply.

He picked his quill back up and began writing again. When he had just reached the ninety-second sentence, the door opened and Draco turned to see Dumbledore enter the room.

"Hello Draco," said Dumbledore. "How are the lines going?"

Draco didn't deign to respond, which only made the Headmaster chuckle. Draco watched as Dumbledore walked up to a much relieved Lupin.

"I told you I wasn't right for this," said Lupin. "I'm completely confused."

"But I appreciate you filling in," said Dumbledore. "May I suggest having Draco spend his detention helping you with this than writing lines?"

Draco jerked his head up at his name to meet Lupin's startled gaze.

"Albus, this is…confidential," said Lupin.

"Of course it is," said Dumbledore. "Draco, come up here. Lupin is our eighth translator who most graciously accepted my request for him to fill the last position."

"Draco is one of the translators?" asked Lupin, looking suitably shocked.

"Yes, Draco is translating for William," said Dumbledore. "They're great friends."

He seemed to delight in making Lupin's eyebrows reach his hairline in surprise.

Draco grudgingly got to his feet, although he was grateful to stop writing the lines. He didn't know how much longer he could force himself to sit still.

"The Gaelic Runes," said Dumbledore, handing him the letter.

Draco took it, skimming over the passage. He went back and read it over, then again. He then stared at the page for a good minute.

"I first thought it was the adjectives," said Lupin into the silence.

Draco glanced up to see the Professor studying him and Dumbledore twinkling at him.

"It's actually the proper nouns," he said, and walked over to the chalkboard. He picked up a piece of chalk and wrote out the message.

V ready to get the cloak. This week.

He handed the letter back to Dumbledore and then walked back to get his things. As far as he was concerned, detention was over.

"It doesn't make any sense, does it?" Dumbledore called after him.

Draco stopped and then turned around to face the Headmaster, arching his eyebrow.

"Severus will be up soon," said Dumbledore. "I wish to discuss a few things with you."

"Only if I am privy to some information," said Draco.

"Which information?"

"I want a list of the suspected Horcruxes."

"Done," said Dumbledore, and Draco frowned, having the feeling that the Headmaster was going to tell him anyways.

Snape chose that moment to enter the room, raising an eyebrow at the occupants, but shutting the door.

"Joining the Order, Draco?" he asked.

"Hell no," said Draco.

Severus snorted and joined Lupin and the Dumbledore in the front of the room. Lupin looked like he was still trying to figure Draco out.

"I recently got a letter from Bill," said Dumbledore. "Just yesterday his contact was kidnapped."

"What?" asked Draco.

"His contact was Julien Michael Barret."

"Jean Barret's son?" asked Draco.

Dumbledore nodded. "The Aurors found the Death Eaters' station, but not before Jean Barret was killed and his son gravely injured. Julien Barret is in a coma and so he is unable to answer any questions we may have, but we can make some inferences."

Draco raised an eyebrow.

"Jean Barret showed signs of torture, and then his son was brought in. We can assume then, that he was trying to stall for time and did not translate about the cloak, or at least, not until his son was captured as well."

"What evidence of torture was there?" asked Draco, taking a seat on one of the desk tops.

"He had many bruises on the face and torso. There was evidence of illegal potions in his bloodstream, including the Burning and Freezing potions. His nerves were also damaged, suggesting liberal use of the Cruciatus."

Draco frowned. "And on his son?"

"A severe concussion, from when he was captured, and again, facial and abdominal bruising as well as a broken nose. He too had been under the Cruciatus and he had a knife wound running down his chest, another across his stomach. He was stabbed when the Aurors' arrived."

Draco shook his head. "They shouldn't have brought the son in so soon," he said.

"Pardon?" asked Lupin.

"They were just starting the torture. The bruises on the face and torso mean nothing. Those are simply punishment, and to keep the prisoner off guard. If he talks, slap him in the face. If he moves and you don't want him to, punch him in the gut. Keep him believing that you are completely brutal and ruthless. Nothing works better than punishments much harsher than the crime committed because then the psychology begins working along the lines of 'If he beats on me for coughing when he wants silence, what will he do to me if I try to escape'. It's a wonderful scare tactic."

"They 'crucio'ed him liberally," said Dumbledore.

Draco shrugged. "That's my opening number," he said. "The crucio is the perfect torturing curse because it is relatively undamaging but still painful and considered the epitome of harm. It really isn't that bad if you think about it."

"Not that bad?" asked Lupin.

Draco shrugged. "It's not pleasant," he said. "But when it is not used to drive someone insane, it's considered mild by the Death Eaters; the only thing impressive about it, is the power it takes to wield the curse."

Lupin looked unconvinced. "There are many people who have felt the Cruciatus that would disagree with you," he said.

"If they just got off with the Cruciatus, they should feel lucky," said Draco.

"Have you ever-," Lupin began, but both Dumbledore and Snape shot him warning looks. Lupin regarded them curiously. "What?"

"Have you ever been under the Cruciatus, Professor?" asked Draco, turning the question on him.

"No," said Lupin.

"And because you have never been in the position of being captured by the Dark Lord, you don't know what else he can do. There are spells that can severe limbs and burn out eyes. There are spells to burn off the skin layer by layer, or to turn bone into nothing more than powder. All of these spells are irreversible."

"But then why aren't they considered Unforgivable?"

"Because they originated for use in medical purposes. In severe chemical accidents, a layer of the skin would have to be stripped, or in the case of the spitting blood cobra, the eyes would have to be purged so that the victim would survive. The Cruciatus curse was invented for pain, for torture. It was created so that it can only be used by hatred. An unstable wizard can cut off limbs, but he won't be able to use the Cruciatus, therefore the punishment is not for the use of the curse, but for the intent."

Lupin frowned, so Draco spoke again.

"The Dark Lord crucios his recruits to show them his power, and also to test their strength. He would not permanently harm his followers unless they had angered him."

"But it is still wrong to call it mild."

"That is your opinion."

"Until we have lived through the curse, it is not for us to say how 'mild' it is. People have been traumatized by it."

Draco rolled his eyes, knowing that there was no use arguing this point with a Gryffindor, and he didn't exactly want to come out and say 'I was under the bloody Dark Lord's Cruciatus four times, and after a few hours and a few sips of whiskey I was fine'.

"The point is," he said, somewhat coldly, "that the techniques used by the Death Eaters on Jean Barret are just the start. Mid-range would be broken bones, dislocations, lacerations, and etcetera. The high range would be dismemberment, starting with the toes and onto the fingers, followed by feet, and you get the picture. Normally, they bring in family members after the mid-range torture because even the Death Eaters get a little squeamish."

"You're saying that they broke routine," said Dumbledore. "Maybe they knew the Curator wouldn't respond to anything else."

Draco shook his head. "This technique is more similar to a bluff."

"A bluff?" asked Dumbledore.

"A bluff on the Curator's part, and bluff that the Death Eaters didn't buy. It usually involves a small concession on the prisoner's part. For example, a man takes a banker hostage. The man says 'Give me the combination to the vault'. The banker says 'I don't have the code to the vault, but I can give you the key to the register'. At first the robber takes the key, and goes along with it. Just as the banker gets comfortable, thinking he's going to be released, the robber brings in the banker's kid and says 'Give me the code to the vault or I shoot his brains out'."

"Jean Barret was protecting something more valuable?" asked Dumbledore.

Draco shrugged. "It could be that the banker really doesn't have the code to the vault, and so he tried to get away by just giving the key to the register."

"So your saying the Death Eaters wanted something he couldn't give them?"

"But he knew the Syrian dialect, which is what the code was written in. So he tries to get away with the bluff, the Death Eaters bring in his son, crucio him, and Jean Barret would have given up the cloak right then. There isn't a reason to knife his son."

"Actually, Barret might have been trying to stall for time," said Dumbledore.

"How so?" asked Draco.

"Bill found out that Julien was captured because he was at the Curator's house when two Death Eaters arrived looking for the Curator's journal and saying that if the old man was lying they would kill his son."

"It doesn't make sense. Using that type of stalling tactic doesn't fit his profile. He wouldn't have risked his son."

"What if he needed the journals to translate the cloak?" asked Severus.

Draco shook his head. "He was fluent in the Syrian dialect. He wouldn't have needed them."

"Maybe his son told him not to give the Death Eaters what they wanted," said Dumbledore.

"But Julien would have known that we had already translated the cloak chapter and that Aurors were guarding Merlin's tomb. He would have told his father to translate it." Draco frowned. "We're missing something. Why would they torture the son?"

"Maybe they were proving a point," said Lupin.

Draco shook his head. "Not with a knife, that would just make the Curator less cooperative." He thought hard, his fingers flying in their pattern. He finally looked up at Lupin.

"Could I speak with your Boggart?" he asked.

"I'm sorry?" asked Lupin.

"Not your Boggart as in your manifestation, but the Boggart you had for class. Could I speak with it?"

"It's in the trunk," said Lupin, pointing to a corner where a trunk lay ominously still.

Draco got off the desk and walked to the trunk, before pausing and looking over his shoulder. "This goes no further than this room," he said.

The men nodded, looking quite curious and then Draco opened the lid of the trunk and stepped back.

The pale hand appeared on the side of the trunk, and then the other. Lord Draco sat up much like a vampire did in the old Muggle horror films. His eyes, his glazed-over, blood shot eyes, landed on Draco and he broke into a manic grin.

"Congratulations!" He got out of the trunk and grabbed Draco's hand. "All on your way to ruling the world. First we gain their trust, then we loll-up back to dear Voldemort, show 'im what we've got and completely decimate the Order. I mean, the Dark Lord did just offer us heir to his throne. He's a nice guy, he is. And he took such an interest in us and, oh!"

That was because he had spotted the Professors in the front of the room. Lord Draco stared at the three teachers before turning back to Draco, looking somewhat affronted.

"Where's Bill?" demanded Lord Draco. "I liked him, well, I mean, liked him enough to kill him I suppose."

The three older men were staring at Draco's Boggart in shock. Draco supposed he couldn't blame them. This time Lord Draco was wearing a long, tight tunic of crushed velvet, ironically in a color somewhere between blue and purple, but one could argue either way. There was a good amount of black lace on the cuffs and silver buttons ran down the front of the shirt, stopping at the waist where the cloth separated to reveal black silk trousers tucked into hunter-green boots, again with a slight heel. Draco wondered if he was afraid of being short along with everything else.

"I heard that," remarked Lord Draco, turning to face him and then twirling back around to face the three men. "Introduce me," he ordered Draco.

"Professors," said Draco, coming to stand by his doppelganger, "this is Lord Draco. Lord Draco, this is Professor Lupin, Professor Snape, and Headmaster Dumbledore."

"A full moon, bloody hands that can never be cleaned, and a failed Harry Potter," said Lord Draco, clasping his hands together and grinning at all of them. "Of course, not only do I know that because I am a Boggart, but because I am Lord Draco, so I know all because Draco knows all."

"He hasn't learned etiquette yet though," said Draco. "You'll have to excuse him."

"Harsh," said Lord Draco.

"Sweet Merlin," said Snape, taking a step closer to Lord Draco, who took a step closer as well. Lord Draco peered into Snape's eyes, a mixture of intrigue and awe on his face.

"Your eyes are black," he said. "I can't see your pupils. I like it."

"Why isn't he changing into Severus' fear?" asked Dumbledore, turning to Draco with a frown.

Draco shrugged. "He doesn't want to," he said simply.

"He doesn't want to?" asked Dumbledore.

"I'm right here," said Lord Draco, frowning at Dumbledore. "If it weren't for your incredibly amazing robe, I wouldn't like you."

Draco grimaced; Dumbledore was wearing a purple robe with yellow stars and moons. It was hideous.

"Lord Draco, I need to talk to you," said Draco.

"Of course you do," said Lord Draco gleefully, clapping his hands. "I don't think you took me out to learn our new plan of conquering the world, because, well, you already know it." His face fell. "Which actually takes the fun out of it." He turned to Snape. "Do you want to hear it? I end up killing you."

He burst into laughter, twirled about, and then pulled out a vial of Angel Flight. Draco snatched it from his hands.

"Hey!" Lord Draco protested. "That's mine."

"You can have it when I'm done talking and you're done answering," said Draco.

Lord Draco sighed, collapsed onto a chair, and stuck up his feet. "Speak away," he said.

"You captured Jean Barret," said Draco. "Purpose is yet unknown, but he gives you something else, not what you originally took him for."

"Ah, a bluff concession," said Lord Draco. "I'm not fooled by it, but I'll play along, see what I can get."

"Alright, so he gives you the concession, you play along. Now what?"

"A shock to get him to answer my real question. I'd either chop off a limb, left hand works nicely, or go for his family." Lord Draco tipped his head to his side. "I've never chopped off a leg before, though. Maybe I'd go for the leg, to try something new."

"You actually take his son, smack him around a bit, and crucio him. What does Barret do?"

"What Lucius wouldn't do," said Lord Draco, smirking at him wickedly.

Draco ignored the barb and settled for glaring at Lord Draco.

"He gives in. Tries to cooperate," said Lord Draco, rolling his eyes and muttering something about his counterpart being 'no fun'. "He'll do everything it takes for his son's safety."

"Then why does he try to stall and ask for journals?" asked Draco.

"Because he needs the journal, idiot," said Lord Draco.

"He doesn't need the journal though. He has the Syrian Runes memorized."

"He needs the journals."

"But I just said-,"

"You're fixating."

Draco blinked, then groaned and ran a hand through his hair. They had been so sure that the Dark Lord had been after the cloak they hadn't taken in any other possibilities.

"That's the trouble with all of you," said Lord Draco. "You forget that the bad guys can have good luck too."

"The Dark Lord didn't know about the cloak," said Draco. "Not before he captured the Curator."

"Of course not," said Lord Draco.

"The cloak was the concession. The Dark Lord wanted something else."

"That something else would be in those journals-,"

"But even then the Curator couldn't give the Death Eaters what they wanted-,"

"Because his kid was knifed-,"

"Which means that even with the journals he couldn't perform."

"The cloak was the bluff,"

"Because he knew he couldn't do what the Death Eaters originally wanted,"

"And then when they grabbed his kid,"

"He tried stalling for time," Draco finished.

Lord Draco grinned up at him and held out his hand; Draco gave him the vial. Lord Draco tossed it back and his eyes glazed even further.

Draco turned to Dumbledore who was looking at them both, quite intrigued.

"Did you follow?" he asked.

Dumbledore nodded. "I think I know what Voldemort wanted." He pulled out a letter and handed it to Draco. "It's from Bill."

Lord Draco was immediately up and grabbing the letter from Draco. "Bill!" he sang out, dancing away from Draco and sitting on the teacher's desk. Lupin took a step back but Snape didn't; he was still studying the Boggart. Lord Draco stuck out his tongue at Lupin and then read the letter.

"'Headmaster, I have come across something quite interesting while going over Jean Barret's notebooks. He seems to believe that there is a code of sorts held in The Averne'. Wow, Bill has some really messy handwriting." Lord Draco nodded sagely and then continued. "'I have taken it upon myself', now how Gryffindor is that? 'I have taken it upon myself'." Lord Draco said the last in a snooty tone of voice which made him burst into laughter.

"Do you want to go back into the trunk?" asked Draco.

"I'll be good," Lord Draco promised. He read again. "'I have taken it upon myself to finish his work and have come up with the following. I would wish you to share this with Draco only if he isn't already over-worked.' Awww!"

"Lord Draco," said Draco, warningly.

"Fine, fine, fine. 'The translation reads as follows: The Descent, or the Submersion, an easy path. No doors bar the road, but Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life is not easily returned/retraced. The Road not by water, so diverged by men. A Mantle/Veil of water woven to mark the way. Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life may be saved, but only with a prayer, an offering, and the –

'That is all I have been able to translate as the remaining few words are in the chapter with the Persian Runes and I have yet to make heads or tails of it. Let me know what you think. Thank you, Bill'."

Lord Draco looked up at Draco. "Figured it out yet?" he asked.

Draco shook his head, frowning.

"The clue is in the title of the book."

"The Averne," said Draco. "Named for the ruler of the time, Avere."

Lord Draco sighed. "How are you ever going to conquer the world? Honestly, it's not that hard. The book isn't named for the king. It's something else."

"Since you figured it out right away it must mean that you came up with a different association for the word Averne, one that you would apply because you are, well, fear."

"More specifically, your fear of ruling and destroying the world," said Lord Draco.

"The Lake Avernus," said Draco.

"The supposed entrance to the Underworld," said Lord Draco. "How could you miss that one? Besides, it even says 'submerge' in the code. Submerge as in water. And submarines. I like submarines, especially ones that carry nukes."

"The 'diverged by men' line refers to the port that now lies in the Lake Avernus, a Muggle port. Before then, wizards lived by the shore. It was rumored that if one desired to bring a loved one back to life, they would have to enter the lake and go through a series of mazes and trials before proving themselves worthy. When the Muggles did move in, they said that the lady of the lake, a mystical being, wove a mantle out of the water so that the entrance to the underworld wouldn't be lost."

"And that is the mantle that it references," said Dumbledore. "Do you know what that is?"

"The Veil," said Lord Draco and Draco together. Lord Draco burst into giggles.

"See, we are the same!"

"The Veil in the Department of Mysteries," said Draco.

"Ugh," groaned Lord Draco. "When you rule the world, we're going to change that. I mean, 'the Department of Mysteries'? Cliché!"

"When I rule the world, I'll be sure to do that," said Draco.

Lord Draco smiled. "I'm holding you to it," he said, and downed another vial. He promptly became fascinated with his lace cuff, staring at it in wonderment and flicking at it.

"What would Voldemort want with the Veil?" asked Lupin.

Draco shrugged. "Anything that you know of inside of it?"

Lupin paled and Draco frowned. "What?" he asked.

"The end of fifth year," said Lupin. He swallowed roughly.

"What happened at the end of fifth year?" asked Draco.

"There was a battle at the Ministry. Sirius Black fell through the Veil. He was fighting Bellatrix at the time."

"Descend only for Death," whispered Lord Draco ominously. He then cackled wildly.

"Shut it," said Draco. "So, besides Sirius Black, whom I'm assuming the Dark Lord doesn't want, what's in the Veil?"

Dumbledore shook his head. "I don't know."

"That's because you're an idiot," said Lord Draco, waving his hand around to watch the lace fluff out. "Power hunger mad men only want one thing." He stopped playing with his cuff and looked around. "Does anyone know what it is?"

"Power," said Draco.

"Not you!" said Lord Draco, slapping him away. "Someone who isn't a genius. Merde!"

"So he wants more power," said Draco. "How does the Veil help him there?"

"He doesn't want the Veil. He wants his Horcruxes, he's fixated on them. They are his power. Now all you have to do is figure out how the two are connected."

Draco turned to Dumbledore. "You said you had a list?"

"Nagini was one, so was the diary of Tom Riddle. Voldemort regained Nagini's horcrux, and the diary was destroyed, as was Marvolo Gaunt's ring. Voldemort also kept one Horcrux in his body, so that accounts for four. Last year, the one in the cup was destroyed so that leaves us with two left. I believe that one is in Hufflepuff's cup, and Slytherin's locket."

"Slytherin's locket?" asked Draco.

"You know where it is?"

"Regulus Black was said to have bragged that he owned it, but he was killed long ago, by Bellatrix actually." Draco frowned, thinking back to the few times he had seen his aunt. "She did wear a necklace, but I could only see the chain. She kept the rest hidden under her robe." He looked up suddenly. "Bellatrix was sent to Azkaban earlier this year. Something about her having displeased the Dark Lord."

"She had the necklace and didn't tell him?"

"I fail to see how that would make Voldemort so angry," said Draco. "None of the Death Eaters even know of Horcruxes in the first place."

"Maybe she lost the necklace," said Dumbledore.

"Or maybe she was fighting, and the necklace had come out of her robes and someone, in the act of falling, had grabbed onto it…,"

"Sirius could have grabbed onto the necklace before he fell, taking it with him through the Veil."

"Which is a plausible explanation," said Draco.

"That means that Barret figured out the code was related to the Veil and the wrong people found out. I'll have Bill look into who had contact with the Curator, someone with connections to the Death Eaters."

"Barret," said Lord Draco. "Barrrrret." He giggled, then frowned. "I have a niece?" he asked, looking up at Draco. "We have a niece?"

Draco closed his eyes briefly, trying to push back the nausea. He had pushed all thoughts of Laney away as far as he could, and had used Occlumency to hide her, but Lord Draco was smart. He was smart. He opened his eyes. "I have a niece," he said quietly.

Lord Draco grinned, his smile becoming twisted. "I killed her. You killed her. Her and that Muggle whore!" He paused, the smile falling from his face, eyes going panicked.

He jumped off of the desk, stumbling away from the group, his face pale. He turned to Draco.

"I didn't," he said. "I would never hurt Laney. Never. You know that, I just, the potion, it was all the potion, and the Death Eaters had to be appeased. They had to know that I was truly with them, even if I was playing both sides but I never meant for that to happen. I swear, it wasn't supposed to happen. It's not my fault!" The last was a scream as Lord Draco tore at his hair, choking back a sob, or rather, choking back what passed as a sob from a boy who couldn't cry.

Draco swallowed hard. "I know," he said.

Lord Draco fumbled in his pockets, finally pulling out a vial and downing it again. He blinked and swayed, then turned back to Draco with the manic grin again.

"Actually, she was kind of obnoxious after a while. And she knew what I was doing, or at least, had an idea. Her and Sam. They were getting so…so judgmental. I really was going to keep them alive, I mean, come on, I am a genius here, I could have made it happen, but no, they had to be all disapproving and it just got me down. Merlin, the negativity was terrible. I mean, genius cannot blood under such conditions."

"Lord Draco, get in the trunk," said Draco.

The grin faded away.

"In the trunk," said Draco.

"I don't want to," said Lord Draco. "I like being us."

"In the trunk, now."

"You're stressed," said Lord Draco. "I have something to take care of that for you. It'll take all your worries away, of course, you already know that, and you know you want some."

"I don't want any," said Draco.

"Liar."

Draco sighed. "I want it but not enough to take it. Get in the trunk."

Lord Draco sighed. "Fine," he said. He got back in the trunk and began closing the lid, but he turned back to Draco. "You know," he said, "there's going to come a day, a day very soon where you won't be able to say no. And I'll be there, ready to be let out."

He laughed; the lid fell shut.

Draco let out a breath, running a hand through his hair and frowning when he felt the damp strands. He had been sweating? It wasn't that big of a deal.

"I have an essay to write," he announced to the room, not looking back at them. He gathered his bags and left the room. Dumbledore followed him, and Draco let the Headmaster catch up with him, but didn't look his way.

"Should I enquire about certain aspects of your Boggart?"

"Just ask Bill," said Draco wearily.

"You know, the fact that Lord Draco could withhold the pull to change into another fear is incredible. Your intellect has given a relatively mindless being the ability of thought. It also means your fear is that much more advanced than an average wizard, much more powerful. It would be an interesting study, sometime in the future, to see just what kind of capabilities your Boggart has."

"It would," said Draco. "But not now."

He felt the Headmaster's eyes on him, studying him, assessing him.

"Most assuredly not now," said Dumbledore. "Get some rest, Draco. Spending to much time dwelling on your fears is taxing, and in this case, especially for a genius."

Bill spent the night after the raid on the Death Eater headquarters listening to the recordings of any trial dealing with Voldemort in hopes that he could recognize the voice of the Death Eater that got away.

The Death Eater who had been captured was Andre Lawley, a small time criminal, but he had been killed in the skirmish. The fall had caused a severe blow to the back of his head and an artery had ruptured, killing him within seconds.

Bill had heard twenty-seven recordings and five voices had sounded familiar, but he couldn't distinguish them any further. He didn't even know if the Death Eater was even among them.

Still, he was going to listen to more recordings just as soon as he took a break for breakfast and visited Julien. He was joined by Raul Abney and the two sat in silence by Julien's bed.

"I'm having a team go through the safe house," said Raul suddenly. "If Julien had been meeting a Death Eater unknowingly, he also may have been tagged with a tracking beacon."

"You don't really think he would be, do you?"

"Nah. Jules is a sharp kid, but it is regulation."

Bill nodded. "I think Dumbledore will be pulling me back anyway."

"Do you know about when?"

"A few days, probably. Just enough time to pack my stuff, that is, if your Aurors don't make a mess."

Raul laughed. "I've got Oswald and Reynolds on the case. They're both pretty neat."

"Glad to hear it," said Bill. He drank the rest of his coffee and then stood up. "I think I'll head back to the station. I want to listen to the tapes of Lawley's original arrest and then his parole hearings. I figure our second Death Eater might have been in the nearby vicinity."

"Good luck," said Raul.

Bill sat through two more hours of tape before he heard the voice of the other Death Eater and he signaled the attending Auror over.

"I think this is him," he said.

The Auror listened in. "That's not a criminal," he said, "that's the parole officer for Lawley."

"That's what I thought," said Bill. "Do you have records of who Lawley's parole officer was?"

"The case was some fifteen years ago," said the Auror, "but I can already tell you who it is just by listening. That's Auror Oswald."

Bill blinked and then ran out of the room, barging into Raul Abney's office.

"Who did you say was at the safe house?" he demanded.

"Reynolds and Oswald, why?"

"It's Oswald," said Bill. "That was the voice of the other Death Eater."

Raul stood. "Are you sure?" he asked urgently.

"Positive."

Raul shook his head. "I thought he was just volunteering for the job because he wanted to help. He wanted to get in, that was his reason." He grabbed his wand. "I trust you are trained in defense?"

"Well, yes, but shouldn't we take a team?" asked Bill.

"He's an Auror. He'll be expecting that and he'll know the warning signs. It's just you and me."

Bill nodded. "I can get us through the Floo, but I'll have to go first, to take down the wards on the other side."

"Let's do it."

Bill threw the powder into the flames, calling out 'the Safehouse' and then he stepped through.

He came out the other end and was immediately on the defensive, but there was no one in the den, or at least, no one alive. Two bodies in red Auror robes were lying on the floor, eyes still open, but absolutely still.

Bill turned the hands of the clock on the mantle to twelve o'clock, disabling the ward on the fireplace, and then he checked the Aurors for signs of life. They were both cold to the touch; they had been Kedavra'ed and their badges identified them as Reynolds and Oswald. Someone didn't want the Auror turned Death Eater talking.

Bill heard a scuffle in the other room and he stepped over the bodies, wand at the ready. He peeked around the corner to see a figure in black robes shuffling through the desk, already holding the green journals and a stack of other parchment.

Bill felt a hand on his arm and he turned to see Raul beside him.

'Now!' Raul mouthed and they stepped into the adjacent room.

"Freeze!" Raul shouted. "We are the Aurors. Put down the papers and put your hands above your head."

The figure turned and Bill gaped.

"You?" he demanded.

"Hello, Professor," said Claire Jameson. "Give my regards to Draco, will you?"

Raul was already shouting out a spell, but Claire grabbed her necklace and a Portkey pulled her out of existence.

Bill ran forward, searching through his desk, hoping to find that the second drawer was full, but only the wood bottom stared back at him.

"No, damn it," he muttered, searching through the other papers that lined the desk, but it was no use. "Shit!" he yelled, spinning from the table and running a hand through his hair.

"What is it?" asked Raul, looking on in worry.

"She took the letters," said Bill. "The letters my contact and I were exchanging. The translated letters."

"She knows who your contact is," said Raul.

"Worse," said Bill. "I think she knows what he is."

"I don't follow," said Raul.

"Let's put it this way," said Bill, "what seventeen year old do you know that has translated an entire set of Ancient Runes that was thought to be undecipherable by every expert in the linguistic field?"

So, tomorrow I've got a statistics' test, a presentation in Spanish, and a chapter to present in psychology. I'm obviously overworked, so I think I should get a review from you to make my day more bearable. Please?

Tdei (in response to the amazing logical argument in your review): I suppose I should try to clarify my argument a little bit in hopes to at least salvage a part of it. Snape is saying that in order to define romantical love, and to prove its existence, it has to be experienced. A blind man will have the concept of color, just as Draco has the concept of love (through his relationship with Laney, Bill, etc.). While a blind man understands that color is due to light waves bending and occipital nerves and what not, it is impossible for him to know blue or purple (i.e. he cannot recognize it, experience it, or prove that it exists). It can also not really be explained to him.

Snape holds that love (true love, soul mates, etc) is like color. Someone who does not experience it, can only understand the concept, and so for Draco to say that he has the authority on the subject, and to say that it doesn't exist, is incorrect and presumptuous, nor can he really understand love, not until he has it or 'sees'. A person that is blind cannot be trusted to tell colors apart, nor can they prove that color exists, just as Draco is unable to disprove, or correctly categorize, love. Love is, after all, an emotion. Emotions can be recorded and explained and studied so that we can know the effect and cause of them, but until we feel them ourselves, do we honestly understand them, or are we just understanding their concepts and definitions?

As for hues, there must be a color perfectly in between blue and purple, but it would be impossible to get that exact hue as we don't have a set standard for colors. Because of this, people will always argue about those blue-violet colors….I don't know if I've really answered your argument though. It was really good.

Random question: Are you a behaviorist psychologist or are you familiar with their research, because your argument is vaguely reminiscient of them.

Sanjs: Thanks for wishing me luck, I think I did alright. And I hope you do get rich, because I will so write stories for you, lol. Thanks!

RainyStar: I've been in a few stage performances, and the show week sucks because the other teachers just don't seem to get that you don't have any time what so ever for homework. Hope it went well and thanks!

Lilith: There is something hot about bad boys, I definitely agree with you there, and I really do think that RAB is Regulus, just because it makes sense.

Mask: Stats are nasty, but then you won't have to take it in college!

Spyrit: Hey, it's fine. I understand perfectly the pressures of school and what not. And I do love Lord Draco, but – actually, I just dropped my laptop while writing that, oops. But Freddie's still alive, don't worry, I will get around to posting this chapter sometime tonight.

Freyalyn: I actually have started keeping an outline, just because I have to figure out what is going where and it was getting kinda complicated, but it's fairly straight forward now. Thanks!

Drewberry: Yup, Claire killed Oswald, simply because he knew too much and because he could be a liability. And she knew it was Bill because there were names on the letters that were decoded. Thanks

Draco was woken early in the morning by a knock on his door and he groaned because, as it was Saturday, he had been hoping to sleep in. The last few days had been trying, more so than trying, and he just needed to take a day off. Apparently, it was not to be today.

Draco rolled out of bed and crossed to the door, pulling it open to find none other than Harry Potter standing nervously in the doorway.

"The hell?" Draco managed, swiping a hand over his eyes in an attempt to wake up. Normally he would be wide awake at the intrusion, but he was physically and mentally drained.

"I need to talk to you," said Harry.

"Apparently," said Draco. "Couldn't it wait?"

"No."

Draco sighed. "I'll be down in a minute."

He shut the door in Potter's face and then leaned back against it. What could Potter honestly need at six in the morning on a Saturday? Still, Potter seemed to think it was important, so Draco supposed he should at least hear what the Gryffindor had to say.

He pulled on some clothes and then went the bathroom to splash water on his face. Feeling much more awake, he walked down the stairs to see Harry and Hermione seated on the couch and he resisted the urge to turn around and go back to bed.

He collapsed in his armchair and surveyed them. "What?" he asked, rather testily.

Harry hesitated and Hermione reached over and squeezed his hand. That seemed to encourage the Gryffindor who looked him in the eyes.

"Remember over the summer when you came to pick me up?"

"Yes."

"And do you remember what we talked about? About how I knew you were safe to trust because I saw you refuse the Dark Lord?"

Draco knew, from Hermione's lack of a response that Harry must have told her, and he frowned.

"Get to the point."

"I had another dream last night," said Harry. "Or a vision, or whatever it is that they call it. It concerned you."

Draco arched an eyebrow and merely waited for Harry to continue.

"In it was the student teacher from last year, the one that turned out to be a Death Eater. She had a bunch of letters or something, and she said that they were written in code and that you and Bill Weasley were writing to each other and sending information."

Draco frowned, sitting forward. "Did she have anyone with her? Was there an attack?"

"I don't know," said Harry. "She kept referring to spies and contacts. It was hard to follow."

"She was referring to a Ministry-run operation where information is sent through a variety of contacts and codes to keep the Death Eaters in the dark about what we know," said Draco. "My contact was Bill Weasley, now I need to know, did she say something about an attack or a raid or anything?"

Harry shook his head. "She just said she broke into the safe house and grabbed the papers, that was it."

Draco nodded, feeling a sharp relief at the news that Bill was probably still okay.

"You're not supposed to be able to tell him that," said Hermione. "You swore you wouldn't say anything."

"I swore," said Draco, "but my name isn't my own anymore, not since I've gotten disowned so it didn't apply."

"There was something else," said Harry. "She was talking about the language you used. She said it was supposed to be indecipherable, that no one had been able to translate it. She seems to think that you did."

Draco felt the beginning of fear creep into the back of his mind; the Dark Lord was smart and he must have realized Draco had cracked that code. It wasn't just that the Dark Lord knew; it was that soon other people would know, and he wouldn't have anymore control. The secret, that he had only just begun to feel comfortable with hinting at, was going to be blown wide open.

"She thinks that I cracked it, you mean," he said, going for the nonchalant.

"She thinks that; Voldemort thinks that."

Draco scoffed, his instincts kicking in, the denial already forming on his lips, but Harry spoke over him.

"He thinks you're a genius."

Draco paused. "What?"

"Voldemort. When I have these dreams, I'm him. He thinks that you translated that material because he used Legilimency on Bill before, and he knows that he couldn't have translated it, or at least, not in another ten years. He's seen you though, and met you. It makes sense to him because you answered his questions right, and you withstood the crucio, and because you're father's smart."

Draco didn't answer. He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.

"Are you?" asked Harry. "I know you're smart, but are you really some sort of genius?"

Draco opened his eyes and stared at the Gryffindor.

"Does it really matter?" he asked.

"Yes," said Harry.

The Common Room door opened and Dumbledore rushed in, followed by Snape. They stopped when they saw the three students by the fire. Draco noted the letter held in Dumbledore's hands, knowing it must be from Bill. Honestly, why did the former Professor always write Dumbledore in these cases and not send the letter directly to him? It wasn't like he couldn't handle the information, though he supposed Bill wanted the information to be broken to him gently and that was something rather difficult to do in a letter.

"I already found out," he said to the Headmaster.

Dumbledore looked somewhat startled and Snape was frowning so Draco explained.

"Potter had a vision about the Dark Lord. Claire Jameson was in it and she had the letters Bill and I exchanged."

"And Voldemort?" asked Dumbledore, looking at Harry who knew what the Dark Lord knew, but Draco spoke up.

"He knows. He figured it out, figured me out."

There was silence in which Draco sat back in the chair, concentrating on only letting one thought cross his mind at a time. He needed to remain calm, to think objectively.

"You don't have to stay here," said Dumbledore. "I can arrange for you to take the NEWTs now, and then you can be moved into the Order Headquarters. You wouldn't have to join if you didn't want to."

"I'm staying here," said Draco.

Dumbledore and Snape exchanged looks; so did Harry and Hermione. Draco rolled his eyes.

"Draco," Dumbledore began, "Tom does not like to be lied to."

"Does anyone?"

"He will take this personally. He is not one to accept failure."

"Neither am I."

"He knows that you translated the runes. He'll be after you to gain the rest of the instructions on how to pull the Horcrux from the Veil."

"I know."

"He knows of a cloak that can get him inside of Hogwarts."

"And when he takes it, we'll know to be on guard."

"Draco, you are in danger here."

"So is Potter and you're letting him stay here."

"He will only go after Harry when he thinks he can defeat him. To get more power he needs you, and in your belief that you can take care of yourself, you will only be more vulnerable."

"I've been eluding him my entire life."

"But this time he will be using your father against you."

That last sentence was followed by a silence in which Draco lifted a hand to rub his temples.

"Draco," said Snape gently. "Lucius is loyal to the Dark Lord. He will help him."

"I know," said Draco, the words coming out more quietly than he liked.

"Lucius is exceptionally sharp, and you are his son. He will tell the Dark Lord to go after Laney if need be."

"Then get Laney out of here," said Draco. "Send her to the bloody safe house."

"I have sent a letter to Samantha," said Dumbledore. "I am waiting her reply, but for now, we need to discuss what you will be doing. You are of age; I cannot send you from the school, but I do recommend it."

Draco was silent for a moment, his brows furrowed, but then he shook his head. "I refuse to be intimidated by him."

"Don't be a bloody Gryffindor," said Snape. "Leaving is your best option. The one that will keep you alive."

"We're all going to die eventually, and, for most of us, sooner rather than later as there is a war going on."

Dumbledore studied him, and Draco stared right back, raising an eyebrow at the Headmaster.

"You think that if you are kidnapped by Voldemort, you could escape," said Dumbledore.

Draco flushed, ever so slightly. The Headmaster's statement wasn't exactly what he had been thinking, but it was close enough. "He knows that I've cracked the code, not everything else. He has a habit of underestimating people, and I don't doubt that I'll be one of them."

"This is foolishness, Draco," said Snape.

"It appears to be foolishness to you because you can't understand my reasoning."

"And now the arrogance sets in, the belief that you can't be fooled or outsmarted. I'll have you know, Lucius is prey to that same fault as well."

"Lucius isn't as smart as I am."

"No, but he, and the Dark Lord, have been alive for far more time than you have. You may be smarter, but they have experience on their side."

"I'm not leaving the school. That is my decision and it is final. Now if you don't mind, I'm exhausted, and it's way too early in the morning. So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to bed."

Draco got up and started up the stairs, but then he turned around. "I trust you are pulling the other contacts and spies out of the field, Headmaster?"

Dumbledore smiled. "I thought you would be able to speak of the operation without consequences. Yes, we are pulling them out. Now that Voldemort knows what we are doing, he will be able to spot our operatives."

Draco nodded. "Good. And good day."

With that he turned around and started back up to his room.

He did not go back to bed, but rather took a shower and dressed. Once he was up, he was usually up for the day, and even if he had the ability to fall back asleep, he doubted he would after receiving information like that. The Dark Lord knew he was a genius, which meant that the Dark Lord would be coming after him.

Still, a unique opportunity had presented itself at this time. The code in The Averne spoke of what was needed to make the Veil passable, but as of yet it was incomplete. Draco was sure that the last bit would cite an ancient artifact that was needed, as most ancient rituals required. He needed to figure out the last of the code before Voldemort came because then he could set up some sort of alert system. This way, when he did tell Voldemort what was needed, and the Death Eaters went to retrieve the items, the Aurors would be forewarned, and could track the Death Eaters back to the Headquarters. Draco could hold out until the Aurors came, besides, Voldemort would need him to translate, and he wouldn't risk harming Draco.

Then again, the Dark Lord must know that Bill could read the runes, and Bill was smart, and could probably translate to the second dialect as well. He probably also knew, as Bill and Draco were writing letters, and as Claire no doubt had told him that Bill and Draco had been working together after class last year, that Draco and Bill had formed some sort of friendship, which meant that Bill could be used against Draco as well as Laney. Draco grimaced and then opened his door intent on starting to translate the Persian dialects.

It was a good thing it was the weekend because Draco didn't think he would be able to concentrate on anything besides the runes. He had to translate through the fourth and third dialects before making his way to the second and the work was intricate and time-consuming. He worked straight through lunch without realizing it, and once he had, he worked until dinner.

Blaise frowned when Draco joined him at the table for the evening meal.

"I haven't seen you all day," he said.

"I'm busy," said Draco shortly.

Blaise was silent and merely watched his friend shovel food into his mouth.

"Hungry?" he asked.

"Missed lunch," said Draco, in between bites.

"How'd you manage that one? It's the weekend."

"I'm working on a project."

"And is this one of those projects that require a certain high level of intelligence that you don't really like to talk about?"

Draco dropped his fork and he turned to face Blaise. "What?" His tone was cold.

Blaise shrugged. "You do realize that we have lived together for six years in the same dorm, and of those boys, I am the only one that really talked to you?"

"The point?"

"You read advanced texts for fun. You're obviously really smart."

For some reason Draco felt like throwing something, or screaming, or, better yet, hexing someone. Did everyone know his secret now? Did he have any privacy whatsoever? Why did people insist on figuring these things out about him and then refuse to inform him of their insight?

He turned back to his meal, not deigning to respond to Blaise and then leaving right after he ate. He hadn't even gotten the fourth dialect translated, and he wanted to have it done as soon as possible.

He actually succeeded in translating the fourth dialect by Sunday night, but only because the dialects turned out to be quite similar, something he was thankful for. He didn't know when the Dark Lord was going to attack, and that knowledge kept him continuously on guard. It was because of that strain that he nearly pulled his wand on the figure sitting in his Common Room when he walked in late that night.

"Whoa," said Bill Weasley. "It's just me."

Draco frowned, letting go of his wand and walking further into the room.

"What are you doing here?"

"No, 'hello, Bill, it's good to see you'?"

"Hello, Bill, it's good to see you. What are you doing here?"

Bill laughed and stepped forward to pull Draco into a hug, which Draco bore with ill grace.

"Did Dumbledore send for you?" he asked, crossing to his armchair and sinking into it. Bill took the chair across from him.

"He may have said something about being worried for your safety."

"And I suppose you've come to tell me that I should skip off to the Order as well?"

Bill shrugged, looking extremely unabashed. "I think it's a good idea," he said.

Draco rolled his eyes; Bill leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees.

"Look, Draco, Voldemort will come specifically for you."

"And if he doesn't find me here?" asked Draco. "Then what?"

"There is an evacuation plan in place," said Bill.

"Then I can get out fine."

"Look, Draco, it's not as if retreating is a bad thing to do sometimes."

"I know. I am a Slytherin."

"Then why are you staying?"

Draco hesitated slightly and Bill groaned, sitting back and running a hand through his hair.

"Don't tell me you have some sort of plan that involves you being kidnapped by Voldemort."

Draco didn't answer, but his silence spoke for him.

"Draco, he's called the Dark Lord for a reason. He'll kill you."

"He can't kill me," said Draco. "I have to translate for him."

"You know what I mean," said Bill. "He'll hurt you, torture you, to prove a point."

"Why can't you just trust me on this?"

"Because someone has to look out for you, and using yourself as bait some crazy scheme that I can't quite follow isn't sounding too smart."

"It is," said Draco.

Bill rolled his eyes; Draco frowned.

"Draco," Bill began, and then he stopped. He sighed. "Alright, what's the plan?"

"I figure out, before the Dark Lord comes, what else is needed for the Horcrux removal from the Veil. Then, when I do get caught by the Dark Lord and when I do give him the list of what is needed, Aurors or Order members can be watching said items, and follow them back to the headquarters."

"I like this idea better. We get you and Laney somewhere safe. You decode the runes. We figure out how to pull the Horcrux out and do it ourselves and then destroy the Horcrux."

"Because my way not only would we get the Horcrux, but we will also be taking out a portion of the Dark Lord's army."

"But my way we wouldn't be risking one of the greatest assets we have against Voldemort."

"Flattered, I'm sure," said Draco dryly.

Bill pinched the bridge of his nose; Draco wondered why he was getting so frustrated. His plan had the best outcome.

"Draco," said Bill seriously. "There are so many things that could go wrong with your plan, and I do not want to leave you stranded with Voldemort and a house full of Death Eaters. It's too risky."

"If anything goes too badly, Snape will know, and then he can tell the Order. I'm sure you'll think of something."

"Right, and while we're thinking, the Dark Lord can just crucio you to death. Excellent plan, Draco."

Draco ignored that last bit. "We'll have to take certain precautions. I want Laney to be moved to the safe house, as well as Samantha. You should stay there as well, as well as the rest your family too. The Dark Lord probably knows that you and I get along, and I don't want to be forced into doing anything."

Bill seemed to get angry at that last bit.

"Oh, so I can stay at the Order but you can go and throw yourself at the Dark Lord?"

Draco frowned. "I'm just saying-," he started, but Bill cut him off.

"Don't you think that's a bit of a double standard? I can hide, but you can't?"

"I can take care of myself, Bill. If other people are put into the equation, then things could get complicated."

"Draco, you can't do this all by yourself."

"Can't I? I seem to be doing a pretty good job in facing down the Dark Lord so far."

"But you couldn't seem to make up your mind about Voldemort by yourself."

That was a low blow, and Bill knew it. Draco glared and walked over to the fireplace. He heard Bill sigh behind him.

"I didn't mean that."

"Of course you did. Isn't that why you said it?"

"Fine. I did mean it. It's the truth and you know it."

"So what? Out of gratitude I'm supposed to do your every bidding? Follow your every order out of some warped life-debt? We're even, I'll have you know."

"I'm not saying that. I'm saying that you need to realize you can't to everything on your own."

Draco bit back a frustrated groan. "Why is everyone saying that?" he demanded. "I'm doing things on my own because that's the way I have been doing them for seventeen years now and it has worked fine, only for some reason, now everyone has it in their heads that they have to look after me and provide back up and support!"

"You've been doing that for seventeen years because for that long you've been playing your own side."

"I'm still playing my own side."

"But now your path has brought you alongside the Order, and we're going to give you support because that is the way all of us are most likely to survive this war, and that's not exactly a bad thing."

"I don't want your support."

"But maybe you need it."

"Maybe I don't."

"Stop being so difficult, Draco."

"I'm being difficult? The whole lot of you is being difficult. You all just think you know best, don't you?"

"There is no arguing with you, is there?"

"Not when I'm right."

"Merlin curse that mind of yours, because it's going to get you killed one of these days. When will you accept that sometimes we may have a point, that we may have the right idea?"

"When it becomes so glaringly obvious that I can't ignore it, and when even I can't think of anything else to attribute it to."

"Damn it, Draco. We're worried about you."

"Get over it," Draco snapped back.

His comment was met with silence, but Draco knew that his retort hadn't been warranted. He sighed and walked back down to his seat, dropping into it and running a hand through his hair.

"It's my decision, and I think it's the best option there is. I'm not a Gryffindor, so don't think for a minute that I'm going to put myself in any unnecessary danger. This is just too good of an opportunity to pass up on."

Bill sighed, but in a defeated kind of way. "I'm holding you to that," he said. "And I want you to take a Portkey with you, just in case something goes bad."

"There will be wards up against portkeys."

"You're a genius. You'll figure a way to get the wards down."

Draco smirked. "I'll take a Portkey," he agreed.

"And you use it, if something goes wrong."

"Sure."

"Swear it."

"Don't trust me, Bill?"

"Not on your life." The humor was grim.

"I swear, if something goes wrong, I'll use the Portkey."

"Good," said Bill. He smiled at Draco. "I take it your not enjoying all the attention?"

Draco merely gave him a look. Bill laughed.

The glass of brandy was held in strong fingers, but the grasp was somewhat lax, as if the brandy had been forgotten. The figure holding the expensive crystal glass was sitting on an expensive gold brocade armchair. Sitting was the wrong word, but lounging inferred a sense of laziness and sprawling was too undignified. Reclined might be closer to the truth of it, but the armchair was relatively straight-backed.

Either way, the manner in which the figure sat was a position which invoked an image of relaxation, but yet there was also a sense of unspoken power which caused all who approached him to immediately be on their guard, or rather, if anyone approached him, but no one was.

The hand holding the brandy shifted, and the firelight caught the amber liquid and bounced off, sending a few spots of reflected light to dance along the Oriental rugs that lined the floor, adding to their intricate patterns. The man finally seemed to remember the brandy, because he took a sip and then his cold grey gaze returned to the fire.

The door behind him opened, and the grey eyes slid up to the mirror lying on the mantle and then returned back to the flames. The intruder did not seem to be affected by the man's daunting aura, for he radiated his own, one of darkness, but neither did the seated man shrink from the other's presence.

"Lucius," said the man.

Lucius Malfoy raised the glass to his lips once again, taking another sip.

The man walked closer and Lucius looked up at the mirror once more, meeting Voldemort's red gaze reflected in the glass.

"Milord," he said mildly. His tone said nothing of inner turmoil or conflict, nor did his eyes reflect any disconcert. Then again, there simply may not have been any conflict to hide. No one could ever tell what the Malfoy patriarch was actually feeling, not even the Dark Lord.

"Your son is quite the…unexpected."

The Dark Lord's tone was equal mild. They could have been discussing the weather.

Lucius tilted his head in response, though be it a nod of acquisition to a point, or the acceptance of a compliment, it was impossible to tell. Lucius drained the rest of the brandy and then stood, crossing over to the liquor cabinet kept on a polished mahogany table. He set the used glass down gently; it was part of an expensive set. He turned to his visitor.

"Brandy?" he inquired. "Or perhaps a bourbon?"

"Whatever you think is best," responded his guest. It was an unspoken challenge, one that Lucius had played many a time. It was not an easy thing, keeping the position of right hand man to a ruthless dictator. Still, Lucius had remained so ever since he was promoted to the rank of advisor and confidante of the Dark Lord. He was a Malfoy, and no one else could over take him when it came to power plays, not even when he was handicapped by a dissenting son.

He poured an inch of whiskey in another crystal tumbler and then handed it to the Dark Lord, who took it with a slight smile, though not one of amusement.

"You do realize, Lucius, that I will kill your son."

Another test. To say 'Yes, milord, go ahead' would be to endorse an unwise action. Any man who could translate the Persian Runes would be a welcome ally, willing or not. To say 'Please, milord, not my son' would be to deny the Dark Lord.

Lucius walked back to the liquor cabinet, pouring himself another half-inch of brandy.

"My son is already dead, milord," he said, his voice even and collected. "Who is it you speak of?"

The Dark Lord seemed pleased with his answer; he always was.

"I need information, Lucius, on your late son. How is it you never noticed his potential?"

Ah, there was the question. It had been turning over in his own mind so many times.

"I do not claim to be a particularly attentive father. I consider my business to be my first and foremost concern. Perhaps it was unwise to not form a stronger connection with him, perhaps I could have prevented such circumstances, but what is done, is done."

"You never suspected."

"I knew he was intelligent, and took pride in his work, but no. He was a Malfoy, first and foremost, before he was anything else."

"Will he run from Hogwarts now that I know what he is?"

"No. He will be there. If he is anything, he is confident in his abilities."

"And what inspiration with he need to translate the runes for me?"

"He is no doubt already translating them now in hopes to get the Horcrux first."

"That is no matter. I already have the cloak and I can attack anytime I need to."

"Then I would suggest taking others as well. He has denounced you, no doubt out of some new found moral belief. He would not be able to withstand the suffering of others, not when he can prevent it."

"You believe this?"

"He would not wish to be the murderer of children."

"His niece perhaps?"

"Do not take the girl."

"No? Is this some affection I detect? Are you fearful that your name will not be carried on, so you resort to a Half-blood of illegitimacy?"

"He will be sure to get his niece away from the attack. Going after her would merely waste time. Other children will produce the same results."

"Very well, I shall trust your judgment. He is, after all, your son."

Lucius watched the Dark Lord leave and then poured an additional inch of brandy in his glass before retiring to his chair once more to think. Yes, that was the trouble, wasn't it? He was his son.

Still, he had made his choices, and Lucius had made his. His son was dead; both were dead.

It was easier to think that way with the brandy.

Well, that's all folks (for now). I think, not next chapter, but the chapter after will be the attack on Hogwarts, so things are picking up!





17. The Evacuation

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I could pay someone to take my tests for me, which is sounding so lovely right now.

Author's note: So, I said the attack on Hogwarts in two chapters. I lied. It's in this chapter, so stop reading this note and go read the chapter. I mean it. Stop reading this. Right now….lol.

Freyalyn: Noted on the 'figured out'. I shall, when I re-vamp the series, fix that. And I actually did picture Harry with his hand over Hermione's mouth when Draco revealed he avoided the spell. I'm glad you like the Lucius portrayal, and yes, arrogant Draco is hot. That's why I write him like that (smiles!).

Lilith: LOL! I'm sorry, but there is Blaise in this one and an explanation. And you know that there is a part, a very small part, but a part none the less that actually likes the D/G pairing. Anyway, I don't know how many chapters are in this one. I know that it ends, but chapterwise, umm, ummm, ten more maybe? So around thirty. We'll see.

R2D2: I hope you did okay on the test even though there wasn't a Draco to help you. And of course the plan will go wrong, just cuz it's more exciting that way. Thanks for reviewing!

FaithMaguire: I like those reasons for reviewing, lol. And yes, Draco is getting a bit snotty, but hey, there has to be something wrong with him, right? Thanks for the review!

Anna: Glad you caught up, and that you're excited for the next chapter. I've started writing ahead because I find writing them a blast, so I hope that means they're really good.

Sanjs: Hope you feel better. If so, here's a chapter to celebrate, if not, well, you can just sit and read and feel miserable. Hope you feel better soon!

Mask: Alliteration is catchy….see you soon!

It seemed as if everything that could be shoved into a week was. Draco had four tests as well as a ridiculously long essay due in Transfigurations, and he needed to get an E on this essay which meant that he couldn't write it while translating the Persian runes.

Potions wasn't much easier, and they were brewing complex elixirs for the entire two hours they were in class, so that Draco couldn't do any of his homework for other classes while making the potion.

There was also the knowledge that the Dark Lord had yet to retrieve the cloak of Merlin, and Draco didn't know what the self-proclaimed lord was waiting for. He had tried to think of reasons why the Dark Lord might be waiting to steal the cloak, but he had drawn a complete black. That only added pressure on top of everything else, and he had just managed to finish the fourth dialect by Monday morning. He had two more to go.

He was spending all of his extra time on the runes, knowing that finding the rest of the code, and consequentially, the artifacts needed for the ritual was key right now. Once he knew the artifacts, then he could have Dumbledore warn the Aurors, and then it was a simple matter of acting and fooling the Dark Lord and making sure not to get killed while he was the prisoner of the Death Eaters. But everything was resting on him translating the rest of the code. If he didn't have that, plan A wouldn't work, and there was no plan B.

He knew Dumbledore was getting concerned about his work ethic. It consisted of late nights, finally grabbing two or three hours of sleep at around three in the morning and then he was up again to do his homework for class and squeezing in another half-hour or so on the runes. Then it was breakfast, where Draco made sure that Laney was going to be okay. Samantha didn't want Laney to be anywhere that Draco was not, something which actually made Draco consider going to the safe house, but he settled for planning out every conceivable escape plan for the girl.

After the morning meal, which consisted of coffee and some toast, he would go to class, during which he slept when he could, and when he couldn't, he worked on the runes again. He worked through lunch, taking a sandwich back to the Common Room where he might actually eat it while pulling more work on the runes. He worked on the runes during his afternoon classes as well, and then he worked straight to dinner where he would check on Laney again.

In the evening, Granger and/or Potter would join him in the Common Room, dropping hints about how he should take a break now and then. When even their bickering couldn't keep him awake, he would take a shower, drink another cup of coffee, and work until late.

McGonagall was hell to deal with whenever she caught him sleeping or working on the runes. He wondered what she would say if he finally lost it and admitted that he was trying to translate runes so that he could undermine the Dark Lord.

Defense class was much better. Lupin knew what was going on and he had excused Draco from class because the spell they were studying was proven to cause migraines to a select few and Draco was, at least for the week, one of those unfortunate souls. Draco's opinion of the werewolf teacher rose a good deal.

Even so, it was Thursday now and Draco was almost done with the third dialect, which meant there was only one more to go after that, which was good. The Dark Lord hadn't taken the cloak yet, but he must be getting near to it.

While he was loath to admit it, Draco was…anxious. He was constantly checking up on Laney, without her knowing of course, and every loud, sudden noise made him tense up, hand going for his wand. He told himself that such a response was only human, but he felt as if he shouldn't exactly be susceptible to common human failings, such as anxiety and, well, there was no other word for it, fear.

He knew that it was wise to fear the Dark Lord, and that if he hadn't been feeling some sort of concern or heightened tension, something was decidedly wrong with him. Still, he felt that if this had happened last year, before he got used to talking about things with other people, and before certain Gryffindorish traits rubbed off on him, he would have handled this better. He had changed ever since he had befriended Bill, and right now, he was wondering if that was a bad thing.

He sighed and rubbed his eyes, wondering if he should send for another pot of coffee, or if he should try to take a shower to wake him up. He decided on the coffee.

He was in the Common Room so all he had to do was put a coffee mug on the table and it would disappear to the kitchens, only to come back filled and with a platter full of biscuits, which was one of the best parts about being Head Boy. He ignored the snacks and merely sipped at the coffee, waiting for it to cool while he studied the language sheets in front of him.

He had figured out the verb conjugations for the third but he was having some difficulties with the – oh. He must really be tired to miss that. Draco picked up his quill and scribbled down a few notes and then pulled out another clean sheet of parchment and wrote out the rules to the third dialect.

One more to go.

He immediately started on the second, and last, dialect, knowing that he was close, but the anticipation and the strain of the week were catching up with him. By Friday morning, even though he had worked all night, he had only managed to muddle up the pronoun difference of the dialects which should have only taken him four hours tops. Now, he was worse off than when he started.

He went down to Potions early to tell Snape he would be skipping the session on the counter to Veritaserum that evening. He made sure his uniform completely immaculate in order to make up for his haggard appearance, but the Head of Slytherin wasn't even remotely fooled.

Snape had taken one look at him and had frowned.

"I won't be able to make this evening's session," said Draco, before the Potions Professor could say anything.

"Working on the runes?" asked Snape.

Draco nodded. "Almost there. Has the Dark Lord spoken of going after the cloak yet?"

"Not as of yet, but I doubt he would tell anyone who was not needed for the retrieval. He has been increasingly silent as of late, which is always a precursor to particularly large attacks."

Draco grimaced, knowing that Snape was right. He then stifled a yawn and had to blink rapidly to clear the clouds away from his vision.

"You've been working too hard," said Snape.

"I have to get the translations done."

"Or you could just go to the safe house."

Draco shook his head and the Potions Master sighed.

"You are in no condition to work with volatile substances. Not when you're half asleep already."

"I'm fine."

"We're working on a fusion potion today in class. You'll have to sit this class out."

"I'm fine," said Draco again.

"You've been up practically all week, don't think I haven't noticed. One wrong slip in this class and you'll destroy the classroom and most of your classmates with it."

"I'm not going to slip up," said Draco, stifling another yawn and blinking forcefully because his eyes were feeling dry and his vision was going again.

"I don't care how smart you are, not even a genius can fight off exhaustion. You will not be participating in the class work."

"I'll take a wakening potion."

"Only to have it hit you twice as hard when it wears off?"

Draco sighed. "Fine. I'll sit out. Happy?"

"No. I could use you making the potion to keep your classmates from blowing themselves up."

"Then let me make the potion," said Draco.

Snape hesitated and Draco raised an eyebrow. Snape slid his chair back.

"Come with me."

Draco followed Snape to the side door, the one that led to Snape's private office. Snape shut the door behind them and then crossed over to his desk.

Draco looked about the room while Snape rummaged through his desk drawers. There was a pleasant fire roaring in the grate, and a comfortable looking black sofa with a matching armchair. The desk was farther back with a great chair behind it.

Snape pulled out a vial and handed it to Draco.

"Take this," he said.

Draco took the vial, noting the red-orange color and then raising an eyebrow at Snape.

"A wakefulness inducer," he said.

"A wakefulness inducer won't make you crash as hard as the others. Just don't tell Dumbledore; he thinks you ought to be locked in your room until you've had a decent amount of sleep. I just don't want my class to end in exploding cauldrons."

Draco smirked and pulled the cap off. "I won't tell," he promised.

He downed the potion in one swallow because he knew that they tasted like something dead, but then he frowned, staring up at Snape as the distinct after-taste of raspberries filled his mouth.

"You lied," he managed.

Snape shrugged. "I never said it was a wakefulness inducer."

Draco tried to fight back the potion, but it was futile. He was barely holding back his exhaustion as it was and the sleep-aid made the world go fuzzy even as he stood there. The vial slipped from his fingers to shatter on the floor, and he would have followed, but then Snape was there, guiding his stumbling steps to the couch. Draco was aware that the couch was as comfortable as it looked, and then he was face down on the cushions and his eyes were closing.

He woke up when someone entered later that day and he groaned, blinking open his eyes to see Snape arching a brow in his direction.

"What time is it?" Draco asked, pushing himself into a sitting position and rubbing his eyes blearily.

"Almost three in the afternoon," said Snape. "Afternoon classes are about finished, and I figured you would like to continue working on your runes. I had you excused from your classes today as you were not feeling well. I trust you are feeling marginally better?"

"Yeah," said Draco, stretching and then standing up. He had to bite back a yawn as his body reminded him that seven-hour napping spree did not make up for a week's worth of missed REM. He looked up at Snape. "I suppose I should thank you, although next time I would just like the news that I'm excused from classes."

"If I just excused you from classes, you would have worked on your runes, which was not the point in letting you skive off."

"I'm never taking a potion you give me again without testing it first."

"If you had been thinking clearly, and more alert, you would have noticed the smell and thinness of the potion in the first place. Sleep deprivation does not benefit a Slytherin."

"Noted," said Draco. He nodded to the Potions Master and then left the room, heading back to his dorm and pulling out his translations and looking at them with fresh, alert eyes. The nap had helped and he started on the pronouns.

It was during dinner, a dinner that Draco was actually eating at, that Dumbledore came in late. It usually was nothing new, as not all of the teachers came down at the same time, but the expression on the Headmaster's face made Draco pause.

The blue eyes, that were not twinkling today, locked onto his and the minutest of head nods was gestured to the door. Then the Headmaster patted down his robes and frowned, as if he had forgotten something, and he left again.

Draco waited a few moments before excusing himself as well and walking out of the Great Hall. The Headmaster was waiting for him outside and he led Draco down a little-used hallway.

"Has the Dark Lord taken the cloak?" asked Draco.

"He has," Dumbledore confirmed.

"Today?" asked Draco.

Dumbledore sighed. "I'm afraid we don't know."

"What?" asked Draco.

"I thought it was taking Tom too long to make a move, so I had the Aurors examine the cloak. The one in the tomb was a fake, somehow Voldemort managed to switch the cloaks without alerting the Aurors and so the cloak they were guarding was merely a replica."

Draco stared and then turned away from the Headmaster, his fingers tapping out their pattern double-time. "Merde," he muttered. He turned back around. "The Dark Lord could attack at any time."

"He could."

"If he sent a Death Eater in with the cloak, he could set up a Floo connection to let the other Death Eaters in."

"I thought that would be his approach as well. We cannot ward the Floo in any way but we have set up a system of alarms to tell us what fireplaces are in use."

"Have you considered putting up barrier wards?"

"We have, and we have set some up, but it would merely stall the Death Eaters for a short amount of time. It isn't possible to put up any stronger barriers because of the wards already around the castle."

Draco nodded. "And you have briefed the teachers on the evacuation plan?"

"And I'll be informing a few Prefects as well after dinner."

"Will you be using the boats?"

"They will be in use, but when the attack comes, I want you to concentrate on getting yourself out, understood?"

"I will be getting Laney out," said Draco.

"I have instructed Minerva and the Gryffindor Prefects on the importance of getting Laney away from the Death Eaters, as she would be a target. She will get out."

"Excuse me if I'm not convinced," said Draco coolly.

"Did Bill talk to you?"

"Did he talk to you?"

"Not after the two of you conversed. I do hope that he conveyed to you your value to the Order, but also to the Death Eaters."

"He said something along those lines," said Draco.

"Just remember them, and also remember that we aren't just looking after you because of your incredibly sharp mind. We like Harry for more than his scar as well." The Headmaster's blue eyes twinkled at him.

"Of course," said Draco, fighting the urge to roll his eyes. "Is that all?" He really needed to get back to translating his runes.

"It is."

"Good evening then."

"And to you."

Draco nodded and then went straight up to the Common Room. He pulled out his runes and sat in his armchair. He needed this done now.

He had been working an hour when the door opened, admitting Hermione, Harry, and Blaise. Draco raised his eyebrow at the intrusion.

"Dumbledore told us about the cloak," said Hermione.

"And?" Draco asked.

Hermione shrugged. "We're going to go over the evacuation plans again. Dumbledore just told us. I understand that you won't be joining us in leading the evacuation."

"He thinks it's best if I concentrate on getting out as opposed to helping others," said Draco.

"Sounds like a good idea," said Hermione.

Draco made a noncommittal noise and then returned to his runes. The trio sat on the couch, conversing quietly. Draco followed as he translated.

"The boats are a good idea. I'm only worried about the open area leading to the dock area," said Harry. "It would be easy just to pick the students off from the castle windows."

"We'll just have to be fast," said Hermione. "Make sure there's no one there to get hit by the Death Eaters."

"There will be stragglers, though," said Harry. "We should post a guard on the halls that overlook the landing platform so that the Death Eaters won't have access to the windows."

"And how would we get that person out of the castle?"

"I could do it," said Blaise. "I could jump out of the window."

"It's three stories up."

"I have limited flight capabilities," said Blaise.

"What?" asked Hermione.

"Haven't you been paying attention to the gossip?" asked Blaise. "My grandmother was part fey."

"Part what?" asked Harry.

"Fey," said Draco, looking up from his papers. "A magical creature that lives deep within magical forests. They look somewhat like humans, but have sharp teeth, claws, and can glide on the wind. They're the only natural enemy to vampires and are thought to be some sort of evolved strain of vampire, one that didn't survive on blood. The Muggles got the rumors of vampires turning into bats because of the fey's ability to glide."

"Thank you, Mr. Textbook. Could you make it sound any duller?" asked Blaise. "My great-grandmother was fey. On rare occasions the genes are passed on, though they won't become apparent for a few generations. See?"

He opened his mouth and his teeth shifted, growing longer and pointed.

"Wicked," said Harry.

"It also means he isn't as susceptible to dark curses," said Draco. "He'd make a good guard."

"Would the fey genes really affect you so much, even though you're so far removed from your great-grandmother?" asked Hermione.

"Well, that's the cool thing about being fey," said Blaise. "The genes will always remain just as strong, which means that if I ever have kids, and if they have the right genes, they'll have all the abilities I do, and I have all the abilities my great-grandmother has. The only thing that is different between a full-blooded fey and a descendant of a fey is that I can choose when to use certain features of the fey, such as I can choose when to grow fangs and such."

"Sounds convenient," said Hermione.

"It is. It keeps the other Slytherins off of me, especially as their curses don't do much to me and I can just grow fangs and they go all pale." Blaise grinned; he obviously enjoyed tormenting the boys in his dorm.

Draco smirked at the image of Blaise snarling at Theodore Nott and the burly Slytherin scrambling backwards to get out of the fey's way. He would like to see that.

By Saturday morning, Draco was well on his way to having the Persian Runes translated, but still, the idea that a Death Eater could simply appear in Hogwarts was a worrisome thought, and so, although he did take a quick nap – because he found himself making stupid mistakes – and although he did take a break to eat, he was secluded in the Common Room for most of the day.

The entire mood of the castle was tensed as well. The teachers had been informed about the threat, as well as the Prefects, though, not the Slytherin ones. Blaise and Snape would be leading that group to safety as the older Slytherin students would only be helping the Death Eaters had they been given information of the escape plans.

The older students seemed to pick up on the unspoken tension. They were quieter, and studied in the dorm rooms, looking at the grim faces of the professors and student leaders with confusion and worry. The younger students seemed to notice it as well, but they were less affected, especially as the older students were always worried about school work and grades anyway.

Draco had taken to posting the pages on the walls of the Common Room, a technique that helped him study a broader range of runes at one time. By lunch time he had found the variations of all the nouns and adjectives. By the afternoon, he had finished the second Persian Dialect, almost by accident. He had been taking a quick step back from the verbs, trying to figure out how they all fit together, when he had thought it looked surprisingly like the fifth dialect, and that was when he realized that's all it was. The verbs had translated back to the first dialect.

He nearly laughed at the simplicity, allowing a grin to slide onto his face.

"What's the good news?" asked Hermione from the couch where she was writing a Charms essay.

"I did it," said Draco, still not quite believing it himself.

"Wait, you translated the code about the Veil?" asked Hermione.

"Not yet. I still have to work the code, but I translated the language the chapter uses." He immediately ran to his bookshelf and pulled down the chapters of The Averne. "Now all I have to do is decipher the rest of the code."

He flipped through the chapters, memorizing the titles and immediately picking out how each chapter contributed to the code. He read the last chapter, mulling over the words in his brain.

It was then that the alarm sounded, the same alarm that had signaled the breaking of the warded doors in the dungeons the last year. Draco felt his blood run cold; it was too soon.

"That's the Death Eaters," said Hermione, her face going pale.

She closed her eyes for a moment, and took in a shaky breath, steeling herself. When she opened her eyes, she appeared calm, although there was a fierce determination behind the brown orbs.

"Dumbledore wants you to get out," she told him, and then she was out the door.

Draco ran up to his room, knowing that the alarm had rung because Death Eaters were using the Floo. He also knew that there were barriers that would hold the Death Eaters up for a few moments and so he could take the time to grab his unregistered wand. It was always a good idea to have a back up.

His extra wand was in his wardrobe, and he also grabbed his worn, green Muggle jacket and a black-knit cap. He didn't want to be recognizable, not when he was going to be getting Laney the hell out of the castle.

He was out of the Head Room not thirty seconds after Hermione, jacket and cap on, running as fast as he could to the Gryffindor Tower. There was a slight hold up on the stairs leading to the Gryffindor rooms; a dark ghoul was whizzing about the stairs, snarling and lunging at the Prefects who were trying to get up to help the students down.

"Bloody hell!" Draco swore, shoving his way up through the crowd. The Death Eaters had gone for the internal wards again in order to wreck havoc on any evacuation plan Dumbledore had instated.

Up above on the landing he could see Harry standing protectively in front of the students, wand drawn out, trying to decide if it was safer to blast the creature or merely make a run for it

Draco started up the stairs, drawing the ghoul's attention. The ghoul whizzed down and Draco sent off a spell, realized it would miss a split second later, and flicked his wand a second time. The second curse hit; the ghoul shrieked and flamed up.

Draco ran up the last few stairs and grabbed Harry's arm, pulling him to the side of the stairs while the students rushed passed them. "Where's Laney?" he demanded.

Harry shook his head. "She went to the library a little while ago and she hasn't come back yet."

"Shit," Draco swore, and then he turned, intent on running to the library, but Harry grabbed his arm.

"McGonagall's in charge of getting the kids out of the library. Laney will be fine."

"And what if she wasn't in the library?" he demanded. "What if she was in the hall on her way back here?"

"You can't just run around the school! Not when the Death Eaters are looking specifically for you."

"I'd like to see you stop me," said Draco, jerking away from Harry and then shoving his way through the stairs jammed full of students. He made it to the empty hall way, but footsteps pounding after him made him turned around.

"I'm coming with you," said Harry.

"Hero complex much?"

"Right back at you."

They were halfway to the library, checking the rooms on the way and yelling out 'Laney!' as loudly as they dared, when they met with the first Death Eater, both parties rounding the corner at the same time. Harry pulled up short, the Death Eater froze, and Draco blasted him backwards with a curse. The Death Eater crumpled.

"Nice," said Harry.

"Thanks."

"Uncle Draco!"

They both whipped around to see Laney running out from a classroom. She ran straight to Draco, half-sobbing at the fright and Draco was grabbing her tight, taking half a second to reassure himself that she was alright.

"I was in the library," said Laney, "but then the men in the masks came and they started taking people. Ron and McGonagall attacked the Death Eaters so that we could fly out the window, but I was closer to the door and so I ran away when they weren't looking."

"Taking people?" asked Draco. "Actually taking them somewhere?"

"After they stunned them," said Laney.

Draco looked up to see Harry glancing towards the library, his green eyes worried, and then Harry's eyes locked on his.

"Go," said Draco. "I can get Laney out, you see about McGonagall and Weasley."

"Be careful," said Harry.

"Back at you," said Draco.

And then Harry took off down the hall.

"Come on," said Draco, taking Laney's hand. "Let's get out of here, yeah?"

Laney nodded, and the two started back towards the boat entrance at a run. They never made it.

The Death Eaters had discovered the evacuation, and a contingent of eight had been deployed to stop the escape. Four were attacking the landing from the windows that over looked the lake from the upper floors, two were out on the landing dock attacking the remaining students directly, and two more were guarding the exit, making sure that no more children left the school.

Draco turned to Laney, both of them hidden behind the corner.

"Stay here, alright?" he asked.

"Where are you going?" The question was just on the edge of panic.

"I'm just going around the corner to get rid of the bad men. Remember Diagon Alley? I'm just going to stop the bad men, and then we can get out of here, alright? When I call your name, I want you to follow me outside, okay?"

Laney nodded, but her eyes were wide and mouth pressed together, trying not to cry. Draco gave her a reassuring smile and then he stepped out into the hall.

The Death Eaters were startled, but they were good, immediately sending hexes his way. Draco's stride didn't even pause as he blocked the two curses, sending out two more. One hit the Death Eater on the left, but the one on the right blocked it. He was down half a second later, not even noticing the second curse Draco had sent.

"Laney!" He half turned to see his niece running out. "Just stay right beside me."

And then they were out on the edge of the long marble patio that made up the landing dock. The far side jutted out, shallow marble steps leading down to where the dark water lapped up against the stone. There was a line of boats faithfully gliding across the water to skim by the steps so the students could get in, and then the boat would turn and float away while the next craft pulled up. At least, that's what was supposed to be happening, but the boats were being capsized and crushed by curses from the Death Eaters once the small ships were in range.

The boats were warded against dark curses and also warded to keep the students from falling out, but the Death Eaters were using water curses, causing the lake to rise up and over turn the boats, and so the few students that remained could not get off the dock. The two Death Eaters that were attacking the students were stunning the younger children and then levitating their bodies away from the edge. They were then dropping a Portkey coin on the unconscious students and the children would disappear.

Blaise Zabini and Ginny Weasley were doing their best to protect the remaining students huddled at the bottom of the steps, but Draco could see that Blaise was injured, a stream of blood running down the side of his face and he had his hands full trying to keep the unconscious form of Hermione Granger from being called over to the Death Eaters. Ginny was trying to keep him conscious enough to save Hermione while standing in front of six students and blocking stunning hexes.

Draco spotted the two attacking Death Eaters, hiding behind the pillars that held up the slight over hang before they spotted him. He cut them both down, yelling out 'Decido!' The yell was partly because he wanted it powerful enough to take both of them out with one curse and partly so that Ginny and Blaise would see him.

They did.

"Draco!" Blaise yelled, suddenly looking more alert at the sight of his friend that was supposed to have left at the beginning of the attack.

"Run over on my mark!" Ginny shouted over to him. "We'll cover you!"

Draco was hoping they would be able to provide them cover; he didn't think he could get Laney across ten meters of open marble while there were Death Eaters attacking from above. He grabbed Laney's hand, prepared to run.

Ginny and Blaise sent out a flurry of hexes at the windows of the castle.

"Now!" Ginny yelled.

Draco took off, pulling Laney along with him, perhaps going a little fast for the girl, but his firm grip propelled her along as well.

The curses Blaise and Ginny were yelling were primarily the 'protego' shield charm, but because the Death Eaters were using dark magic, the shields only held for a few seconds at most. Still, Draco and Laney made it to the edge of the steps without harm, and once they were there, Draco whirled around, yelling 'Contego!'

A blue shimmering light burst out of his wand and then spread out in a thin wall of the iridescent light. This time, when the dark curses were called out, they were merely absorbed by the shield. Draco turned to Blaise and Ginny.

"I can't hold that for long."

"I should say not," said Blaise. "That's a dark curse for a reason."

Draco knew that, and he knew that holding a dark shield only drained the caster. Wizards had died from holding the shield for too long, and that was why it was a dark curse. Draco didn't see why. During the war, often times a general or a commander would cast and hold the shield during a retreat so his men could get to safety. Such people were considered heroes, sacrificing their life for others and it was only after the wars that the curse was put under the category of dark.

The shield also made it hard for the Death Eaters to hit the arriving boats, and Ginny packed three of the students in the first boat that came by.

Draco knelt by Hermione and checked her pulse. The Head Girl was merely unconscious due to a rather powerful variation of the stunning spell and so he woke her up with an 'ennervate', that wouldn't completely pulling her back into reality, but should at least make her able to respond to her surroundings.

Hermione groaned and her eyes fluttered open.

"Granger, you awake?" Draco asked.

"Sort of," Hermione managed, rubbing a hand at her eyes.

"We're going to get you out of here. The boats, remember?" asked Draco.

"Yeah."

Draco looked up to see the last of the students sent off, and another empty boat coming forward.

"Laney," he said, "you're going to go with Hermione, alright?"

He would have liked to send Laney with Ginny, because the Gryffindor girl looked the most alert, but he knew that head injuries such as Blaise's could be serious and Ginny would have to keep the Slytherin awake.

"I want to go with you though," said Laney.

"I know, but I need you to look after Hermione. Can you do that for me?"

Laney glanced at the Head Girl who was staring up at the sky and nodded.

"Good girl," said Draco. The empty boat came closer and Draco pulled Hermione up and helped her down the steps. Ginny was holding onto Laney's hand, and once Hermione had managed to get in the boat, Ginny helped Laney in as well.

Laney waved good-bye and Draco returned the gesture. A few dark curses hit the shield and Draco pulled off his cap and dropped it on the ground, rubbing at the back of his head and trying to push back the pain the curses caused. He turned to Ginny.

"How do you feel about using dark magic?" he asked.

"Sometimes it's a necessary evil," the girl responded. "Why?"

"I can't hold the shield for much longer and then the Death Eaters are going to start attacking again with their wind and water curses to try to capsize the boats. The counter is 'consido', and it's just a simple wave of the wand. I want you to make sure that Laney gets to Hogsmeade without drowning."

"I think you should just take the next boat," said Ginny. "You're supposed to get out of here."

"But when I leave the shield does to. I can hold it for a bit longer and it's best if you just leave now."

"You're not going to try and do anything stupid, are you? You wouldn't decide to get captured by Tom just for some crazy plan, would you?"

"The thought crossed my mind," said Draco, "but things didn't exactly work out. I'm taking a boat out of here." He couldn't pull off his plan because he still didn't know the artifacts needed for the ritual, which meant he could alert the Aurors. He didn't particularly relish the idea of being a prisoner of the Dark Lord without a back up plan.

"I'm holding you to that," said Ginny. Draco smirked, remember Bill saying the exact same thing.

The next boat drew closer and Draco crossed over to Blaise who was leaning against the low railing of the steps.

"How's your head?" he asked. Normally he would heal the wound, but with the shield cast, he didn't have the energy spare.

"I'm good," said Blaise, but his eyes weren't exactly focused.

"What happened?"

"I was taking out some Death Eaters on the third floor, but then one took me out."

"The news about a fey traveled rather fast," said Ginny. "So a whole bunch of Death Eaters were sent up. We managed to get over half the students out on the boats because Blaise was guarding the windows, but then he got thrown out of one."

"I thought feys could fly," said Draco.

"Yeah, I just forgot until the last minute. It's one of the abilities I don't get to practice a whole lot."

"We'll have to work on that then," said Draco.

The empty boat pulled up and Draco helped Blaise down the steps and into the small crafts. He was going to offer a hand to Ginny as well, but the girl made boarding a boat in motion look surprisingly easy without any assistance at all.

"Remember," said Draco, "the spell is-,"

"Consido," said Ginny. "With a regular wave of the wand. I'm a fast learner." She frowned. "That sounded completely cliché."

Draco smirked and watched the boat pull away, the next empty boat floating forwards. He had just thought that they had managed to pull this thing off rather well when Ginny screamed.

"Draco!"

He jerked his eyes up to see her pointing behind him, trying to warn him. There was no time to whip around and her terrified gaze locked onto his, and then there was an explosion of pain in the back of his head as several dark curses were hurled against his shield at the exact same moment.

He could hear the shield fizzle out behind him even as the force of the curses on his shield shoved him forward, right into the cold, black waters. It actually turned out to be a good thing because the freezing water shocked his system back into awareness.

He forced back the urge to suck in a breath at the cold and waited for what felt like half an eternity before he swam to the surface, coming out into the open air with no warning. He was calling out curses the instant his eyes locked onto the Death Eaters standing on the steps, looking for his body.

He managed to topple the closest Death Eaters and then he pulled himself up onto the steps, taking down two more Death Eaters, but more were coming, pouring out of the school. Draco looked back only to see the empty boat coming for him to be flipped over by a water curse before it was broken into bits. He wouldn't be getting out this way.

He charged up the stairs, not wanting the Death Eaters to have the high ground. If he was going to be taken by the Dark Lord, he was going to do everything in his power to take out as many Death Eaters as he could right now. It made the chances for escape marginally better.

Had he been working on full capacity, he would have held out longer, but he was drained from the shield spell and he was beginning to shiver from the frigid water. He blocked as many spells as he could, and sent out twice as much, taking four down and injuring two more before a curse caught him on his side and he went sprawling, toppling back down the stairs, hitting his temple painfully on the marble before he came to a rest two steps from the water.

Draco could see the boat holding Ginny and Blaise gradually grow smaller even as the two were calling out his name, trying to get to him, but the wards that prevent the students from falling out of the boat also prevented them from throwing themselves into the water as well.

He forced himself to his feet, his wand still clenched in his hand. Warm liquid trickled down his forehead and he knew without reaching up that it was blood.

"Reicio antepalini."

The first line of Death Eaters were thrown back, but he didn't even notice the responding curse, not until it hit his chest, a stunner. Darkness rose up, claiming him just like the black waters that once again received his form. This time, though, he hardly felt the cold as he slipped under.

Ron had been put in charge of guarding the students at the library should there be a Death Eater attack. Yeah, as if it were even possible.

You would think that Dumbledore would realize that there was only one entrance to the library and that perhaps he should just close down the library until after the attack so that students weren't trapped. Better yet, how about Dumbledore just closed classes as well as the library. Ron liked that idea, but Dumbledore didn't seem to be impressed by his reasoning.

Still, Ron did the best he could; he wasn't a junior chess champion for nothing. He had brought in the brooms that the school kept in the Quidditch shack and hidden them behind the bookshelves by the windows. McGonagall disapproved of the idea of brooms in the library, but she couldn't say anything because if Death Eaters did happen by the library, it was either fly or jump.

He had also discovered that the wards on the bookshelves in the restricted section did more than scream when a student took a book, but they also deflected spells. Ron didn't know how well the wards would hold up to dark curses, but it was better than nothing.

It was because of this that when the alarm went off, Ron, who had been camping out at the library, was able to get five students out on brooms before the Death Eaters stormed in, which they did almost immediately.

Ron gathered the rest of the students behind the restricted shelves and then had them run to the brooms and out the window one at a time while he and McGonagall provided as much cover as they could against nine Death Eaters. Some made it; some didn't. Those who didn't were stunned by the Death Eaters who then called the bodies over, only to Portkey them who knows where.

It was during the attack that he noticed Laney Chalmers-Malfoy hiding under a desk. He hadn't even seen the small girl come in, but he knew that if they got the chance, the Death Eaters would love to get their hands on the illegitimate grand-daughter of Lucius Malfoy. Ron liked the kid, even though he hated her uncle with a passion, but still, he knew that no one could choose the family they were born into. Just look at his family after all. They received the scorn of most Purebloods and a few times they had even been shunned by Half-bloods and Muggle-borns who seemed to think that all Purebloods were prejudice and that the Weasley family just hid it well, or helped the others out of pity.

Ron wanted to get the girl out, and she needed a distraction and so Ron turned to the four students behind the shelf with him.

"I'm going out, and when I do, run for the window, alright?"

And then Ron had charged out behind the shelf, running directly at the masked followers of Voldemort with a battle roar, flinging curses as fast as he could think of them and pushing them away from the door. He hoped Laney would realize that was a cue to run, and he could see the girl slip out the door. Good.

He was hit by a stunner and was out in an instant.

He woke to a hand shaking him gently and he pried open his eyes to stare at the concerned face of Professor McGonagall. His eyes slid to the right where he could see a wall made up of steel bars. That couldn't be good.

He sat up, taking in the large prison they were held in. It was made up of three walls of bars, the fourth being the stone walls that made up the larger room the cell was held in. To the left was a stone staircase leading up to a door and the rest of the room was empty, save a table and chairs. Two Death Eaters sat there playing a game of cards, their faces uncovered, but Ron didn't recognize any of them.

Besides himself and McGonagall, there were nine other people in the cell, all of them students from Hogwarts and all of them fourth year or younger. Three were Gryffindor, four Hufflepuff and two Ravenclaws. No Slytherins, but that wasn't a surprise to Ron. The students were huddling together, some sniffing quietly, the older ones trying to comfort the younger.

"What do you suppose they want?" he asked McGonagall softly.

The Professor shook her head. "I don't know."

The door at the top of the stairs banged open and three more Death Eaters appeared, one levitating a body between them. Another one captured.

Ron reached for his wand, already knowing it wasn't there, but he stood when the Death Eaters drew closer, standing in front of the other students. McGonagall stood as well.

The door of the prison was opened with a spell and then the body was dumped inside, the figure rolling a few times before coming to rest on his back, his face turned towards the occupants of the cell.

"The hell?" Ron managed, stepping back from the unconscious form of Draco Malfoy who was dressed in the school trousers and button-up shirt but also the most Muggle-looking, most ugly green jacket Ron had ever seen. He also had blood smearing the side of his head. Was this some sort of trick in hopes to get him or McGonagall to trust the Slytherin who would then tell their secrets to the Dark Lord?

Ron was not going to fall for it.

My longest chapter in this story yet! Are you wondering how Draco's going to pull this off? If so, leave a review. If not...umm, well, I don't know. I suppose you wouldn't have to then.

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would abandon my college classes and play in the warm weather and sunshine!

AUTHOR'S NOTE: One of my amazing reviewers, Maya Snape, has made a cover pic for The Code, and you can see it at

http albums/a87/terraesan/ Harry20Potter/thecode. jpg

Just copy the address over and remove the spaces that I had to include because ff doesn't like hyperlinks and what not. Anyway, it is an awesome picture, and I love it, and whenever I get writers block I go look at it to be inspired. So check it out!

Kiki: Well, if you haven't gone crazy with anticipation yet, here's the next chapter…

Anna: I love strawberry jam, but you're right, Draco is in a lot more trouble than that. Thanks for the review!

Sabireru: You're right, Draco could use his animagi form, especially seeing as I finally found one for him, but that's in the next chapter…

Drewberry: I'm afraid that the next couple of chapters may all be slightly cliff-hangerish, just because, well, Draco is captured by Death Eaters and all.

Freyalyn: Yeah, was a pretty bad cliff-hanger, but see, it wasn't really intentional, it just sorta ended that way. And yes, it probably does need a 'd'. I do try to catch all my typos, but there are just so many (sigh).

Sanjs: two hundred bucks on poker? Nice. Was it Texas hold 'em, that's my fav, but I suck. Anyway, I'm glad I could contribute to your awesome day. Thanks for the review!

FaithMaguire: Glad you could stay conscious long enough to read my chapter, and hope you're a little more alert today. Thanks for reviewing.

Conngirl89: Yes, Draco has changed, but he still has some Ice Prince left in him, which I think I will annunciate in the third story…getting ahead of myself, lol. As for Harry, he's okay. I'll touch on that next chapter I think. Thanks for reviewing!

Gremlin: lol, I'm glad I bring joy to Tuesdays. And I love happy dances!

In the first instant that Draco awoke, he knew exactly what happened and what must have happened. It was something he had always been able to do.

Because he knew that he had been stunned by Death Eaters, and because he knew he must have been taken to the Death Eater stronghold, he repressed the urge to stir and open his eyes, and forced his breathing to remain calm and steady as he took stock of his condition.

He was dry, and he distinctly remembered taking a plunge or two into the lake, so one of the Death Eaters must have cast a drying charm on him, no doubt because the Dark Lord couldn't afford his translator to catch a cold. The area above his right temple was throbbing where he had hit it on the steps, and because it was just beginning to itch, it must have started to scab over. He couldn't feel his other wand in his pocket, which meant that they had searched him and found it. He hoped they wouldn't snap either of them.

He could hear voices around him, and identified them as Professor McGonagall, Ron Weasley, and a few other whispers, which meant that other students had been taken as well. He couldn't quite identify those voices, which meant they were younger students, no older than fourth year, and from the voices he figured there were around six of them.

Someone knocked against something and there was the clear ring of steel, which meant that they were in a cell of some sort and the smell of the air was scarily familiar, but to know for sure, he would have to open his eyes.

He stirred, and immediately the voices fell silent. He moaned, made a show of his eyelids fluttering, as if he was trying to force himself into consciousness and then finally succeeding, and stared up at the ceiling before pushing himself into a sitting position.

His hand rose to his head and he winced, and that wasn't an act. His head was aching and his vision somewhat blurred, but he blinked it away. Perhaps a slight concussion, nothing more.

There were seven other kids as well as the Professor and Ronald Weasley and the jail cell they were all currently locked in was nothing other that the Malfoy Estate's dungeons kept below the wine cellar. The irony was not lost on Draco.

He turned his head to see two Death Eaters at the table outside the cell and identified them as Broxton and Callahan. He then pushed himself to his feet and stretched, making sure he wasn't injured anywhere else, before surveying the other prisoners.

Ron appeared to be unharmed as well as McGonagall. That was good. The other students looked too young to be of any real use, although there was a fourth year, a Ravenclaw, and he looked as if he might be able to at least keep on eye on the students.

Still, the presence of the others created an opportunity. Perhaps he would still be able to warn the Aurors. He walked over to a wall of bars and sat down. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes. He needed to think.

He called up the pages of The Averne in his mind, or more specifically, the pages that held the chapter titles. The titles held the code that referenced the veil, and he could still figure out the rest of the code, if he had enough time of course.

It was hard to concentrate, knowing that a cell full of eyes were watching him, wondering if he had anything to do with the attack, wondering if he was going to do anything that would make it worse for them.

He pulled up his mental shields, just because it always helped him pull away from his environment and focus. It wasn't exactly easy trying to translate a code in his head, but still, it was only a few words. He should be able to manage.

It took him roughly half an hour to find the next words: Payment of the Crossing.

Draco puzzled over that in his mind. The code now read: The Descent/ Submersion an easy path. No doors bar the road, but Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life is not easily returned/retraced. The Road not by water, so diverged by men. A Mantle/Veil of water woven to mark the way. Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life may be saved, but only with a prayer, an offering, and the Payment of the Crossing.

He immediately knew what it must be. The offering was simply a letting of blood, not a lot, just enough to fill a goblet. The payment would be a coin. The whole Veil was based on the mythology of the Underworld, and according to the stories, a coin was needed to pay Charon to ferry the soul across the River Acheron. In this case, though, the soul would be taken the other way.

He suddenly opened his eyes, sitting up straight as a thought hit him. He had always thought that if the Dark Lord called out his Horcrux, than he would have to call out Sirius Black because Black had been holding his Horcrux when he fell through, but that wouldn't be the case. The Horcrux was part of a soul after all; it would have to be called out separately.

He resisted the urge to smirk in triumph, after all, he was still a prisoner of the Dark Lord, although, if everything went right, he could remedy that as well.

He leaned his head back against the bars again, but didn't close his eyes. All the time he had been thinking he could feel the other students' eyes on him and the feeling was disconcerting. With his eyes open, they didn't dare look at him.

That, however, didn't stop McGonagall or Weasley from glancing suspiciously in his direction, so he merely glared at them and then pulled his knees up to his chest and settled back.

Silence.

Weasley took a seat as well, cross-legged and across the cell from Draco.

Silence.

One of the younger students lay against another.

Silence.

Draco felt boredom slipping in. He knew it was an odd feeling to have, especially in light of his current position, but he couldn't help it. He wanted something to happen so he could work through the events to turn the circumstances in his favor. Sitting here, in a cell full of young students and the Gryffindor Head of House, was incredibly monotonous. He let his fingers tap out his pattern for the lack of anything better to do.

Silence.

"I'm scared."

That was the young girl leaning against the fourth year.

Silence.

"Me too." That was a young boy.

"I want to go home."

"I want my mum."

"I'm starving."

"I'm scared."

"I'm bored," said Draco, finally giving into temptation and slouching against the bars.

"You're what?" asked Weasley, incredulous.

"Bored. Uninterested. Restless. Irked. Tiring of sitting here. Weary of listening to little kids whine. Done with being stuck here with nothing to do."

"Of course you're bored," said Ron. "You just have to sit here and listen to our conversations, right? And then afterwards, Daddy's going to come down and get you out of here once you're done spying on us."

Frightened eyes turned to Draco, who rolled his.

"Yes, because the knowledge that a bunch of little kids want their mothers is something the Dark Lord will want to know," he said, sarcasm dripping from his words.

"Piss off, Malfoy," said Ron.

Draco rolled his eyes again and the room lapsed into silence once more.

The door at the top of the stairs opened and three Death Eaters came through, walking down the stairs, their boots echoing chillingly through the room. The younger students huddled further back; McGonagall and Ron stood in front of them.

Draco didn't bother getting up; he knew what the Death Eaters were there for. They were there for him.

The Death Eaters stopped in front of the cell and unlocked the door. It swung open and one stepped through.

"You," he said, pointing at Draco. "Come."

Draco got to his feet, making sure that his mask of indifference was on his face.

"And you," said the Death Eater, pointing at Ron Weasley.

Whatever this was, it couldn't be good.

Draco walked out of the cell on his own power, not wanting to waste his energy on resisting, besides, resistance only led to punishment, and punishment meant injury. Draco couldn't afford that right now.

Ron did not have Draco's insight, and he was a Gryffindor, which meant that he was dragged out of the cell, yelling and fighting the entire way until a particularly nasty backhand stunned him so that the Death Eaters could get him up the stairs. Draco was merely prodded forward by wand tip, to which he glared, and then followed the rest out of the dungeons.

It was his house and so when they took a right once they reached the ground floor, he knew that they were going to the large study that Lucius often held business meetings in.

Sure enough, they walked down the ornately decorated hall and then entered through the two heavy, polished mahogany doors. The study held a fireplace on one side with two large armchairs, and large bookshelves. The other side held a large table with comfortable chairs set around it.

There were windows in the study, but the drapes were drawn, meaning it was night, and the room was lit with torches that lined the walls. There was a figure sitting in one of the chairs by the fire, and Draco knew, even before the figure stood, that it was the Dark Lord.

The Death Eaters stepped back respectfully, Ron being released with a shove. The red-head looked nervous, swallowing loudly but facing the chair defiantly. Draco merely stood there, waiting for the Dark Lord to make the first move.

Voldemort turned to face them, his eyes glinting red as he surveyed the two. His gaze finally rested on Draco. Draco refused to let his expression change and although he met the Dark Lord's gaze, his eyes were merely guarded, not openly defiant or repulsed. He knew the unresponsiveness would anger Voldemort more than rebellion.

"Other men in your position have wept," said Voldemort, his voice one of equal indifference as Draco's expression. "Others have begged and a few have soiled themselves. It would be a disappointment if you did such things. Do you know why it would be a disappointment?"

He stepped closer, but Draco didn't answer.

"It would be a disappointment because then it would mean that not only had I chosen a traitor to be my heir, but also a coward. So yes, it is a great relief that you do not cry and you do not plead."

Voldemort reached out with his pale hand and his fingers brushed Draco's cheek. Draco flinched; he couldn't help it. The Dark Lord smiled triumphantly at him, tracing his sharp nails lightly over Draco's face like the caress of a knife.

"Such defiance," said Voldemort, almost fondly. "So proud, so…afraid. Yes, you are afraid. Only a fool would not be, and you are no fool, are you?"

Draco remained silent and Voldemort backhanded him sharply, throwing his head to the side.

"You will answer your lord! Are you a fool, or are you not?"

"I am not," said Draco.

"But you are," said Voldemort. "I offered you my kingdom, my reign, my blessing. Would a fool refuse me?"

"A fool would accept you, a wise man as well. Only the very wise would refuse."

"Only the very wise," laughed the Dark Lord. His expression grew serious and he grabbed a fistful of Draco's hair, forcing him to his knees and then twisting his fingers in the strands, making sure Draco couldn't pull away. "Does a wise man count his life forfeit?" He yanked backwards, tilting Draco's face up to his. "Is death a wise choice? Is a life of pain and torment the life a shrewd man would choose?"

"The fool will never understand the choice of a wise man."

The Dark Lord forced Draco's head back even further, his muscles straining under such a position and the grip on his hair painful.

"I will tell you this," hiss Voldemort, his breath hot and putrid against Draco's face. "It is not wise to incite my wrath."

The Dark Lord looked up at his followers. "Tie the boy to the chair and gag him."

Draco could see, out of the corner of his eye, the Death Eaters grabbing Ron Weasley and forcing him over to a chair at the table, and then a Death Eater was blocking his view, but the yells and curses were muffled and then fell silent.

The Dark Lord released Draco with a shove and Draco fell to the floor, but pushed himself back up again. Voldemort paced over to the fire, staring into the flames.

"You are not wise," said Voldemort. "A wise man has lived long years, something that you will never experience, not unless you make a wise decision right now." He turned to Draco once more. "I do not extend welcome into my service twice, but should you consent to assisting me willingly, if you swear to serve me for the rest of your days and never stray from my side, I will be lenient. You will have the opportunity to be one of my followers again and through time, and through your deeds, you can reclaim the place of my most favored. What say you, Dragon?"

Draco was a genius, and he knew that antagonizing the Dark Lord was not a smart thing to do, but he was, above all, a teenaged boy, and so he smirked.

"I'd say you were pretty desperate for help if you're extending another invite. What's the matter? Is recruiting not what it used to be?"

The glare sent his way was deadly and then Draco was grabbed from behind and forced forward. He was dragged over and slammed into the chair at the foot of the table. Ron was to his right and looking completely confused.

"This is your last chance," said Voldemort, coming up behind him. "You will serve me, whether it be willingly or not. So what is your choice?"

"I'm not going to help you shed the blood of innocents, or try to purify the wizarding race. If I was for blood purity, I'd get rid of the Half-bloods first. You'd be among the first to go."

There was no retaliation, even though Draco braced himself for a 'crucio'. Instead, the Dark Lord laughed, walking around until he could see Draco.

"You don't wish to shed the blood of innocents? We will see how truly you believe that. Draco, how smart are you?"

Draco froze, knowing what Voldemort wanted him to do. He wanted Draco to reveal his secrets in front of Ron Weasley, a boy that he did not get along with. The Dark Lord knew that Draco didn't want to join the Order, and that he didn't trust most of them, and now he would be laying his secrets open before them.

"Crucio!" roared Voldemort.

Ron jerked, a muffled scream coming out of the gag, and then he was biting down, trying not to yell at the pain even as his body jerked and writhed, straining against the bonds.

Voldemort cut the curse off and Ron was left lying limp against the ropes, sweat dripping down his face even though he was shivering. He turned tortured blue eyes in Draco's direction.

Draco swallowed. "I'm smart," he said.

"Not good enough," said Voldemort. "Crucio!"

Again, the muffled cry and the grunts, gasping breaths through the nose as Ron tried to bite back the screams.

"Enough!" said Draco. "I'm a genius."

He couldn't take the sight of the red-head being tortured in front of him, not when the red-head was a brother to Bill. The curse ended and Ron stared at Draco in incomprehension. Draco looked away.

"A genius?" asked the Dark Lord. "Is it true that you translated the Persian Runes?"

Shit. Draco had been hoping he would be able to play the 'this is really hard even for a genius' card when he was translating to buy himself some time. It appeared Voldemort thought the same way.

"I translated them," he admitted.

"And you can translate the last of The Averne, and the code in it?"

"I can."

"And it will take you, how long?"

Draco shrugged. "A week, tops."

"Crucio!"

Ron jerked again.

"Five days!"

"Don't lie to me! I know you must have already started the translations."

"I'm not lying; I swear I'm not lying. I still have to translate from the third dialect, I only got that far. Maybe four days, but that's hoping that the grammatical structure of the third and second aren't changed from the fourth. If they are it will be five days and there is nothing I can do to make it go faster."

He stared at the Dark Lord, willing him to believe his lie. Next to him Ron still convulsed and screamed through the gag and Draco felt afraid. If the Dark Lord found out he was lying, he wouldn't hesitate to kill Ron, and Draco was not going to be the cause of the death of Bill's brother.

The curse ended and Draco could hear Ron gulping in air and he resisted the urge to do the same.

"You will have four days," said the Dark Lord.

Draco nodded, wanting to do nothing more than breathe a sigh of relief, but stopping himself. He glanced Ron's way to see the boy still trembling from the curse. Voldemort stepped closer to Draco and the door in the back of the room opened. The Dark Lord looked at the visitor and then turned back to Draco with a leering smile.

"Tell me, Draco, if you are a genius, why didn't you tell your father?"

And then Lucius Malfoy was there as well, looking at Draco with a detached, distant expression, and Draco, try as he might, could not read anything in that gaze. Draco stared at his father, not knowing what to say to him, but wanting to tell him something, something to let him know that he hadn't forsaken his family, just the Dark Lord, but the words were stuck in his throat.

"Draco, need I remind you what will happen if you do not answer?" asked the Dark Lord, looking at Ron meaningfully.

"I-," Draco started, not wanting Ron to be tortured any more, but at the same time not wanting to reveal his reasons in front of the Weasley, or anyone for that matter. He didn't even know if he could articulate his reasons. "I didn't because I…I didn't want to be a pawn, or for my genius to be used for reasons not my own."

He couldn't look at his father, and instead he stared at the table, feeling the prick behind his eyes but knowing tears would never fall. He had never been more grateful for that curse than he was right now.

"And did you or did you not have the opportunity to join me last year?"

"I did."

"And what did you say? Without the vulgarity, that is."

"I told you to screw yourself."

"And what was your reasoning?"

"I don't believe in your cause, or in the way you promote, or your leadership of such a cause. It's hypocritical, and your power is nothing more than fear."

"Those are some strong reasons. Tell me, Draco, and this is your very last chance, will you ever join me?"

"No," said Draco.

The Dark Lord grinned, a smile that only bespoke of horrors to come. "I was almost hoping you would say that." The door behind Draco opened again. "McNair, Nott, Wormtail, get him on the table."

Draco jumped to his feet as soon as his shoulder was grabbed and kicked back the chair. There was no way he wanted to get on that table. The chair hit the gut of whoever it was that had tried to grab him, and then he ducked under McNair's arm, but then Nott Sr. ran full tilt at him.

Draco tried to dart left, but he didn't have a chance. Nott's beefy arm grabbed him, hurling him backwards. Draco hit the table hard on his back and the breath was knocked out of him. He reflexively gasped and in the two seconds his body panicked for air, Nott grabbed his legs, McNair grabbed his right arm and Wormtail held down his left.

Once Draco managed to breathe again, he struggled, but he had no leverage and all men were much larger and stronger than he. That didn't stop him from trying, though he did fall quiet when Voldemort stepped into his line of vision. He held in his hands a long knife, sheathed in a cover of silver and gold. Voldemort drew the knife from the sheath and the sharp blade glinted in the firelight.

"You are outside of my mercy now, Draco, although if you beg it might go easier on you."

Draco laughed in the Dark Lord's face because it was so much more effective then swearing or cursing him. The Dark Lord's expression grew twisted.

"Wormtail," he said.

Wormtail grabbed Draco's hand and jerked his arm so that it was outstretched from his body, palm-side up. Draco's jacket and shirt sleeve were roughly pushed up, baring his forearm. Draco did not like where this was headed, and he tried to pull away, but his arm was being held by Wormtail's silver hand and the strength was frightening.

Voldemort paced behind the table and Draco couldn't follow the Dark Lord with his gaze, but he did manage to lock eyes with a horrified Ron Weasley.

"Because you refuse me, there will be no leniency on you, Draco. You will be marked as a traitor for the rest of your life, and even should you desire to bear my sign, you will never have that honor. All who meet you will know that you denied the Dark Lord and you will be despised."

The knife was brought down with terrifying accuracy and there was a blinding pain in his left arm. Draco couldn't stop the scream that left his throat and his body arched, no longer held down by the Death Eaters. His knees were bent, his feet flat on the table only to skid down as he clenched his teeth shut, biting off the scream and squeezing his eyes shut.

The pain didn't die down, but he pushed himself past the fire, forcing himself to take in a ragged breath and release it without a cry. He took in another, and another. He opened his eyes to stare at the ceiling while he bit back another scream and then he slowly, very slowly, turned his head to the left.

The knife was sticking through his arm, the hilt almost touching his skin so that he was pinned to the table like a picture on a cork board. A soft whimper escaped his lips when he tried to move his fingers and found he could. The knife was turned so that the blade slid in between his two bones, and although it had sliced through muscle, he still had use of his hand. Already a puddle of blood had formed underneath his arm.

Draco could hear the laughter of the surrounding Death Eaters and then the Dark Lord stepped closer.

"Does it hurt?" he inquired. "Would it hurt if I did this?"

The Dark Lord grabbed his hand and pulled. Draco cried out at the agony, his body spasming at the torment.

"Oh, Merlin, oh ga-," he cut off because something was happening. The blade seemed to be growing warm and he turned wild grey eyes onto the knife impaling his arm.

"This is not an ordinary knife," said the Dark Lord. "This is to ensure that you will always carry this scar, just as my followers will always carry my mark."

Draco hardly heard him. The knife was starting to burn, the blade changing colors from silver steel to a glowing yellow. Instinct and reflex urged him to pull away but every time he moved his arm his skin pressed harder against the blade. His skin was beginning to blister at the heat and he could hardly hear above the roaring in his ears. He tried to concentrate on his breathing but the next wave of pain wiped out all thought from his mind.

"Merde," he gasped, not aware that he was saying anything. "Merde."

He could hear laughter around him, could feel the heat only growing. His right knee bent, his heel digging into the table only to drag back down again. He bit off a yell, only half conscious to the fact that he was shaking, his muscles strained to the point of snapping as the skin on his arm melted. He could hear his ragged breaths, harsh and raspy, and then the fire grew again, the knife a blazing orange.

This time he heard the hiss of his skin and muscle on the blade, the smell of burning flesh causing him to gag as his trembling increased. A scream rose in his throat again, but he bit down once more, only a strangled cry leaving his lips. Black spots rose up in front of his vision but he didn't pass out. Part of his mind recognized that he should have been unconscious by now, that the human brain can only handle so much before it shuts down out of self-preservation, and so something in the knife itself must be keeping him alert, but the thought was engulfed by the blazing fire encompassing his mind. He wished he would pass out because he could bite back the scream any more.

The blade turned a hell-fire red and suddenly Draco didn't have to worry about screaming because he couldn't get a breath in. His body convulsed and his eyes rolled back in their sockets. He was choking and writhing and his muscles began to seize up. Just as the lack of oxygen pushed him towards unconsciousness, the heat faded from the blade.

Draco's body reflexively breathed in like a man half-drowned and the release was a smothered moan. He was covered in sweat and the blood that had drained from the hole in his arm. His limbs were still twitching as the over-stimulated, abused nerve endings fired randomly and Draco could only try to calm his breathing.

Deep breathing, that was all he needed to stop the tremors, deep breathing and forcing his mind passed the shooting pain, onto something else. The Dark Lord walked into his line of vision

"I'm sorry," said Voldemort, bending over him. "Did that hurt?"

Draco decided that he did not like the look on Voldemort's face and his instincts held true when the Dark Lord grabbed his hand once more and pulled.

The scream tore from his lips as blinding white flames shot straight from his arm to his head and he could feel his body jerk, but then the darkness descended and Draco thankfully dove in.

"Well, Lucius, he didn't beg," said Voldemort, standing next to the table, bending over the unconscious form of Draco Malfoy.

"He was raised a Malfoy," said the elder Malfoy composedly.

Voldemort chuckled. "And that makes all the difference, does it?"

Lucius Malfoy raised an eyebrow in an expression Ron had seen so many times on Draco. He now knew where Draco had learned it from.

"But of course," said Lucius, in the still even tones. Ron wondered if he even cared that his son had a knife sticking through his arm.

"I thought he wasn't a Malfoy anymore," said Voldemort.

Ron frowned, or rather, he would have had he not been gagged. Draco was disowned? Of course, now it all made sense. Draco with his niece, Draco with Harry and Hermione, Draco being Head Boy. Ron felt a moment of betrayal by his best friends. They hadn't told him? Then again, Malfoy probably hadn't wanted them to, but still, since when did that stop them before? He pulled himself out of his revere when Lucius answered.

"A Malfoy is always a Malfoy, in name or not. There is no mistaking us."

"Is that so," queried Voldemort.

Ron knew, from the Dark Lord's tone of voice, that he was not pleased with the self-assurance and if he had been Lucius Malfoy, he would have dropped the subject. Lucius Malfoy, however, was not him and he merely arched his eyebrow even further.

"Surely you have felt the same way with your proud heritage?"

Ron knew that could be taken two ways, especially in the dry tones as uttered by Lucius Malfoy. It could be that Malfoy was merely commenting on Voldemort's connection with Slytherin. Or it could be, what Ron suspected it was, a slight barb on Voldemort's Muggle father. He wondered if Lucius did have an inkling of concern for his son and this was retaliation for torturing the disowned heir of the Malfoy Estate.

"I do not like your tone, Lucius," Voldemort warned.

Lucius looked faintly surprised and then both his eyebrows rose in understanding.

"Ah," he said lightly. "I meant, of course, your noble association with Salazaar Slytherin. I would not seek to offend."

He would not seek to offend, but that didn't mean he hadn't.

Voldemort narrowed his eyes, but Lucius was already walking away, calling an excuse over his shoulder.

"I do hope you will forgive me, milord. I have letters to send to the Ministry."

And then the Malfoy patriarch was gone leaving Voldemort to seethe at the unresponsive form of the younger Malfoy. It obviously wasn't helping any because Voldemort swept out of the room.

"Wormtail, guard the boys. You lot, with me."

The room emptied of Death Eaters, leaving only Wormtail, the one who had once been Ron's rat. Once the room was emptied Wormtail shivered with glee and immediately crossed to the fire to sink into the armchair that had been Voldemort's.

Ron glanced at the Death Eater and then furiously rubbed his cheek on his shoulder, trying to dislodge the gag. It took him a few moments, but the cloth finally fell from his lips. Ron once again glanced towards the fireplace and then back towards the limp form of his school enemy.

"Malfoy!" he hissed.

No response.

"Malfoy!" he tried a little louder.

Still no response, and on closer evaluation, Malfoy looked alarmingly pale.

Ron shuffled his feet, jerking against the bindings. The chair slid forward half an inch, the sound muffled by the thick, oriental carpet it was sitting on. Ron jerked again, another half inch. It seemed to take him half of forever before he reached the table.

"Malfoy!" he tried again. "Draco!" The name sounded foreign on his tongue.

Calling was obviously not working, so he shuffled a bit closer and managed to nudge the table with his shoulder. Draco groaned and the sound made Ron wince, looking over to the fireplace. Wormtail hadn't moved. Ron hit the table again. Another groan and Draco stirred.

"Malfoy!" Ron hissed. "Malfoy, you have to wake up!"

Draco's head turned in his direction and the eyes fluttered open. Draco's expression was one of pain and confusion before the eyes grew guarded.

"Weasley," Draco managed, his voice breathy, "wha-,"

"Shh," ordered Ron. "Wormtail's right over there. You have to get up to untie me so we can get out of here."

Malfoy blinked a few times, but seemed to understand. The grey eyes slid to the knife that was pinning his arm to the table.

"'Course I do," said Malfoy, resignation in his voice. The grey eyes studied the knife impaling his arm and then he grimaced, right hand coming up and reaching towards the hilt before hesitating.

"Do it all at once," said Ron. "It will hurt less that way."

The cold grey eyes went to his face. "Weasel," Draco whispered, the sneer still perfectly evident in his voice, "have you ever had a knife stuck through the ulna and radius of your lower arm, piercing, what I believe is the flexor carpi radialis? And if you have had such, have you ever had the opportunity to remove said knife in a quick jarring motion and in a slow retrieval process to better determine which method of extraction causes the least amount of activity in the nerves? If not, do not presume to tell me what will hurt less."

Ron ignored the rant. He supposed if he had ever taken a knife to the arm and then was told he would have to pull it out, he would be a little unsteady as well.

"Just do it like a bandage," he said. His mother had always pulled them off in a quick swipe so that he wouldn't chicken out half way through and just leave it on until it fell off naturally.

"That analogy does not apply here!" Malfoy hissed, but then his right arm grasped the hilt and he yanked. There was a sickening tearing noise as the skin the knife had been seared to was ripped off when the knife was pulled and there was a fresh flow of blood. Malfoy doubled up, his teeth clenched together so he wouldn't scream but he was shaking again.

"Oh, Merlin," the blond ground out, his voice breathy once more and Ron was afraid he would fall back into unconsciousness.

"Malfoy, take a deep breath," Ron commanded softly. "Deep breath. It's fine; the knife is out now. You are fine."

He could see the blond head nod once and then the labored breathing slowly deepened and spread out to a slower pace. Malfoy slowly uncurled, the bloody knife still clenched in his right hand. He pushed himself up, slowly pulling down his jacket sleeve over the gaping hole, grimacing as the fabric brushed across the wound. He slid off the table.

He was shaky on his feet, but Ron didn't say anything. Malfoy went straight to cutting the rope off of him, and once Ron was free he pulled the gag over his head and dropped it to the floor. He watched as Draco picked up the sheath to the knife and slid it in, then shoved the knife through his belt. He then picked up a long piece of rope, walking silently towards the armchair.

Ron followed, somewhat nervously.

Malfoy reached the back of the armchair and then reached over it, jerking the rope around the Death Eater's neck and pulling tight with his uninjured arm, sure to stay behind the armchair so that the flailing arms of Wormtail didn't latch onto him. Ron watched in horror as Wormtail's eyes bugged out and the silver hand tried to pull the rope away, but it was so tight around his neck that the fingers had no purchase.

The rough wheezes and grunts slowly died out and the man's face went slack, and then his body limp. Still Draco held the rope around his neck.

Ron was spurred into motion and he lunged forward, knocking the blond away and the rope fell.

"The hell are you doing?" Ron demanded. "Killing him?"

Malfoy straightened. "That was the general idea," he said.

"You can't just kill a man like that!"

"What is it with you Gryffindors?" asked Malfoy. "He will gladly kill you if told to do so, and I would feel a lot better knowing that the Death Eaters numbers are down by one."

"But he was defenseless!"

"He had his wand. He could have used it if he was a bit smarter. I'm doing the gene pool a favor in getting rid of him."

Ron spluttered. "But, you can't-,"

"I can't? Give me a good reason why not to."

"He owes Harry a life debt!" said Ron triumphantly.

Malfoy arched an eyebrow. "Is that so? In that case it would be beneficial to let him live."

Malfoy reached around the armchair and plucked the wand from Wormtail's limp fingers.

"Shall we?" he asked, and then he headed for the door, not waiting to see if Ron would follow.

"Wait, Malfoy," said Ron.

Draco turned.

"I won't…I'm not going to tell anyone. Just, I don't know if people know already, but I won't…I won't say anything, about how you're…smarter."

Draco nodded shortly. "Let's go," he said.

Ron wasn't expecting a 'thank you', so he followed the blond out the door.

He didn't exactly remember the way back to the cell, but after Draco took a left and started up a flight of stairs, he knew they were going the wrong way.

"Wait, Malfoy, where the hell are you going?" he whispered.

"Up," said Draco.

"Shouldn't we go down? Back to the others?"

"We are going back to the others."

Ron resisted the urge to groan in frustration, knowing that Draco was being enigmatic on purpose. They didn't, after all, get along.

"Then why are we going up?" he asked.

"Because once they discover we're gone, they're going to go straight back down to the dungeons and catch us on the way. There's a Floo that I can access up here, where there won't be any Death Eaters, and then we can get down to the dungeons that way."

"How do you know that there's a Floo without Death Eaters up here?"

Draco turned slightly. "It's in my room," he said.

Ron gaped, freezing on the stairs. This was Malfoy's house? Suddenly he started looking at the building with new eyes, imagining what it would be like to wake up each morning and walk half a mile to get to the kitchen while crossing marble floors and floors covered in the softest of oriental carpeting. Or walking down a staircase with a gold banister, or passing pictures of bejeweled relatives, or opening silk curtains sewn with gold thread. Of course, that had to be tempered with the fact that Malfoy's father had just stood by while Voldemort nearly tortured the life out of him, but still, it was a ridiculously extravagant house.

"Come on, Weasley!" Draco whispered, and Ron hurried to catch up.

The upper rooms seemed to be off-limits to the visiting Death Eaters, because they passed no one in the halls, not until they reached the forth floor at least, and Ron froze at the sound of unsteady footsteps. Draco didn't, looking back at him.

"It's just mother," he said.

And then Narcissa Malfoy came into view. She still looked to be twenty-eight, though Ron knew she must be in her forties. Her skin was pale and her long golden hair was spilling down her back. She was dressed in a sapphire-blue satin gown with a string of pearls around her neck, on it a diamond pendant larger than a galleon.

"Hello, Mother," said Draco as she passed.

Narcissa seemed to notice them for the first time, and when she turned, Ron was startled to see that her pupils were dilated and her expression glassy. She was either drunk or high. Maybe both.

"What?" asked Narcissa. "Oh, it's you. Where is your Father? I need to go to Florence again. Vinnie just owled and said he would love to see me again." She simpered prettily, but then looked at Draco again and frowned. "Your uncle Vinnie, of course."

Draco arched an eyebrow. "Ah, yes. Uncle Vinnie. What side of the family is he from again? I wasn't aware that we were Italian." Narcissa looked somewhat peeved, but then Draco was speaking again. "I believe Father might be with the Dark Lord. Mother, do you know if Father disconnected the Floo in my room?"

Narcissa frowned. "Why would he do that? Get away from me and stop asking stupid questions."

She continued down the hall, weaving slightly. Ron stared after her, too shocked to clearly work things through in his head, but then Draco was moving again and Ron followed, pushing the troubling thoughts away. He would think about it all later.

Draco came to a door and hesitantly reached out before turning the handle. He stepped inside and immediately the room lit and the fire in the large marble grate sprang into life. Ron gaped as he entered, just remembering to shut the door.

The room was huge, and he could see doors that led to other rooms as well. There was one of the largest beds Ron had ever seen beside one wall with black silk sheets and emerald green blankets. The bed curtains were also green silk with silver thread. There was a small settee and two armchairs in front of the fire with several bookshelves and a large wardrobe stood in a corner.

Draco stared for a second as well, looking about the room with a faint expression of surprise on his face.

"He didn't change it," he said. He crossed over to the wardrobe and pulled it open. A closet full of clothing was revealed. Draco walked to the mantle, examining the trophies on it for various thestral-riding competitions and what not. The trophies were still polished and untouched by dust.

Ron would say that Draco smiled, but it was hardly a twitch of the lips, and the expression was more of a look of contentment than any real delight, but then again, Ron doubted the Malfoys would do such a menial thing as grin, so maybe in the Malfoy language, it was a smile.

Draco seemed to shake himself out of his thoughts and then crossed to a door and pulled it open. He jerked his head for Ron to follow him. There was a short hallway and then Draco pulled open another door into what looked like his own private study with a potion's lab set up in the back.

"What are you doing?" asked Ron.

"Wasting time," said Draco. He looked up at Ron. "I'm waiting until the Death Eaters think that we've escaped on our own before heading down."

"What?"

Draco smirked. "Trust me. I'm a genius." He crossed over to a cupboard and pulled the door open. He took out a crystal bottle of what looked like something alcoholic, put it on the table, and then returned for two glasses. It was then that Ron realized that Draco wasn't using his left hand. He wondered how badly it hurt.

"Have you ever had a drink, Weasley?" asked Draco, slightly condescendingly.

Ron bristled. "Yes," he said.

"How much before you start being noticeably affected?"

Ron shrugged slightly. "Maybe two firewhiskeys."

Draco raised an eyebrow and poured an inch and a half of the liquid into a glass with some difficulty. Ron realized that Draco must be left handed if he couldn't fill a glass with his right hand.

"Here," said Draco, holding out the glass to Ron.

"What for?" asked Ron, somewhat suspiciously. He didn't think that drinking was exactly the best thing to do when trapped in a Death Eater fortress.

"You were just under the Cruciatus," said Draco. "Right now you don't notice it because the adrenaline is keeping the pain from registering, but your nerve endings are pretty much fried. The alcohol helps keep you loose, believe me, I know."

"From experience?" asked Ron.

"From experience," said Draco.

Ron took the glass and then watched as Draco poured only an inch into his own.

"Lightweight, Malfoy?" he asked, not being able to resist the dig on his school rival.

Draco grimaced. "Just remember, I'm the one in charge of this escape plan. I might just leave you here."

Ron snorted, but raised his glass.

"To getting out of here alive and unharmed."

"Little late for that," said Draco.

"To getting out alive and relatively capable of functioning," Ron amended.

Draco smirked, and clinked his glass to Ron's. "Hear, hear," he remarked drolly.

They both downed the alcohol.

Aww, poor Draco. Anyways, the escape is next chapter and someone isn't going to make it out, another is going to be seriously wounded, and Bill gets to be worried. Sound like fun? You know it.





19. Of Escapes and the Number Four

Disclaimer: If I owned Harry Potter, all of my weeks would be Spring Break.

Author's note: Sorry about the late update. I was going to update last minute yesterday (aka, midnight) and then my computer decided to freeze….yeah.

Anna: Glad to hear that you liked the toast at the end, I thought it was a somewhat upbeat ending for an intense chapter. As for wine, yeah, it hits me rather hard too.

Sabireru: I'm sorry. All this time you've been waiting for Draco's animagi form, and the time when he finally transfigures, I'm late with the chapter. That sucks…

Sanjs: When I was writing it I was trying to imagine what a knife through the arm would feel like, but I really couldn't comprehend it, so I'm glad that it came across well. Thanks for the review!

RekkaKouyuu: 'Kill one of the kids'? LOL! But, you know, Draco didn't join the Dark Lord because he didn't agree with the whole 'kill the kids' type thing, so I doubt he'll let that happen…

Lilith: Yay! I was so afraid that something had happened when you didn't review the last chapter, but I couldn't exactly say anything like 'hey, where are you? You ok?' because then people would think that I am one of those crazy writers that keeps tabs on all of their reviewers and stalks them if they miss a chapter…which I'm not. So glad to hear that it was just the internet, and not anything else, and it makes me happy to hear from you. How's Spyrit? Again, not doing a freaky stalker thing…

Drewberry: Glad you liked the blood and what not. Thanks for the review!

Mask: No, Draco's dad is not Chuck Norris. Just cuz he's cool, doesn't mean he's automatically related to the best action figure in all times, well, him and Jack Bauer…

Bena24: Well, maybe not exactly friends, just cuz I don't think any of them would really admit to it, but they'll be more understanding

WildlyObsessed: Better than Jo? Wow, I'm flattered (preens slightly) Thanks for the review!

Carla: Let me clarify my meaning last chapter. Someone isn't going to make it out, as in, not managing the escape. I don't know if I could really kill off a main character just yet…maybe in the third story…(hmm, not a bad idea) Thank so much for reviewing, and I'm glad that your enjoying the story.

R2D2: Thanks! I'm glad that you liked the action.

Wingsand Claws: Yeah, a few people liked the torture scene as well, and to be frank, there has to be some moments in a story where the main character gets beat up. Or, maybe I'm just weird. Huh.

Angelof Dragons: Hey, thank you very much! Glad you like it.

Freyalyn: Umm, nope, no new chapter cuz my computer froze. But it's better now, so it'll be up in ten minutes. Of course, by the time you read this, it will already be up….

Draco coughed slightly at the burn of the alcohol. It was just a weak brandy, but he had never been much of a drinker. Ron, to the side of him, blinked back a few tears and shook his head.

"Good stuff," he said.

Draco smirked and put his glass down, walking over to the shelves and pulling out a jar of blue liquid and then a few clean towels that he used to dry his instruments when experimenting with potions. He cut the towels into strips with Wormtail's wand, noting the effects of the spell. It was much weaker than he was used to, and the magic drifted to the right, but it was still operable, and Draco had been trained to duel with both hands, so the fact that his left was injured wouldn't affect his spell casting as well.

"Weasley," he said.

"What?"

"I need your assistance."

Ron walked over, eyeing the jar suspiciously. "What's that?" he asked.

"A crude form of anti-bacterial cleanser," said Draco. "In other words, it prevents infection."

"What do you need with it?"

"Well, there is a rather large hole in my arm. I was planning on bandaging it."

"Oh," said Ron.

Draco rolled his eyes and pulled up his sleeve, getting his first good look at his arm.

"Sick," managed Ron, turning away from the wound. Draco didn't have such luxury.

The knife had pierced his arm right where the Dark Mark would have been placed. The skin and muscle had been burned black, but in some areas the burnt flesh had been ripped away when Draco had pulled the knife out of his arm. That was where the majority of the blood was welling from, trickling down his arm to drip off his fingers.

Draco was beginning to feel the pain of his arm. After he had pulled the knife out, after he had knocked out Wormtail, the adrenaline had begun to kick in and his mind had taken over, running through escape plans and pushing any thought of his arm to the side. Now, however, it was beginning to hurt. Badly.

"Open the bottle, Weasley."

"What?"

"The jar, open it."

Ron pulled the lid off the jar and Draco picked it up, walking over to the sink and stretching his left arm over the drain.

"You aren't seriously-," Ron started, but Draco had already dumped the contents of the jar over the wound.

"Shit!" he ground out as the pain spiked again, clutching at the counter to keep himself upright. "Shit."

He breathed in heavily through his nose and released through his mouth as the intense sting slowly faded into throbbing and then he picked up the strips of towel.

"Weasley, I need your hand again."

Ron looked as if he was going to be ill just glancing at Draco's arm, but he came closer.

"Hold the end, will you?"

"Yeah," said Ron, screwing up his face in disgust.

Draco managed to wrap the make-shift bandage around his arm a few times and then, again with Weasley's help, tied the ends together. Red already began to seep through the cloth and Draco cursed the fact he didn't have any medical potions easily accessible.

"That doesn't look to good," said Ron.

"Tell me something I don't know."

The pain seemed to lessen with the presence of the bandage, purely psychological Draco knew, and he pulled his sleeve back down, noting the blood that was staining the left side of his jacket. He frowned; he liked the coat.

Draco then walked to his study fireplace and lit the grate. "I think we gave them enough time," he said. "Are you ready to get out of here, Weasley?"

"I never wanted to be at your house in the first place."

Draco smirked and then threw in a pinch of Floo powder. "The wine cellar," he commanded.

"You have a fireplace in the wine cellar?" asked Ron.

"Well, it was originally the dungeons, but then the house was expanded. The fireplace is mostly hidden and I don't think anyone knows about it. Follow me in ten seconds."

He took a handful of Floo powder and pocketed it before stepping through the flames. The cellar fireplace wasn't used, meaning there wasn't already a supply. He appeared in the well-kept wine cellar of the Malfoy Estate. The fireplace was in the back corner, and so Draco crept around the shelves, making sure that none of the Death Eaters had ventured this far.

He turned as Ron stepped out as well.

"It's clear," he said.

The family did not access the dungeons through the wine cellar as the main entrance was a floor up and in the eastern wing. That, however, did not mean that it was impossible to get to the dungeons from there. Like most old wizarding homes, the Malfoy Estate held a plethora of back passage ways and hidden staircases.

Draco pulled open the trapdoor in the middle of the room and climbed down the ladder, favoring his left arm. Ron followed after him, remembering to close the door without being told to do so.

This particular trapdoor led to the hall just outside of the dungeon, the exit concealed with a hidden doorway. Draco peered out the door, making sure the way was clear. He was hoping that the Death Eaters would assume that he and Ron had tried leaving the building and were searching for them elsewhere, preferably outside the house. Draco knew that such a plan was the most logical one, and so he was hoping by following the illogical one (getting the other students out as well), they wouldn't be discovered by patrols. That wasn't the only reason for going back though.

Draco paused outside the door leading to the dungeon cell that held the other students and McGonagall and turned to Ron.

"I don't know how many Death Eaters are guarding them now and it could be a little tricky."

"I'm game."

Draco passed him the knife. "Just in case."

"Let's do it," Ron nodded, grasping the knife like a sword.

Draco smashed open the door and the two burst through.

There were four Death Eaters at the table, guarding the prisoners. Apparently the Dark Lord had thought that there was a possibility Draco would go back for the other prisoners and had placed more of a guard, but Draco was pleased the number was not higher.

Draco did not target one Death Eater first. Instead he jerked the wand yelling out "Flabrorum!" A gust of wind swooped at the Death Eaters who had just raised their own wands, throwing them backwards.

Draco jumped down the last of the stairs, calling out two more spells as inwardly he cursed the fact that he did not have his own wand. Controlling someone else's wand is almost as hard as casting the Imperious curse, because the unfamiliar caster must impose his own will on the magic. When the magic core of the wand is not in sync with the caster, the spells that result are often unpredictable and wild. It also meant that Draco had to speak aloud his curses for additional strength, which gave the Death Eaters the decided advantage.

Both of Draco's spells were deflected, hitting the stone walls and blasting out a chunk of rock. Draco ducked under the explosion of debris, calling up a temporary shield to block the returning fire. He dropped the shield the next instant and let loose a slew of dark hexes, managing to hit two of the Death Eaters.

Draco rolled under a slicing hex, responding to that curse with the curse that blew out the eardrums of the victim. The Death Eater fell, but the shield Draco tried to pull up to block the blasting hex sent by the remaining Death Eater was a second too late in forming because of the unfamiliar wand.

The curse hit Draco dead in the chest, smashing him backwards and into the side of the stairs. He fell to the floor, trying to push away the black that rose up again, knowing that to lose consciousness would only put an end to the escape. He needn't have bothered.

Ron jumped on the Death Eater, plunging the long knife into the man's back. There was a gurgled cry and then the Death Eater toppled to the floor.

"Nice one, Weasel," said Draco, pushing himself up to his feet.

"Not bad yourself, ferret."

Draco snorted and then stooped by the Death Eaters, retrieving their wands. He held them each for a few seconds to get a feel for which wand was closest to his own. He finally settled on one made of cherry wood and crossed the room to the prison.

The students had been huddled in a corner by McGonagall during the attack, in case a spell went wide, but now they were getting up, staring wide-eyed at the two boys who had just taken on the Death Eaters.

McGonagall was eyeing Draco suspiciously, but Draco refused to look her way. He examined the lock on the gate and then realized the locking spell used was too difficult to be countered without his own wand.

"Weasley, check them for a key, will you?"

"Already have it," said Ron, holding up a large silver key.

"Good," said Draco. He stepped back and let Ron open the gate, crossing over to the Death Eater Ron had stabbed. The man was close to death and Draco pulled the knife out of the man's back, wiping the blade on the Death Eater's robe and finding the sheath. He found that the knife fit mostly inside his pocket, although the hilt stuck out some. Weapons were always an important part of an escape.

He surveyed the fallen Death Eaters, making sure all of them were really incapacitated and not just faking it. He frowned at the bodies. Something was brushing at the corner of his mind, something that he should know, but couldn't quite annunciate it. It had to do with the number four. He pushed the doubts aside and walked back over to the students, looking at Ron and McGonagall.

"Alright, here's the plan," he said. "I can get us to a fireplace easily enough, and then, our best bet is to make it to the owlery, because from there we can get out. I'll lead since I'm the only one that knows where he's going. Weasel, you take up the rear, be our lookout. Professor, just keep track of all the students because if one falls behind, I'm not stopping, understood?"

McGonagall looked at him a little warily, but the distrust and dislike, that usually tempered her features when he was around, was gone.

"You know where you are going?" she asked.

"It's his house," said Ron.

Draco grimaced at McGonagall's questioning look and held out the five wands he gathered from the Death Eaters.

"The cherry wood is my best match, but let me know if it's closer for you two," he said.

Both Ron and McGonagall looked through the wands, Ron taking a dogwood and McGonagall a mahogany. Draco took the cherry wood and then turned to the fourth year.

"You, David Sutherfield."

The fourth year looked up, blue eyes wide and frightened.

"Take a wand," said Draco. "The one that feels best to you."

David took the other that was not Wormtail's and then Draco picked out a blonde second year that was in Hufflepuff.

"It's Katerina Wuthers, right?"

Katerina nodded.

"And your dad's an Auror?"

"Yes."

"Did he teach you any Defense?"

"A little."

"Alright, here's a wand. Just go for the simple curses, and make them big, got it?"

She nodded and then Draco turned back to Ron and McGonagall. "We have to be fast. This way."

Draco led the group up the dungeon stairs and out the door. He pulled open the secret doorway and started up the ladder. Going down the ladder had been no problem as he hadn't really needed to use his left arm, but now it was difficult not to use it, and every time there was even the slightest jar on his hand or shoulder, the wound flared up.

Still, even he was faster than some of the smaller children and it was all he could do not to snap at them to hurry up. He peered out of the door of the wine cellar, trying to see if he could tell exactly where the Death Eaters were, but the hall was empty.

"Shit," he whispered.

He turned back to find that the students had made it up to the wine cellar and that Ron was just closing the door.

"We'll take the Floo to the top floor," said Draco, coming over to Ron and McGonagall. "The owlery is a tower on the far east side, and I can get us to the beginning of the wing, but not all the way down."

"What?" asked Ron. "No Floo in the owlery, Malfoy?"

Draco ignored that remark and threw a pinch of Floo on the fireplace. "Wait ten seconds before sending the first kid through," he said to Ron and McGonagall, and then he stepped through, calling out 'Fifth floor parlor'.

The room he appeared in was empty, and he quickly did a perimeter scan and then opened the door to peer through. The hall seemed to be deserted. Draco frowned; it was almost too easy. The number four bugged him again. He waited until all of the students made it to the room, Ron and McGonagall following close behind.

"It's down this hall," he told them. "The owlery has windows that are not warded, so we can leave through there. Follow me closely."

Once again the group slipped silently down the hall. Draco was on high alert, knowing something was full out wrong now. This whole escape plan was going too easily, and what was it with the number four? Surely they would have passed a Death Eater by now, and only four Death Eaters guarding the cell? Honestly, four was the number that Draco felt he could safely handle with a wand not his own. Five was cutting it too close.

He felt a sudden cold chill creep up his back. This wasn't an escape; it was a cat playing with a mouse. This was purely a psychological mind trick, and one that, had it succeeded, would have been jarring indeed, especially for a genius.

Draco pulled open another door, the fifth floor east wing guest room, or rather, one of them.

"In!" he commanded. "Everyone in now!"

The students ran in, frightened by his tone of voice. McGonagall and Ron approached him curiously, but Draco roughly shoved Weasley in, and then actually reached out to guide the professor in by the arm as well. He shut the door, and then warded it with every dark ward he could conjure with his stolen wand.

"What is it?" asked Ron.

Draco leaned against the door, tipping his head back to rest against the wood.

"I'm an idiot."

"That's not what you told Voldemort."

"Yeah, well maybe I'm having an off-day."

"What's the problem?"

"Doesn't this just seem a little too easy for you?" asked Draco.

"A cat," said McGonagall.

Draco smirked. "I thought of that analogy as well."

"What do you mean a cat?" asked Ron.

"You have a cat, Weasley? Ever seen it play with a mouse? It will let the mouse think that it escaped time and time again until the mouse just gives up. It makes the mouse taste better, or something."

"So he's letting us escape?"

"Why would he leave us in a room with only one Death Eater?"

"But I was tied up, and you were unconscious. You had a bloody knife through your arm!"

McGonagall looked at Draco, and for the first time, there was concern directed towards him.

"Are you well, Mr. Malfoy?"

"I'm fine," said Draco, "but we really need to get out of here."

"What about the fireplace? We Flooed to this floor, can't we Floo out?"

Draco shook his head. "Only certain fireplaces are set up to receive the Floo. This fireplace isn't one of them, and even if we did make it back to the parlor, we could only Floo around the house. To Floo to an outside location requires an escort by family."

"But you are-," started McGonagall, but Draco cut in.

"I've just been captured along with Order members and a bunch of students. Do you really think that I'm still a part of the Malfoy family? Lucius will have barred my access."

There was a strained silence and then Ron pointed to the far wall with the French window and cushioned window seat. "Can we climb out the window?"

"All windows are locked from the outside. Only family can access them, and again, not exactly a Malfoy anymore."

"Could we Apparate?" asked McGonagall. "Or make a Portkey? I know with unfamiliar wands it would be risky, but we have nothing else."

"The Malfoy Estate is protected by anti-Apparition wards, as well as anti-Portkey ones. The wards can be dropped, but the only reason they would be dropped is if the Death Eaters had thought we had escaped and they needed to Apparate after us."

Ron and McGonagall looked defeated, as did the children who had been listening into the conversation with wide eyes.

"So we are being toyed with by a very smart cat then," said McGonagall.

Draco blinked. His fingers tapped out the 1-3-2-4 pattern as his mind spun. He turned to McGonagall.

"Can you call up your animagi form with that wand?"

"Yes. Why?"

"Because I think I can too."

"You are an animagus?"

"I'm not exactly registered."

"You haven't even graduated yet."

Draco smirked again. "I taught myself when I was thirteen."

He savored the shocked look on McGonagall's face while he ironed out the details of his plan in his mind.

"Alright," he said. "Weasley, stay here. Do not open the door until a cat scratches on it, got that?"

"What are you going to do?"

"You'll see," Draco promised. "Professor, you're going to have to come with me."

McGonagall nodded, and Draco slowly opened the door, counting on the fact that Voldemort would have set up an ambush, and would not be patrolling the halls, or if he was, he wouldn't attack until the actually attempted to leave. The corridor was indeed empty and Draco and McGonagall slipped out, and the door was closed behind them.

"I assume you have a plan?" the Professor asked softly.

"Our owlery is the only room that doesn't have warded windows. My father and the Dark Lord no doubt believe that I would lead you there to escape and they will be waiting for us. I need you to change into a cat and stir up the owls."

"What are you going to do?"

"I'm going to fly out while you provide me owl cover, then I want you to run back to the room and wait for me there."

"You're going to fly out?"

Draco smirked, opening a door at the end of the hall and walking up a wide, stone stair case. He stopped at the door on the top.

"Are you ready?"

McGonagall morphed seamlessly into the tabby cat form and Draco flung open the door.

He could see the Death Eaters waiting, stepping out of the shadows, but then McGonagall was in action, letting out a mewl that caused the owls in the room to jerk around, and then the tabby was leaping at the birds.

There was a cacophony of squawks and screeches and a flurry of feathers as the owls took flight. Draco waved his wand and morphed as well, losing his human form, and shrinking. It took only a matter of seconds, and then a Black Merlin falcon rose with the flood of owls, disappearing within the frantic wings, and then the mass of owls was racing to the high windows.

The cat, which was a target of the Death Eater spells took note of the black falcon with the injured wing, and darted about the room for a few more seconds before streaking to the door.

Draco loved to fly. Normally, switching over to his animagus form meant that he could go wherever he pleased, mainly skimming over fields and performing a series of acrobatic stunts he wished he could perform on a broom. No doubt Potter could come close.

This time, however, was different, and he followed the mass of owls out the windows into the night and then glided down to the fifth floor. It was difficult, flying when his arm was pierced through, but because the knife had missed his bones, it meant that his falcon form was spared the breaks as well.

Still, it wasn't easy and it took him a few tries until he landed just on the edge of the window sill of the fifth floor east wing guest room, the third on the left. He scrambled a few times to get his grasp, alerting the attention of some of the smaller students who came to gape at the bird landing on the window.

Draco could see McGonagall return, and then the door was shut again. McGonagall returned to her normal self, but her still keen eye sight spotted the falcon on the window.

Once Draco was sure that changing out of his bird form wasn't going to send him falling, he morphed back, causing the students to stare at him in amazement. Draco found the latch to the window and lifted it, pulling the window open and then scrambling through.

"You're bleeding again," said Ron, pointing to his left arm.

Draco figured, from the increase in pain, that he had torn the wound again, and upon glancing down, he saw that his jacket sleeve was slowly turning a muddy brown as the blood stained the green fabric and his hand was smeared red.

"Doesn't matter," he said.

A few students jumped when there was a pounding on the door. It seems that the Dark Lord realized his little ambush had failed. Draco wasn't worried. The wards on the door would hold for a few more minutes, and that was all he needed.

He turned to the windows and threw both of them open, peering down below, but night had fallen and it was impossible to see the ground. Perfect. He turned back to Weasley, reaching for the necklace Bill had given him and pulling it over his head.

"Weasley, you need to do something for me," he said.

"What?" asked Ron.

Draco pulled the boy over to a corner and talked softly, but swiftly. "When you get out, you need to get to your brother Bill, and you need to give him this." He pressed the necklace into Ron's hand.

"What? Why?"

"I'm not finished. Listen very carefully because everything is riding on you giving Bill this message. You need to tell him that the ritual calls for payment, the soul has to cross the river."

"What ritual? What's going on?"

"Weasley! Just listen, alright? There is a display at the England Museum of old coins, and there is a case of coins from Ancient Rome. The coins are from the period of Quintus Flavius. Bill needs to get all of the coins but one out of the museum. He needs to make it so the display is sent to another museum, or stolen, or something, and only one coin must remain. Then, four nights from now, he should set up a team of Aurors at the Veil in the Ministry of Magic. Got that? One coin from the Quintus Flavius period should remain and four nights from now the Aurors at the Veil."

"Malfoy, I don't-,"

"You don't have to understand. You just have to do it."

"Why can't you just tell him?"

Draco silently swore at the fact that Gryffindors got so concerned and worried.

"It's just a precaution. Now, come this way, all of you."

Draco pulled open the door in the back of the room. It led to the adjoining bath and toilet.

"The Death Eaters will think that we climbed out the window," said Draco, making sure that all of the students got in. Ron and McGonagall were last to enter the room, both of them looking at him curiously.

"Won't they look over here?" asked Ron.

"No," said Draco.

"Why not?" asked McGonagall.

Draco shrugged. "Because I'll tell them that you went out the window."

"Malfoy, what-," Ron started, just as McGonagall reached out to him, obviously figuring out what he was going to do.

Draco jumped back and slammed the door shut, locking it quickly with a dark curse, and then throwing a few more on, just to be sure that they couldn't get out.

"Malfoy, what the hell!" Ron yelled. "What are you doing? Was this all some sort of plan for Voldemort?"

"Weasley, shut the hell up," Draco yelled back. "Listen, the necklace I gave you is a Portkey, are you listening?"

"We're listening," came McGonagall's displeased voice.

"The necklace is a Portkey, and if I can get the Death Eaters to believe that you all have escaped they will take down the wards. To activate the Portkey, simply flip the charm over. Make sure all of you are holding onto the necklace. Now, the Portkey was supposed to go to Hogwarts, but there are special wards on the house that will only let you Portkey just outside the Malfoy property line. From there on, you're on your own. You have to make it to the wizarding town at the end of the road and you can Floo out."

"What the bloody hell are you going to do?"

"First, I'm going to get you out. Then, I'm going to get a whole army of Death Eaters to be at the Ministry at one time and hopefully organize the biggest blow to the Death Eaters since Potter's birth."

"Malfoy, you're mad!"

"And I'm putting a silencing charm up now so your mouth doesn't give you away. Remember, tell your brother Bill. That part is important."

"I will," said Ron.

"Good," said Draco. He cast the silencing charm.

The pounding on the door was getting louder, and Draco took in a breath to steel himself. He walked over to the window and put a foot on the ledge.

He whirled around when the door burst open and the Death Eaters stormed in and then launched himself over the window sill.

He had fallen only three feet before the curse caught hold of him and he was jerked back into the room, landing hard on the floor. He responded with his own barrage of hexes and then struggled to his feet, running for the window once again.

This time he was physically stopped, an arm jerking around his neck and ripping the wand from his hand. He struggled, but then a fist was clamped around his left arm and he doubled over in pain, smothering a cry.

He was pulled upright as the Dark Lord stalked closer and Draco sneered at the man.

"So, your ambush didn't work out quite as well as you would have liked, did it?"

The Dark Lord's hand struck out and Draco's head whipped to the side from the force of the blow. Blood dribbled down his chin from where Voldemort had split his lip.

Draco laughed, spitting out blood. "What? Thought that you could out wit me, Half-blood?"

The Death Eaters froze at the insult. The Dark Lord reached out, fingers snarling in his hair as he jerked Draco's head back.

"Right now you are trying to distract me so that your little friends can get farther away. Honestly, Draco, jumping out a window? Not exactly dignified behavior."

"Maybe I just wanted to see you jump after them," said Draco. "I could put that memory in a Pensive and sell it. The Ministry could use it as propaganda against joining the suicidal Dark Lord."

The Dark Lord leered at Draco. "I won't be doing any jumping." He turned as Lucius Malfoy strode into the room.

The Malfoy patriarch hardly glanced Draco's way, but turned straight to the Dark Lord.

"You called, milord?"

"Drop the wards," said Voldemort. "We're going children-hunting, and I want them all alive, but not necessarily unharmed."

He smiled wickedly and Lucius nodded, waving his wand in a complicated pattern.

The shields crackled off and Draco silently urged Ron to get the children away. His tension must have showed, and if Draco had merely been in a room of Death Eaters, no one would have noticed, but his father was in the room, and his father had always been able to read him.

"Milord," said Lucius, watching his eyes even though Draco was avoiding his gaze. "Have you checked the bath?"

Voldemort turned to Lucius, and then whirled around to the bathroom room.

"Open that door!" he commanded.

A few Death Eaters ran forward, only to come up against the wards.

"It won't open!" one Death Eater called back.

Voldemort grunted in frustration and waved his wand. The Death Eater dropped, screaming in pain, and the others backed away as the Dark Lord strode over to the door.

The wards weren't particularly strong or clever, as Draco had been using a stolen wand, but it was still somewhat frightening to see the Dark Lord rip through them in a matter of seconds.

The door was flung open and the Dark Lord turned back.

"It is empty," he said to Lucius.

Lucius shook his head, his expression unreadable, and when he spoke his tone was matter-of-fact. "No doubt it was not so before the wards were taken down."

Draco tensed as his father walked closer to him, forcing himself not to flinch when Lucius' hand reached out to tilt Draco's head up. His father tapped his bare neck lightly, noticing the absence of the necklace.

"A Portkey, Draco? That will not get them very far."

Draco couldn't look his father in the eye, couldn't even look at his father's face, so he stared at the Dark Lord instead.

"It will get them far enough."

The Dark Lord screamed in frustration, striding over to Draco, his lips pulled back over his teeth and his red eyes flashing. Draco experienced a moment of fear and then the Dark Lord was grabbing him away from the Death Eater, the long, pale fingers around his neck.

"You will regret that," he hissed, and then he threw Draco backwards into the wall.

Draco hit the wall with a jarring force, taking the brunt of the impact on his back where he would no doubt have bruises for a fortnight, but then his head snapped backwards from the abrupt spot. He had already hit his earlier that day, on the steps of the dock, and pain blossomed, wrapping his mind in darkness. He registered the enraged form of the Dark Lord yelling out orders to get the students back, and he had one moment to hope that the Weasel and the others were running to the town and not dawdling, else the Dark Lord would catch them, and then Draco thought of nothing as the darkness over took him.

The minute that Bill was informed of the attack on Hogwarts, he had Flooed to Hogsmeade. Students were pouring into the town, some injured and all of them badly shaken, telling stories about how the Death Eaters had just appeared in the school.

The first surge of students had been those nearest the exits, and then slowly more trickled in as evacuation routes were put into use. One of those routes had been the boats that had arrived on the dock of Hogsmeade.

The Aurors had arrived, those on the assault team heading straight to the castle while others started organizing the student refugees into groups and getting their names to contact their parents. The villagers of Hogsmeade had risen to the occasion. After all, these students had been the ones to visit during weekends and to buy toys or to go out to eat. These were the innocents, and had any Death Eaters actually showed up in the towns, the Aurors wouldn't have had a chance to get the Death Eaters into custody. The townsfolk would have attacked first.

The Aurors had set up tents for the children, complete with cots, blankets and mediwitches, and Madame Rosmerta and the workers at the Three Broomsticks were passing out butterbeers to the children. Honeydukes was passing out chocolate. The workers at the post office were sending letters and paying for the postage out of their own pocket, and a whole slew of mothers were there to comfort the little ones.

Bill noted that mostly Gryffindors were coming in by the boats, being helped out by the Aurors who would send them to a mediwitch and then to the tents, and so that was where he stationed himself. He was immediately set to work helping the Aurors unload the children, but Bill was glad to assist. His whole family was in Gryffindor, as was little Laney Chalmers-Malfoy, and Bill had no doubt that Ron, Ginny, and Draco would be leaving the school by this route.

However, as time dragged on, and as the boats stopped coming, Bill had to amend his thought. Ron, Ginny, and Draco would be leaving the school by this route if they were leaving at all.

His mum and dad showed up a bit later, desperately searching through the students for their youngest two, but Ron and Ginny simply weren't there. Bill waited at the dock, willing for another boat to come, as if by sheer will power along the more ships would arrive.

It worked.

He had been straining across the lake for what seemed like hours when he saw the first boat.

"There's more!" Bill yelled over to the Aurors. Immediately the parents that hadn't found their children were rushing over to the docks, shoving slightly, trying to see if their child was safe.

The first boat held three younger students, as did the second.

The third held Hermione Granger and little Laney Chalmers-Malfoy. A Muggle woman rushed forward to grab her, and Bill could tell, by the almost-black hair that it was Laney's mother.

"Laney," the young woman half-sobbed. "Sweetie, are you alright? Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine," said Laney, holding tightly to her mother. "Uncle Draco got me out."

Samantha looked up at the lake. "Where is your Uncle, baby?"

Bill looked too, spotting the next boat, and felt his heart leap with relief, and also worry, when he spotted his little sister's red-hair and not Draco's white-blond locks. Ron was still missing as well, and Harry.

Bill helped Ginny unload Blaise Zabini, who was more than unsteady, and barely lucid. The medi-witches took the boy and then Ginny was grabbing tight to Bill and he held her as well, barely registering the words she was saying.

"Wait. What?" he asked.

"They took Draco," said Ginny again. "He was right behind us, but they got to him and they Port-keyed him away. We have to find him. They'll kill him!"

Bill felt ice fingers wrap around his heart and he gently pulled away from his sister. "Mum and Dad are looking for you in the tents," he said. "Go find them, would you?"

Ginny wouldn't let him leave, latching onto his arms. "We have to get Draco out. He refused the Dark Lord and Tom hates to be denied. He'll kill him."

For the first time since the Chamber of Secrets, Bill saw true fear in his sister's eyes, and so he pulled her away from the crowd and spoke softly.

"Voldemort can't kill Draco, not yet. Draco was working on something, a translation that Voldemort needs and so he is indispensable. He will live, for now."

Ginny searched his gaze and saw that he was serious. She nodded, but her face was still pale and worry caused her forehead to furrow. She tucked a few pieces of hair behind her ear.

"I'll go find Mum and Dad."

Bill watched his sister leave and then rushed to find Dumbledore.

The Headmaster was just arriving with the lead Aurors with Harry in tow who was limping on an obviously broken leg. The medi-witches immediately carried Harry off and Dumbledore turned to Bill.

"Did Draco-," the Headmaster started, but Bill shook his head.

"Ginny saw him get taken. Laney's here, but Draco didn't make it."

The Headmaster looked grave and he reached out to clasp Bill's shoulder. "Ron is still missing as well. I'm sorry."

Bill nodded, swallowing hard.

"Harry said that by the time he got to the library, everyone was gone. Minerva has been taken along with, what initial reports say, seven children in total."

"How did this happen?" asked Bill. "I know they had the cloak of Merlin, but it shouldn't have happened so quickly."

"As far as we have been able to tell a Death Eater got in and then rigged three separate fireplaces to receive Death Eaters. They were also much greater in number than we expected."

"Do we have any idea where the Death Eaters went?"

Dumbledore shook his head. "Only the inner circle know."

Bill shook his head. Ron, Draco, Minerva, seven other children…

"Once the Aurors clear the castle, I want you to get Draco's things. If you could finish the translations we will at least know what it is Draco is translating and what the Death Eaters will find out. Perhaps we will be able to form a plan then."

Bill nodded, running a hand through his hair. The Headmaster moved off to speak with some more Aurors and Bill headed back to the tents. He would check on Laney for Draco.

The castle wasn't cleared for another hour, and once it was, Bill headed straight to the Gryffindor Tower to get Laney's cat for her. She really was a sweet girl, and it was evident she was terrified for Draco.

Bill then stopped by the Head's room and gathered up all of Draco's books.

After the happy reunion of Laney and Merlin, Bill settled in a back corner of the Three Broomsticks and pulled out the parchments Draco had documented his translations on. They were all written in perfect calligraphy, but Bill could spot the paragraphs that Draco had written when he was exhausted as the lettering slanted right ever-so-slightly.

The pages were perfectly in order, as the kid was obsessively organized when it came to any sort of academic work. Bill read over the pages, committing the fourth dialect to memory and then the third. He had started on the second when a plate was set in front of him.

He looked up to see his wife standing beside him, her bulging stomach a tribute to the child she carried. They didn't know if it was a boy or girl yet as they wanted it to be surprised. She was due in six weeks.

"How are you?" she asked, leaning forward for a kiss. Bill happily obliged and then pulled her onto his lap. "I'll squish you," she laughed, but then she settled back and Bill let his hands drift to her belly where he could feel the baby kick.

"Ron's gone missing," said Bill.

Fleur stayed silent. Bill knew she must be aware of that, after all, she had come to see him, but she let him talk.

"Draco's gone too and Voldemort isn't going to be pleased with him."

"I thought you made Draco a Port-key."

"I did, but if there are other students with him, he may try to get all of them out."

"I thought Slytherins didn't do that sort of thing."

"They don't, and he wouldn't, at least, not normally, but I don't think Draco would just leave them there. He didn't join the Dark Lord in the first place because he didn't want to murder children, and he's smart, so he'll think he can pull it off."

"You're worried."

"I am. I'm worried that Ron's brash attitude is going to get him killed and that Draco's arrogance is going to get him hurt."

Fleur didn't offer any advice, instead she covered his hands with her own and they sat together in silence for a few moments. Fleur got up after a bit and gave him a kiss. "I'm off to go see how your mother is doing. Do eat something, alright?"

Bill nodded and Fleur left.

Bill did eat a little bit, but he was mostly concerned with figuring out what Voldemort wanted. He was interrupted again, but this time by a commotion in the front of the restaurant.

Bill got up, trying to see what was going on, but there was a crowd around the fireplace and then the Aurors were there, shoving all of the customers back.

Bill was tall, and he wore dragon-scale boots with a slight heel – they were riding boots – and so he was just able to make out the forms of a few small children running out the Floo, but then the Aurors had completely blocked his view.

"What's happened?" he asked a man next to him.

"Something about those missing children escaping," said the man, "but I don't know anything else."

Bill felt a surge of hope. Could Draco really have gotten all of them back already?

The Floo died out, and the Aurors rushed the students away, but Bill couldn't see who had come back and the crowd was jostling again, trying to get out the door.

By the time Bill managed to leave the restaurant, the Aurors had gotten the kids into a closed off tent, most likely to check them over and take their story. By now, all of the parents who had missing children were around the tent, holding hands, and the villagers were also present, trying to hear more.

One Auror finally stepped out. "Could I please have the parents of Amy Caldwell, Janiene French, Sarah Perkings, Ben Roster, Anna and David Sutherfield, Ronald Weasley and Katerina Wuthers come this way please?"

There were some sobs, a few 'is s/he alright?'s, and then the parents were ushered into the tent. Bill waited with the others, nervously shifting back and forth, trying to figure out if the names called were a good or bad sign.

It seemed to take forever before the first couple came back out again.

"She's alright," the mother sobbed to the world. "All of them are out."

Bill could scarcely hope to believe that and then other parents were returning as well, including Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, but they were not celebrating. Bill's mother saw him and crossed over, holding her hand out and trying to push back tears.

"What happened?" asked Bill, grabbing her hand and holding onto it tight, seeking for the comfort that only mothers can give.

"Ron's been hurt," said his mother, her voice trembling slightly. "He and the other students used a Portkey to get out, but from what I understand the Portkey only took them to the edge of the estate, and they had to run for a town, but the Death Eaters pursued. The other children said that Ron and Professor McGonagall got them to a Floo, but Ron was hit by a curse, and…," Mrs. Weasley took a breath, "it's a dark curse, and he's awake right now, but they don't know for how long. There was also evidence that he had been put under the Cruciatus."

His little brother was hurt? No, not Ron. Ron had always been the active one, always the loud, sometimes oblivious one. He couldn't be – no.

"Listen, Mum," said Bill, knowing that his words sounded callous, but Draco was like a brother as well, and so he had to ask. "Did they say anything about Draco Malfoy?"

His mother frowned, no doubt wondering what had possessed him to be asking about the son of a Death Eater when his little brother was hurt so badly. She opened her mouth, most likely to rebuke him lightly, but then a medi-witch approached.

"Excuse me, are you Bill Weasley?"

"Yes," said Bill, "what is it?"

"Your brother is asking for you. He said it's important and we can't get him to settle. We really need to take him into surgery but he won't calm down until he speaks with you."

Bill nodded, ignoring the questioning look from his parents and following the medi-witch into the tent.

He passed my Minerva McGonagall on the way, who was also being checked over by a medi-witch and she was also talking with an Auror. Bill picked up a little of the conversation.

"-held at the Malfoy Estate, in the dungeons…"

Ron was lying on a cot, obviously in pain. His face was ashen and drenched in sweat and he was coughing up blood. Bill was immediately at Ron's side, the attending Healer stepping back to allow some privacy.

"Ron, it's Bill. What's the matter?"

Ron opened his eyes, but it was apparent the small movement cost him precious energy.

"It's Malfoy," he said.

Bill leaned forward. "What about Draco?"

"He said to tell you-," Ron broke off, coughing again and blood splattering from his lips.

"Ron, take it easy," said Bill.

The Healer looked over. "I really need to get him into surgery now."

"No!" gasped Ron, looking panicked at the thought. "The other part of the ritual involves coins, from Quintus Flavius. Malfoy needs you to get the exhibit out of the museum, all the coins gone except for one; you have to leave one."

Bill frowned. What on earth?

Ron continued, his voice growing hoarse. "And the Aurors need to be at the veil in four nights. The coin and the Aurors, that's what he said. You have to remember that, alright?"

"Did Draco make it out?"

Ron jerked his head to the side in a negative answer. "Said something about getting the Death Eaters together and the biggest blow to Voldemort's army since Harry was born."

Ron spasmed and Bill leaned forward.

"Ron, you okay?"

Ron reached out and Bill took his hand, looking down as something was pressed into his palm.

"You have to remember that, alright? One coin, four nights, one coin…," Ron trailed off and his body seized again, and this time it didn't stop. His eyes rolled back in his head.

"Ron!"

The Healers were there then, pushing Bill aside and whisking Ron away to the Hogwarts infirmary where the surgeon was waiting. Bill turned to watch them go, and then made his way out of the tents. The night sky had finally cleared and the moon was shining down, adding to the light of the torches planted around the perimeter of the tents, giving the Aurors and Healers light to work by.

He held up the object Ron had given him, an ivory charm on a black leather strap, and then he clenched it in his fist, staring up at the stars.

"Damn it, Draco…"

Again, sorry about the wait, and the next chapter will be up on Tuesday like usual. Please review!





20. Deadlines and Dead Time

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would sleep more. A lot more.

Author'snote: Umm, yeah. I know I promised to get the next chapter up last Tuesday, however, that was before I attempted to write the chapter. Please note the word 'attempted' as it is important. This chapter would not flipping write itself! I sat down multiple times to type, and each time I ended up deleting the entire thing I had written. And I'm still not happy with it, but it's as good as it's gonna get. So, please enjoy the next installment.

TheUnknown Factor: To the non-Slytherin mind it would appear to be quite Gryffindorish, however, Draco really wants to plot this ambush on the Dark Lord. He really could have gotten out with the others, but he chose to stay back. Thanks for the review!

R2D2: LOL!

Silvera: Ack, I'm sorry. I've probably caused you a nervous breakdown because you had to wait two weeks, and this one doesn't end any better really. I'm sorry.

Lilith: Wait, so that's permission to stalk you? Cool. Not that I am, a stalker, that is…yeah. Anyways, yes, I love your reviews, you (and Spyrit) always make me laugh. Sorry about the long wait, but glad to hear that Draco's animagi form was a hit. Thanks!

JoyCedar: Ah, another reviewer commenting on how they like Tuesday updates and I failed (throws self on knees and begs forgiveness). But thanks for reviewing!

Anna: Yes, other people will be making appearances, but more so later on after the conflict is resolved, and definitely more in the third story. Thanks for reviewing!

Sabireru: Do you still love me after I made you wait for two weeks for the next update?

Wingsand Claws: Glad that you liked it and thanks for leaving a review!

Freyalyn: Hope that you made it through the long week and I'm afraid these next few chapters will be (hopefully) intense as Draco is in the presence of the Dark Lord. Thanks for reviewing!

Sakuya: Crap! I missed your birthday! Wow, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you: Give me two characters that you like in the Harry Potter series and I'll write a little drabble and dedicate it to you. How's that?

Silkeknuts: I know you said you couldn't wait for the next chapter, and then I made you wait. I'm sorry. Did you manage to hold on?

Sanjs: Yes! The goal of every fanfic writer is to make life bearable…if only in weekly increments of seventeen pages each (which is my average chapter length). Here's a chapter for your work day…

Jo: Aww! I love you too. Glad that you're liking the story so much!

Aims: Thank you so much! I love to write, and the HP universe really makes almost anything possible, and I have a bunch more ideas lined up for stories. I just don't know if I have time to write them all.

Conngirl: Hey, don't sweat about managing to review. I couldn't manage to update last week, so I understand. Glad to hear that you are enjoying the story though, and here's the next chapter.

Wingsof Shadows: Yeah, stupid writer's block. Awfully sorry about the wait and thanks so much for reviewing.

MikosGirl: Yay, I get snaps! Thanks for reviewing, and I'm glad that you like my work. They are a tad lengthy though, aren't they?

Spyrit: Yay! You're back. Now I can update…alright, so the wait wasn't really intentional, but still, I'm glad that you've read the chapters, and yes, kissing Draco's pain away is def a nice thought! As for Wormtail's magic, I never thought of it that way until you wrote that. Huh, maybe you and Lilith are rubbing off on me subconsciously….

Draco woke slowly, the throbbing in his head and the searing pain in his left arm muddling his thoughts and obstructing his fight back into reality. He pushed through the darkness, trying to orient himself, but he couldn't quite manage to open his eyes.

He was lying facedown on a hard, cold floor. It was silent around him, and the smell wasn't familiar, meaning that he probably wasn't in the Malfoy Estate anymore. It made sense. If the students had escaped successfully then no doubt Ron or McGonagall had informed the Aurors that they had been held at his old home.

Draco managed to shift on the floor, prying open his eyes. He saw a stretch of worn stone floor, finally meeting a stone wall. The stones matched, and by the amount of scratches on the surface, and by the chill and dampness in the air, he was in the basement, or dungeon, of another old building.

"Awake, Draco?"

He flipped himself over, scrambling to his feet as his eyes landed on a blonde woman sitting composedly on a wooden chair. His eyes went from the woman to the rest of the room. There was a wooden table in front of the woman and also a thick wood door with a small barred window. This was obviously a cell.

He looked the woman over, taking in the clinging, short black robes and the loose blonde curls and the bright red lipstick. He met the woman's gaze with a sardonic raise of his eyebrow.

"Miss Jameson. How nice to see you outside of the classroom setting. I find such vocations really detract from the true character of the employee. I never would have supposed you to be a professor of blood purity."

She smiled, a flirtatious, seductive smile since she was no longer hiding her personality.

"Oh, come now, Draco. Don't play coy. I know it was you that ran into the room right as I portkeyed your favorite professor away."

"I honestly have no clue to what you are talking about. My favorite professor is Snape."

Claire laughed and got up, slinking towards him. "I've figured you out, Dray-co. You and Bill spent quite some time together last year when he was 'tutoring' you. Do you know what else you did last year? You saved his little sister from a dark ghoul. Not exactly high on the Slytherin's priority list, now is it?"

Draco shrugged. "I was hoping he would give me extra credit for saving the brat."

"Please. I've had months to think this over in Azkaban. You never really trusted me, did you? You were the one I could never quite win over and the nicer I got, the more suspicious you became. Why is that?"

"You're a whore," said Draco frankly. "I grew up with one. It's rather easy to spot your breed now."

"I suppose you mean your mother," said Claire. "Yes, that would make you wary, wouldn't it? But I fooled Dumbledore, and so when I was handing Bill the Portkey it shocked me to hear someone calling 'Oh, no Bill! Don't do it; she's a bad lady!'" She tossed her head and snorted. "I'll have you know, your voice grated on me everyday in prison, everyday wondering who had figured me out. When I was freed, I heard the news that you, Draco Malfoy, refused the Dark Lord, and suddenly it all made sense. You, who hung out with that sickeningly-good Weasley for the entire school year, would of course be influenced by his views. But still, denying the Dark Lord seems so…stupid."

Draco smirked. "Haven't you heard? I'm a genius."

"Oh," said Claire, waving her hand dismissively, "that. Do you know what I say to that? If you were a real genius, you still wouldn't be here, would you?"

Draco shrugged. "I got everyone else out, under the nose of a supposed god."

"They got out, alright," said Claire. "But not all of them are alive."

Draco felt a moment's fear, but he brushed it away. "Can't blame me for not trying," he said.

"Don't pretend you don't care. I know your just dying to know who it is. I won't hold the suspense because the punch line is too good." She smiled. "Ron Weasley got hit by a rather nasty curse on his way through the Floo. They don't think he's going to make it."

Draco felt real fear for one of the few times in his life. If Ron was truly hurt, then Draco's whole plan was thrown off. He would be stuck with the Death Eaters until a rescue, or until he got himself out, and neither plan had very good odds. There was another implication though. He, through his last-minute escape plan, may have been the cause of death for the youngest Weasley boy.

His mask was up, and he was sure that no emotion made it through, but Claire laughed anyways, stepping right in front of him.

"Don't tell me you don't care," she whispered huskily. "The brother of Bill, dead because of your plan. Do you really think that Bill's going to want to be your friend anymore?"

"Who said we were friends in the first place?" asked Draco, stepping back from the former student teacher.

"You were sending letters to each other, Draco, and not just ones that contained information to the Ministry. I know because I read them." Claire stepped forward, and Draco once again stepped backwards, but his back hit the wall and Claire grinned.

"Does this really bother you that much?" she asked, pressing forward so that she was flush against him.

"No," said Draco.

"Then do you keep turning away from me?"

"So I can do this." Draco brought his heel down on the instep of her foot and struck out with his elbow, catching her across the nose. She stumbled backward and he hastened her fall with a kick to her side. She lay stunned on the floor, her broken nose gushing blood, and he quickly searched her for her wand, finding it in a side pocket.

It was good enough for him to use, and he managed to get the door unlocked within moments. He then cast a silencing charm to avoid any sirens when he left the cell and to prevent Claire from yelling for help, and locked the door behind him. He looked down both sides of the hall and settled on running for the left door.

He jerked it open to find one Death Eater guard, who he took out immediately, but when the Death Eater hit the floor, a small sphere fell out of his pocket and smashed. A splitting alarm sounded and Draco swore.

He could hear shouts coming from just up ahead so he turned around and ran back through the hall with his cell, passing it and a few like it and then turning left when the corridor hit another.

He could hear shouts behind him now and he silently cursed, barging through a door and nearly tripping down a long flight of stairs. He managed to regain his balance, but it didn't really matter. Six Death Eaters stood at the bottom of the staircase, and even before he realized they were there, a curse was already headed his way.

The curse, a simple tripping hex, hit his legs and he pitched forward. He tumbled down the stone steps, trying to stop himself as he fell with his feet, but his momentum was too great and he felt something snap in his right ankle and then he was careening down the steps again.

He hit the bottom hard, finally coming to rest on his side and he merely lay there for a few moments, too stunned to move. His ribs ached, and from the feel of them he had bruised his right side rather badly. His shoulders were complaining as well, a sharp sting where he had most likely scarped a few layers of skin off of them. There had been a few steps where he had just slid straight down and his shoulders had gotten the brunt of those. He had jarred his left arm again, and the wound was once again sending burning pain to his head and he believed he had broken his right ankle.

He pushed himself into a sitting position and winced, then looked up at the Death Eaters who were staring back down at him, their cruel expressions telling him exactly how much they had enjoyed that.

But through that entire spill Draco had managed to hold onto the wand and so he lashed out. He was angry and in pain and those, added to his already impressive innate power, meant that the shockwave curse he sent out was tremendous.

The six Death Eaters were slammed backwards, propelled into the air by an invisible force. The same force blew chunks out of the wall, scattering the debris across the corridor and raising a cloud of smoke. When the dust finally cleared away, the Death Eaters were lying at the end of the hall in a tangled heap and Draco forced himself to his feet, leaning against the wall for support.

"Idiots," he muttered.

He made no move to run after that; he knew it was futile in his position, besides, he felt the tingle on the back of his neck which meant someone was watching him. He turned to see the Dark Lord silently descending the stairs. By his side was Claire Jameson, who had obviously been attended to as her face bore no mark of Draco's elbow. Behind her was another train of Death Eaters.

"It appeared to be a genuine attempt at escape, milord," said Claire.

The Dark Lord nodded, stopping on the last step of the stairway, gazing at Draco with a superior sort of smile.

"So, he really was trying to escape when we caught him the last time. He really doesn't have a plan for staying with us."

"Or it could be that I saw through your little test," said Draco, trying to support a little of his weight on his right foot but his ankle flared up. Most definitely broken. "Only a fool would leave one defenseless guard in a room with a dangerous prisoner to gloat about victory, and I, realizing that you are many things, but not a fool, could have realized that you were indeed searching me out for any plans that would be detrimental to your cause. Because of this, I could have decided to try an escape anyway, just for show."

Truth be told, it had been a little bit of both. He didn't want to stick around if there weren't going to be Aurors to get him out at the Veil, but if there were Aurors there, he needed to make it look like he didn't have a plan.

He smirked up at the Dark Lord and Voldemort glared, waving his wand. Draco was flattened against the wall, unable to pull away from the stone as if he was magnetized to it. Voldemort ripped the wand from his fingers and held it out to Claire who took it with a half bow.

The Dark Lord never took his eyes off of Draco, and he could feel the first brushes of Legilimency. His mental shields were already up, but he reinforced them just as Voldemort clamped down.

Someone groaned with the effort, though whether it was himself or the Dark Lord, Draco didn't know. He closed his eyes, only focusing on keeping the walls intact. When the first wall gave way, Voldemort came across another, and another, until the Dark Lord finally realized that he had been making no progress at all, but that each wall had been pushing him farther and farther away.

There was a scream of rage, and then a crushing blow. Draco could feel his mental shields groaning and straining under the pressure. The next great blow dented the metal.

He sucked in a bracing breath.

The next blow fell, but the walls were already gone. There was a white floor and a white ceiling, stretching for miles, as far as the eyes could see, and he stood in the middle, waiting the approaching figure of the Dark Lord.

Voldemort was confused, gazing about him in ill-concealed frustration. Draco smirked.

"Welcome to my mind."

Voldemort withdrew from Draco's mind with a snap that was practically tangible and Draco opened his eyes to find himself still against the wall, and Voldemort was right in front of him, red eyes boring into his grey ones.

"Take consolation in your small victory, if you can. I assure you, you will not hold that wall for long, and your secrets will be mine. For now, I will be content with your translations." He turned to the Death Eaters and jerked his head.

The force holding Draco to the wall disappeared and he pitched forward, but two Death Eaters were there to catch him. Draco didn't bother to struggle, but let the men support his weight as he hobbled along, following the Dark Lord up two flights of stairs onto the first floor and down a hall. They entered a study, a nice study done in shades of pine and burgundy.

Draco was shoved into a chair, which he was grateful for as he didn't know how long he could stay standing. Claire came in as well, standing to the side of Draco and then more Death Eaters appeared, holding the trembling form of Lorenzo Holiday, looking worn and tired, much different from when Draco had seen him last, teaching the code breakers with Bill when the Ministry program had started. His thinning, grey hair was matted to his head and his face sported a few fading bruises. His complexion was grey and his face drawn. From the look of him and the bruises, Draco would say that he had been there ever since Claire had returned with the Curator's journals.

Lorenzo was shoved in the chair next to Draco and then the Dark Lord pulled open the curtains of the room. Morning sunshine streamed into the room, brightening the atmosphere, if that was at all possible with the wizarding world's largest mass-murderer standing in the beam of light. It struck Draco as funny, and he smirked.

"You have four days," said the Dark Lord, turning to face him.

"It may take five. I've explained this."

"It will take only four or I will start cutting limbs for your body."

"You cut any limbs from my body and I swear on the graves of my fathers that you will never get that translation. Go ahead. Murder infants in front of me and torture any girl you want, but you will not touch me again and regain that bit of your soul behind the Veil."

His voice was cold, deadly, and no one could doubt the truth in his words. Voldemort stiffened, his expression twisting into an ugly sneer.

"Four days," he hissed. "And you will explain every move you make to this sniveling excuse for a translator and also your late student teacher. If you try one time to fool me, or if they suspect that you are stalling for time, I will be only too happy to find one of your dear school friends and kill them slowly in front of you. No doubt they are safe for now, but they cannot hide with Dumbledore forever, so in mind of their future, don't toy with me."

"You can't expect me to translate and teach in four days," said Draco. "I'm a genius; I understand things they can't."

"Then make them," said the Dark Lord.

"In four days? And entire new set of runes?"

"I suggest you don't sleep then."

The Dark Lord was no fool. Just giving Draco free reign over the translations without anyone understanding what it was he was doing would give him too much power.

The Dark Lord leered and started for the door.

"I need a blood-replenishing potion, preferably a few of them, some bandages, and a pain reliever," said Draco. "Some disinfectant too."

The Dark Lord froze before turning around once more.

"You dare order me?" he demanded.

"You want your Horcrux in four days? I'm going to have to be able to concentrate, and right now I have a broken ankle, a concussion, and a bloody hole in my writing arm. Those aren't exactly conducive to attentiveness. I'm just stating the facts here."

The Dark Lord snarled and jerked his head at Claire, who nodded. She left with the rest and the door shut with a snap and then locked. Silence fell and Draco turned to Holiday.

"So," he said.

"Why you?" asked Holiday.

"Why do you think?" asked Draco.

"Your father is Lucius Malfoy."

"So I've heard."

"He's a Death Eater."

"And I'm not," said Draco. "Or did you miss that fact?"

There was quiet between them. Draco looked about the room. It was a large study and richly wealthy families. The insignia over the fireplace proved that it was indeed the Nott's home.

"How long have you been here?" asked Draco.

"Around a week," said Holiday. "They want me to translate the Persian Runes and I've been trying to tell them that it's impossible, but they aren't listening. They gave me some journals from that Curator who was killed by Death Eaters, but they aren't really a help."

"Have you been anywhere else besides this room?" asked Draco. "Do you know where the Death Eaters are stationed?"

Holiday looked at him as if he was insane and Draco mentally groaned. Holiday was too scared to be of any help.

The door reopened and Claire and two other Death Eaters came in. The Death Eaters were carrying journals, papers, quills and ink; Claire was carrying a medical bag.

"Trust me enough to patch you up?" she asked, smiling at him with a predatory grin.

"No," said Draco.

"I'm afraid you don't have a choice. The Dark Lord has made your personal health my problem, so roll up your sleeve and let's see what the matter is."

"The matter," said Draco, "is that he put a bloody knife through my left arm. I'm also left-handed, so you'll be writing for me."

"Don't count on it. Roll up your sleeve."

Draco clenched his jaw as he pulled his jacket and shirt sleeve up. When he was thinking and plotting and scheming, he could keep the pain in the back of his mind, but this made him realize that he had been through a lot this past twelve hours, and he was stuck for four more days with the Death Eaters. It would be a miracle if he made it to the fourth night, and he would need to be functioning on a rather high level if he wanted his plan to work. And then of course, if the Aurors hadn't been warned, Draco was going to have to get out on his own, and he didn't want to think about how complicated that was going to be.

His arm was still leaking blood and the flesh around it was pink and hot to the touch. It was becoming infected.

Claire smeared a green gel over the wound with a cotton swab and the gel eased the burn as well as fighting the infection. She re-wrapped his arm and then gave him two blood-replenishing potions to drink.

"What else?" she said.

"Broke my ankle."

She gave him another roll of bandage and a pain reliever. "You can do that yourself."

Draco was not complaining; he did not like the former student teacher near him. He wrapped his ankle as best he could, thanking Merlin that it appeared to be just a hairline fracture and not something that needed to be set. He then downed the pain reliever.

"Well, genius boy," said Claire, gesturing to the table, "get to work. We're right behind you."

Draco pulled over the journals, skimming over the beginnings of the translations before tossing them aside. He set the Persian Runes beside him and began to write out the fifth dialect from memory, clinching his jaw as the motion aggravated the pain in his arm.

"I first translated when we know as the fifth dialect," he explained, "because that was actually the first. This passage in The Averne is written in what we think of as the second dialect and we need to translate that as well as the title. The title is important because the beginning of the chapters tell us what is needed for the ritual to pull the Horcrux from the Veil, while the chapter itself speaks of the chant to be performed and all the particulars. I was working on translating in hopes to get the Horcrux out without the Dark Lord, and managed to get the fourth dialect translated already."

He finished writing and then pushed the paper over. "This is the fifth, or the first dialect. To understand the second, you first need to learn that one. Look over that and let me know when you get it. I'll be working on the third dialect until then as time is of the essence."

He didn't wait for their assent, but started translating, or pretending to. He knew what he had done the first time he had translated the runes, and so he would just follow that pattern and make it look like he was thinking intently.

Inwardly he was trying to figure out the odds that the Aurors would actually be at the Ministry when he needed them to be there. He didn't doubt that Ron had been hit by a curse; there was no lie in her expression when Claire had told him so. The only question was whether or not Ron was conscious when he arrived in Hogsmeade. If he had been, then there was a good chance Bill had been told. Even if Ron hadn't managed to tell Bill, he could have passed on the information to McGonagall, although Draco didn't know if the teacher would have taken it as seriously.

He sighed, shifted, and frowned when something bumped his leg. There was a weight in his pocket that he was just becoming aware of and he discreetly reached under the table into his pocket, nearly starting with surprise when his hand closed around the hilt of the knife he had put there after getting the students out of the jail cell in the Malfoy home.

But the knife hadn't fit completely inside of his pocket, so why was it smaller now? It had shrunken nearly by half. And why hadn't the Death Eaters seen it on him and removed it?

He pulled his hand back out of his pocket and patted the outline of the knife on his thigh. He could definitely feel it through the school trousers, so shouldn't the Death Eaters also have felt it?

He glanced down, only to get another surprise. There was no evidence that there was anything in his pocket just from looking at his trousers. The black cloth was not stretched over the blade or hilt or anything. It was as if the pocket was indeed empty.

Before Claire got suspicious he turned his eyes back on his paper and began to write again, slowly because of his arm, mulling the knife over in his head. The fact that the blade had heated up meant that it was no ordinary dagger, probably a dark artifact. It was possible that the knife, because it had been used to mark him, had also been bound to him.

While Draco would have preferred having a wand, he was not going to complain. At this moment, any advantage was a blessing.

Draco went back to the runes, turning over possibilities in his mind. His best bet was to wait until they went to the Veil. If the Aurors were there, then Draco could commence with the ceremony and wait for the Aurors to make a move. If not, he would have to play it by ear, but he was relatively confident he could at least alert the Ministry guards and if he couldn't escape, he could at least leave a message for the Order to find.

Normally he disliked relying on anyone else, but in this case, he could make an exception.

Bill ran up the few steps of the main entrance at Hogwarts and the thestral-pulled carriage that had brought him to the school pulled away. Normally he would have Flooed straight over from the Museum, but the fireplaces were getting re-warded from the 'hacking' that the first Death Eater had done to get others inside the castle.

He pushed open the doors and strode through the halls, passing a few students who were waiting to be picked up by their parents, or had siblings in the infirmary still, but the majority of the students were gone. Hogwarts was officially closed, and would reopen after Christmas break, but not at its usual time. Because of the attack, the entire castle was going under renovation on the wards and magic surrounding the school. The students would be missing over three weeks of school before Christmas, and perhaps a week or so afterwards, so the school would be running late, through June, maybe even the first week of July if needed.

There were several Ministry officials in the halls as well and Bill greeted them with a nod as he passed. He then ran up the stairs, heading to the infirmary where Dumbledore probably was.

The infirmary held a few families, as many of the children who had been taken by the Death Eaters were held overnight for observation, but it was nearing mid-day and so the students were either gone or in the process of leaving, all except his family.

Bill crossed over to the collection of red-heads, giving his mother a hug.

"Where have you been?" she demanded, pulling away. She frowned at his appearance. "Have you even gone to bed?"

Bill gave her a wry smile. "Not yet," he said. "How's Ron?"

"Still in a coma. The doctors don't want to try to pull him out yet because they say his body needs time to heal a bit."

"They are going to try and wake him though, aren't they?"

"In two days, and if he doesn't wake up then, they'll give him another day."

"But what if he doesn't wake up then?" asked Bill.

"They'll keep trying until he does."

Bill nodded and his dad stepped forward, clasping his hand.

"Bill, how's Fleur? Did you see her back home?"

Bill flushed. "Ah, actually no." He had told Charlie to take her back.

"I took her back," said Charlie, coming forward as well. "Bill had to run off to do some translating for Dumbledore."

"Translating?" asked Mr. Weasley.

"It's, uh, actually confidential," said Bill. He was lying, but he really didn't want to have to explain to his parents right then because it would just lead to all sorts of questions, questions that would be answered by mentioning a certain white-blond, teenaged genius and Bill didn't know if Draco exactly wanted his secrets revealed to a family which didn't exactly get along with his own.

"Confidential?" asked his father, not believing him.

"It involved a Ministry operation," said Bill, "and I don't know exactly what has been cleared and what hasn't yet. Dumbledore will probably talk about it at the next meeting. Do you know where he is?"

"He's talking with Pomfrey right now," said Charlie, "about the best course of action for Ron. The doctors recommend leaving him here, because they don't want to move him, and so Dumbledore's making arrangements for him to stay here, perhaps even keep some of us in Hogwarts to keep him company."

Bill nodded and then left the group to get away from the faintly disapproving looks of his parents. He knew that they were just worried about him, because his last stint working for the Order hadn't exactly been ideal, but he still grew uncomfortable when his parents were at odds with him, even now that he was an adult. He had been up all night and was completely exhausted, so he sat down in one of the chairs next to Ginny who was reading one of her wizarding philosophy books.

"Pete Novick?" he asked.

"Marlin Brimley," said Ginny, not looking up. "It's his new book; it just came out two days ago. I pre-ordered a copy and it came in yesterday."

"You seem to be pretty far into it for just getting it."

"I haven't slept."

Bill frowned. "You okay?"

"It was an eventful night," said Ginny, still not looking up.

"It was."

"Blaise is doing better though, so that's good."

Bill didn't comment on the change of subject; Ginny always got around to the point eventual.

"He's down the row of beds and he'll be leaving tomorrow and Hermione was released this morning, but she's still with Harry who won't be able to leave until tomorrow. He didn't just break his leg; he spiral fractured it."

Bill still waited.

Ginny put down the book and looked at him.

"I saw Tom the other day," she said. "He was there when Draco was caught. He didn't go outside or anything, but he stood in the doorway. He recognized me."

"He recognized you?"

"Our gazes met," she said. "It was weird."

"Weird?"

"I'll let you know when I have a better word for it."

Bill thought for a moment before speaking again.

"How did seeing him make you feel?"

Ginny laughed, pulling up her book again. "That's a very therapist-like question. Honestly, it really was just weird. It threw me a little bit because I thought the next time I would see him would be on a battlefield or something, but that was it."

"So that wasn't what kept you up?" asked Bill.

"No."

"What was then?"

"It was a busy night," she said. "I was tensed and full of adrenaline, my best girl friend was knocked out by a spell that put her in the infirmary for the night, her boyfriend broke his leg badly, my brother was kidnapped, and then returned severely injured. Also Blaise, one of my best guy friends, got a concussion and I had to watch him bleed for ten minutes straight while trying to keep him awake in the boat so he wouldn't slip into unconsciousness all while making sure that Laney and Hermione's boat wasn't attacked by Death Eaters. And when they did try to capsize the boats, I had to use a dark spell to stop it."

"You used a dark spell?" asked Bill, not knowing how he felt about that.

"Yes, Draco showed me before he got caught. And you interrupted me, I wasn't finished."

"Oh," said Bill, "go on."

"Thanks. And then once we made it back to Hogsmeade I had to give my statement to three separate Aurors, and although they offered me tea, I hate tea and they had no decaf coffee, so I drank the regular coffee which really keeps me up. And then I had to reassure mum and dad and all of my over-protective worrying brothers that I was fine and the one brother I wanted to talk with disappeared and went who knows where for the entire night."

She stopped, taking a breath and releasing it before looking up at him.

"Feel better now?" asked Bill.

"A little," she said. "Yeah."

"Something still bugging you?"

She hesitated before shaking her head. "Yes, but you don't need to know."

"I don't need to know?" Bill asked.

"You'll just make a big deal of it, so no, you don't need to know."

"What if I promise not to make a big deal about it?"

"Remember when I went on my first date, and I only told you because you promised not to make a big deal about it? You proceeded to freak out and then you told mum and dad."

"That was two years ago."

"Exactly," said Ginny. She went back to her book.

"Wait," said Bill. "Does this have to do with a boy?"

She didn't answer; that meant yes. Bill wondered what boy she was interested in now, but because she obviously wasn't ready to talk about it, he didn't push.

"I'm glad you're alright," he said.

"You worry too much."

"Hey," said Bill, poking her side. "Who changed your nappies when you were young?" Who brushed your hair and put it into eight braids because it was you favorite number, huh? Who took you to your first Quidditch game because mum and dad said you were too young to go? I have a right to worry."

She laughed and then Bill looked up as Dumbledore and Pomfrey left her office. Bill patted Ginny on the head, like he did when she was younger, and then crossed over to the Headmaster. Poppy hurried off to make her rounds and Dumbledore and Bill found an empty corner to speak in.

"I contacted the Museum," said Bill. "The Curator, Henry Ables, is a friend of mine and he's having the coin display shipped to the German Museum. He also managed to date the shipping as occurring last week, just so no one will be able to tell that it was moved last minute. There's one coin left in the display as a show, along with a notice giving details of the display and that it's expected back next month."

"Good work," said Dumbledore.

"What did Kingsley say about having Aurors in the Ministry?"

"He's posting a guard every night until the Death Eaters show up. They'll be an actual ambush planned for the night Draco told Ron, but just in case something goes wrong, or the Death Eaters hold off a night, we'll know when they come."

Bill nodded, relieved to hear that.

"You look worried William. Draco is a smart boy; he will get through this."

"He'll get through it, but in what condition? When he got me out last spring, I….," Bill trailed off, shaking his head. "It's not something I would wish on anyone, especially not Draco, not when he's done, is still doing, so much. Besides, even with the ambush, even with all the best planning, something could still go wrong, and the knowledge that I have to wait another three days is unbearable."

"Snape believes that he will be called in soon, along with the Death Eaters who are not in the inner circle. He will be able to keep an eye on Draco. I've given Snape a Portkey to slip to Draco in case of an emergency."

"I gave Draco a Portkey," said Bill. "I even got his word, his promise, that he would use it if something went wrong."

"He did use it," said Dumbledore.

"What?" asked Bill.

"Draco is a Slytherin and Slytherins love technicalities. He did use the Portkey, to get the children back."

"But he said-,"

"But he never said he would use the Portkey personally, did he?" asked Dumbledore.

Bill blinked and then groaned, running his hands through his hair. "When he gets back," he told the Headmaster, "I am going to lock him in a room and leave him there until he forgets all of these crazy plans of his and decides to become a recluse that stays in his own house and comes up with mathematical theorems and the what not."

The Headmaster smiled. "Good luck to your endeavor then Bill."

Bill nodded and the Headmaster moved off to go speak to Minerva who was also still in the infirmary but in a farther corner to provide her some privacy. Bill sighed and leaned against the wall, but his thoughts were interrupted when his stomach growled. He needed to eat something and then go to bed.

"Hey," said Charlie, coming over, "I was going down to the Great Hall for some lunch. Want to come?"

"Most definitely," said Bill.

He pushed himself off the wall and they walked down to the Great Hall where there was a table full of food set buffet style. There were a few families eating there before they left, and a few Ministry workers were also on break.

Bill and Charlie served themselves and then found a place on the Hufflepuff table where there was no one around them and sat.

"You know," said Charlie, after a few moments of silence, "I can't help but think that you're not really telling us the entire story."

"The entire story?" asked Bill.

"It's reminding me of last year when you told us you were taking the job at Hogwarts, but you never really told us why. Then, we found out after you were hospitalized, that you were actually spying on Death Eaters. You aren't still spying, are you? I mean, you've got a wife and a kid on the way."

"I wasn't spying on Death Eaters," said Bill.

"Then where were you these past few months?"

Bill put down his fork and sat back. "Alright," he said, "but, I'm only telling you this because you can keep your mouth shut."

"It is one of my finer talents."

"I was in France, taking information from a spy on the streets and putting it into a code using Ancient Runes, or rather, the Persian Runes."

"The Persian Runes?" asked Charlie. "You translated them?"

"Not me," said Bill. "The student that helped me escape the Death Eaters last year did."

"I thought you said you couldn't remember how you escaped. Wait, a student?"

"Yeah. One of my students helped me escape the Dark Lord," said Bill. He paused, waiting for Charlie to come to the right conclusion. It took a few moments.

"No," said Charlie, put his fork down and staring at Bill. "No way."

"Yes," said Bill.

"No, that's…that's insane. What other students did you have in your class?"

"He was the only one with information about the Death Eaters. He was the only one that could have found me."

"But…DracoMalfoy?" Charlie asked in an incredulous whisper.

"You know I was tutoring him, right?"

"Yeah."

"Well, I wasn't. Not really. We were working on the Persian Runes, and we started talking. Nothing big at first, but he started to relax around me, and then the topic of Death Eaters and what not came up."

"This is insane," said Charlie.

"Don't I know it," said Bill. "It turns out Draco wasn't exactly sure of the whole idea of blood purity and all that. He's a smart kid, and so he saw the hypocrisy of having a Half-blood leading the cause, and he also felt that there was some moral wrong in killing children."

"But his father is Voldemort's right hand man."

"His father isn't around all that much though, and his mother, well, from what I've heard, she's pretty bad, so Draco was pretty much left to raise himself. He hates people telling him what to do, and so he isn't one to believe something just because everyone else does. He likes making his own decisions."

"And you helped him decide that being a Death Eaters wasn't exactly a good career to choose?"

"Yeah," said Bill. "Pretty much."

"And in return he rescued you from Voldemort?"

"Yeah."

"And then he translated the Persian Runes?"

"Yeah."

Charlie shook his head. "What is he? Some kind of wizarding genius?"

Bill smiled and Charlie stared.

"You're serious," he said.

"That's why Voldemort went after him," said Bill. "We think that Bellatrix Lestrange was wearing the necklace that held Voldemort's Horcrux and when she and Sirius were fighting, Sirius grabbed it when he fell through the Veil. The chain must have broken, and so Sirius took it through with him. The instructions on how to work the Veil are written in a dialect of the Persian Runes so Voldemort grabbed Draco."

"But how did he know that Draco could translate the Persian Runes?"

"Because after I coded the information my contact gave me, I sent the letters to Draco to translate them. My safe house was breached, and they found a few of the letters Draco and I exchanged."

Charlie shook his head again. "Never in a million years would I have suspected that. That is, without a doubt, the wildest story I have ever heard."

"So, now you know why I can't really tell anyone. It's not exactly my story to be telling in the first place. Besides, I doubt Draco would really appreciate me spilling his every secret, especially because he isn't part of the Order because he doesn't really get along with everyone."

"Yeah, I can see that as being somewhat upsetting," said Charlie. "When everyone else does find out though, I promise to act surprised."

Bill smiled. "I'm holding you to that," he said.

Again, sorry about the wait. And I will try very hard to get the next chapter up Tuesday, but, no promises, seeing how well I held up my last promise, but I shall make every effort to get back to Tuesday updating. Please leave a review!





21. Musings before Fate's Doorstep

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, which sucks, because if I did, I'm sure I could sell this as a spin-off series. Wouldn't that be cool?

Author's note: So, at the end of the chapter, I sorta went on a tangent about Fate. Why? Because I had to find a filler for the second half, and Bill's piece wasn't long enough, but I couldn't start the Veil/ritual/does-Draco-escape part until next chapter, otherwise I would have half of it in, and half not. So, instead I have different characters musing about Fate, and the activities leading up to the ritual and ambush because I wanted to try something new. Let me know if it worked for you, or not.

Sabireru: Yup, Charlie's the dragon one. I've always liked him too. Thanks for reviewing, and glad you liked it, but I can't tell you about Ron, because then I'd give it away. Sorry.

Silke Knuts: Wow, you're in Belgium? That's really cool. How's the weather over there? Thanks for reviewing!

RekkaKouyuu: Draco will be fine fake translating, just getting out will prove to be the problem. Thanks for reviewing!

Ciri: Lucius does have redeeming qualities, but don't get your hopes up because, well, he isn't exactly redeemable, sorry. But he does have an integral part to play. Thanks for the review!

Anti-muppetmadness: Thank you so much! I'm glad that you liked AtW, though I go back and read it now and I cringe at my typos and what not, but what can you expect as a first fic, right? And glad to provide you pleasure on your camping trip. I'm not much for camping, but I think a good dose of Draco would make any experience better. Thanks again!

Anon: Glad to see that you found my other stories! I think the Code is my favorite to write, so I'm happy you liked them too, esp. seeing as it took me so long to update on the others. Thanks for reviewing!

R2D2: I made your blood pressure go up? Cool, although maybe I should start disclaiming on that as well, lol. Thanks!

Bena24: I think it was because I had so much trouble writing it, that no matter what I did, I wasn't going to like it, even if it did turn out okay. Thanks!

Conngirl89: I'm sorry about college and your phone, but you know what, I got wait listed on the one college I wanted to go to as well, and it sucked, but things all worked out because I met a bunch of amazing people here. Things will work out for you too. Thanks for reviewing!

Spyrit: Rest easy. Charlie's not a spy. He's just Bill's confidant because Bill needs someone he can talk to, and they are closest in age. As for Bill being called 'William', yeah, I figured it was something Dumbledore would do. And don't learn the art of short reviews, it is the one masterpiece that is the bane of the fic writer's existence. As always, thanks.

Anna: Well, here's the set up for the brilliant Draco-plan, and we'll see the results next week. Hope you like it!

Sakuya: I'll put your one-shot up! You can get to it on my profile. Thanks for reviewing!

Drewberry: Here it is! Thanks so much!

Sanjs: Lol, Ron and Draco drunk together. That would either be lethal, or really funny. Thanks!

Lilith: Yeah, I always figured Charlie and Bill to be confidants with each other, and Bill needs to be able to tell someone, I think. And the set up is all in this chapter, the action in the next, and no, haven't brainwashed me, sorry. Thanks!

Draco stared at the wall in front of him from where he sat not three feet from the pine green wallpaper covered in parchments. He tilted his head to the side, making a show of trying to figure out the Runes.

"Have it yet?" asked a bored voice behind him.

"I'm thinking."

"You've been staring at the wall for half an hour now."

Draco continued to run his eyes over the runes. This one section, trying to translate over into the second dialect, had taken him awhile and so he was playing it up.

"Hey, genius boy!"

"Still thinking."

"You're not thinking; you're glazing. You don't need another wakefulness potion, do you?"

"Do you realize how many of those I've had in the past three and a half days?" asked Draco.

"I care why?"

"Eight," he said. "Do you know what that does to a body? It wears it out. A few more and I could have a stroke, or a heart attack, at the age of seventeen."

"Real tragic, I'm sure."

"Go screw the Dark Lord."

"Go suck off Dumbledore."

"That's the Order's job."

Claire snorted and then walked forward. "What are you even trying to do?"

"Trying to bore a hole through the wall by focusing my mind's energy on one spot."

"Very funny."

"Not as funny as the people who believe you can actually do it."

"Seriously, what part are you on? I don't want to keep the Dark Lord waiting. Scratch that, you don't want to keep the Dark Lord waiting."

"Maybe I like the suspense."

"Maybe you like being tortured."

"I thought you were the one that was into blood-play."

Claire laughed, but didn't deny it. "You know, you're not half bad, Dray-co."

"Over forty-eight hours without sleep causes one to feel and behave as if they were drunk, although, I have had the wakefulness potions, which would counter that, but not by a lot. I think with the wakefulness inducers it might take seventy two hours. Either way, I'm drunk off no sleep."

"I bet you're a blast to have at the parties." Her tone was dry, teasing. It was amazing what spending three and a half days locked in the same room could do to people. Then again, Draco was also extremely sleep deprived, seeing as he had been awake ever since his second escape attempt. Exhaustion meant he wasn't quite as cold and aloof as he usually was. Claire got to take breaks, so Draco couldn't attribute her friendliness to that, but he had a feeling when she wasn't trying to seduce someone, she was just genuinely…friendly. Friendly wasn't the right word, but he couldn't quite think of the right synonym.

"Don't like parties all that much," he said, "although, when I was in the States, I attended a math conference and they had a banquet-type thing afterwards. That was fun. I got to discuss advanced mathematical theories with Muggle professors who spend their life studying that stuff."

"I take it back," said Claire.

Draco smirked and leaned back in his chair. "I see it," he said.

"See what?"

"The connection between adverbs and adjectives. Do you see it?"

"Do I look like a genius?"

"You look like a prostitute," said Draco. Today she was wearing a blood red dress, not even an attempt at robes, and it was worse than something Pansy would wear. "Is the Dark Lord ever going to take your hints?"

"They're not even hints anymore," said Claire. "They're outright suggestions."

"Is that a little kinky though? Trying to nail a mass-murderer who is more than twice your age in a newly rejuvenated, but yet still warped, body?"

Claire shrugged. "Maybe a little, but I can't help it. He's so…inspiring."

"Expiring, maybe," said Draco.

"Is he just not attracted to you?"

"I think he's just oblivious."

"I thought he was supposed to know everything."

"You're a genius, right?"

"Yeah," said Draco.

"Do you understand women?"

"I see your point, but he's supposed to be a god."

"He is, but his power is diminished without the other pieces of his soul."

"And you want me to get the Horcrux out of the Veil so you can shag the Dark Lord."

"It would be nice," said Claire.

Draco laughed. "You have to go back to the fifth on this one."

"What?"

He pointed to the runes on the wall. "Back to the fifth, or the first translation to get the connection."

Claire squinted at the papers. "Oh!" she said.

"There you go," said Draco.

"So that's it? We're done?"

"Well, now we actually have to translate the chapter and title, but yeah, on the homestretch."

Draco got up and used the chair to help him hop back to the table. He sat down and picked up a quill.

"Don't take this the wrong way, or anything," said Claire, "but I actually might be sorry to see you die."

Draco snorted. "I'm not going to die," he said.

"Well, when the Dark Lord is through with you-,"

"He's not going to be through with me," said Draco. "Do you know what else I am capable of?"

"No, what?" asked Claire.

"I'm working on a counter to Veritaserum," said Draco. "Do you really think he would throw that away?"

"Oh," said Claire. "Well…good."

"Don't take this the wrong way or anything," said Draco, "but when I finally get away from this place, if you're in my way, I might have to kill you."

"What?"

Draco shrugged. "It's nothing personal; just try to stay out of my way."

"You don't honestly think you can get out of here, do you?" asked Claire.

"Dunno," said Draco. He frowned when he heard his words slur and tried again. "Don't know. Shit, that wasn't even a complete sentence."

Claire laughed. "You really are drunk, aren't you?"

"Maybe," said Draco. "Get those pages off the wall for me, will you?"

"Why can't you?"

"I have a broken ankle."

"And you're my prisoner."

"Oh, yeah," said Draco. He pushed the chair back and made his way over to the wall. In addition to hobbling, he was also swaying, and he nearly toppled over, but then Claire was there to catch him.

"Whoa," she said. "You obviously can't hold your liquor."

"Never could," said Draco.

She helped him back into his chair and he had to bite back laughter.

"What's so funny?" she asked.

Draco shrugged. "Dunno," he said, then shook his head. "I don't know." He may have over articulated those words so that they came out properly. "I didn't think being held hostage by the Dark Lord would be this funny."

"You think this is funny?" asked Claire.

"Right now, everything is funny."

"Then why aren't you laughing more?"

"Malfoys don't laugh," he said seriously.

"That sucks," said Claire.

"Yeah, a little bit," he allowed. He looked over at Holiday who was slumped over the table, fast asleep. "Why does he get to sleep?"

"Because he drove you insane, remember?"

"Oh, yeah," he said. The man had objected to every step Draco had taken, insisted that his way was correct, and then had sniveled and cringed every time Claire threatened to get the Dark Lord.

Draco picked up the quill and started writing out the translation. This part of the job took two hours, because he hadn't had the chance to translate the chapter before this, and so he really was doing actual work on absolutely no sleep.

"There," he said, pushing the paper away from him. "I'm done."

Claire took the page from him. "How come it is that you still have really nice handwriting, even when you're half asleep?"

Draco shrugged and yawned. "Force of habit?" he asked.

"You need another wakefulness-inducer?"

"I need to sleep," he said. He knew that, if he was forced to take wakefulness inducers until the night, when the Death Eaters would attempt the break in, he would have no chance of escape if the Aurors weren't there, and even if they were, he still had to get out of the line of fire. He couldn't do that in his current position.

Claire studied him. "You look like hell."

"Thank you."

"So this is the ritual then?"

"Seems pretty ordinary. We'll need candles, water, a blood offering - just a goblet full - and an ancient coin. We'll also need to teach your friends some chants, which may be difficult for them when we take into account their mental capacity, but it's relatively straight forward."

The door opened and Voldemort strode in.

"Well?" he demanded.

"I'm done," said Draco. He blinked, trying to clear his vision again. "Do you want me to read it out loud, or do you think you can handle it by yourself?"

The Dark Lord turned red eyes on him, the thin, bloodless lips turning into a leer.

"Crucio," he said calmly.

Draco had not been expecting that. Maybe if he had been on top of his game, or if he had taken the anti-sleep aid, he would have realized that talking back to the Dark Lord, after he had just given the Dark Lord what he wanted, wasn't a good idea.

The curse took hold of his body and he jerked out of the chair, the scream leaving his lips, but only for a moment. Then his jaw was clenched and the scream was broken off, leaving him writhing on the floor.

The Dark Lord removed the curse, crossing to the table. Holiday had woken up and was pressed back in his chair, trying to move away as Voldemort picked up the pages.

"You are sure of this?" he asked Claire.

She shrugged, expansively, so that her chest, barely constrained by the tiny dress, rose and fell. She wasn't wearing a bra.

"I understand the basis of translation, but I'll have to check that over before we know for sure."

Voldemort turned to Holiday, but was still speaking to Claire.

"He was asleep." It was an accusation.

"He wasn't doing anything but whining and objecting. It was…extremely trying."

"He was of no help then?"

Draco's eyes widened, turning to Claire and shaking his head frantically. She saw his expression and merely smiled. She was, even after all of their banter, a Death Eater. He had forgotten.

"No."

"Avada Kedavra."

Holiday was dead before he fully realized what was happening and his body fell limp next to Draco, cloudy blue eyes staring straight at him.

Draco scrambled to his feet, or rather his foot, and managed to stumble a few steps back from the body. The Dark Lord turned on him, waving his wand, and he was smashed against the wall, sliding up until his feet could no longer touch the floor and he was hanging from the curse alone.

"So, you have outlived your usefulness," said Voldemort, coming forward.

Draco hated the pasty skin that no doubt felt as cold and clammy as it looked and for one moment he wondered why on earth a woman as good looking as Claire wanted him. He shook the thought off.

"Usefulness?" he asked. "I'm a bloody genius."

Voldemort stepped closer and even though Draco was off the floor, the Dark Lord was still taller than him. It was imposing. A long, pale hand reached out and clamped around his neck. Slight pressure was added.

"I'm not interested in what you can do," he said. "For me, the knowledge that I have ridden the Order of their greatest weapon is enough. I want you to know, before you die, that I will take great pleasure from this."

So, he was smarter than Draco gave him credit for. Draco was sure that the Dark Lord would want to exploit his mind, use him to give him the advantage. The Dark Lord obviously realized that trying to hold onto a genius was more trouble than it was worth, and killing him before he had the chance to escape for the Order was the only way to ensure that he couldn't tip the balance.

"You can't kill me now," said Draco. "What if I translated the parchment wrong?"

"Oh, I won't kill you until after Claire has checked over your work. I just wanted you to have time to dwell on your demise. This is what those who deny the Dark Lord have to expect. You will be an example to the rest."

"You can't kill me even after that."

The fingers tightened, the nails digging into his neck.

"Explain," said Voldemort.

"There are also additional instructions for the ritual written on the stone surrounding the Veil. Those are placements to where people need to stand, and where things should be placed. That isn't in the book, and so it's something that needs to be figured out right then in the Ministry. I've translated these runes, so I can read them, fluently. Claire could translate those runes, but it would take her a while, maybe a few days. You don't have that time. You need to get in the Ministry and out again as quickly as possible. So go ahead and kill me. The Aurors will just find you."

The Dark Lord's face warped through different emotions before settling on a grudging acceptance, but the hand around his neck tightened, cutting off his air.

"You shall live until I have retrieved my Horcrux. I will leave your body in the Ministry for your pathetic Order to find it, but when they do, they will not be able to recognize you without an identity charm. That is a promise I give to you."

Draco was released and the Dark Lord stepped back, watching as Draco crumpled to the ground.

"Well?" Voldemort demanded of Claire.

"The title is correct," she said. "The code, that the journals speak of, says 'The Descent/ Submersion an easy path. No doors bar the road, but Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life is not easily returned/retraced. The Road not by water, so diverged by men. A Mantle/Veil of water woven to mark the way. Descend/Submerge only for Death. Life may be saved, but only with a prayer, an offering, and the Payment of the Crossing.'"

"Payment of Crossing?" the Dark Lord asked.

"A coin," said Draco, pushing himself to a sitting position, leaning against the wall. He let his head drop back against the wall and closed his eyes. "The payment of crossing is the myth that upon death a soul must pay the boatman to be ferried across the river." He opened his eyes to look at the Dark Lord. "You need a coin to get your Horcrux back again. Look in the museum for coins during the reign of Quintus Flavius. That was when the myth was begun, and so that's the coin you need. Everything else is just in the chapter, and it's a pretty normal ritual."

The Dark Lord turned to Claire who nodded. "It checks out."

"Good. When I return, I will have the rest of the translation verified."

He left and two Death Eaters entered to drag Lorenzo Holiday's body out, and then the door was shut.

"The sofa looks comfortable," said Claire.

Draco looked up at her and she shrugged. "I can check the translation out myself and you aren't going to be any good at reading the runes in the Ministry if you don't get some sleep."

Draco nodded and pushed himself up. He hobbled over to the sofa along the back wall and collapsed. He was asleep within moments.

He was immediately awake when the door opened again, but he kept his eyes shut, being able to tell, from the state of absolute exhaustion he was in, that he had managed a two hour nap.

"Do you have it?" asked Claire.

"Yes. What of the rest of the translation?"

"He did it correctly, no hidden warnings or intentions of a booby trap."

Interesting choice of words, Draco thought, catching the stress on 'booby trap'.

"Why is he asleep?"

"I figured he needed to be capable of functioning once we break into the Ministry. We might not have a lot of time to do the ritual and so he needs to be able to translate quickly. Even the wakefulness-inducers weren't keeping him lucid for an hour."

There was silence and then the sound of footsteps heading towards him. He had to stop himself from tensing and then a hand was jerking him up and throwing him to the floor. He grunted when he hit, his eyes springing open but not focusing, as if he had just woken up. He tried to scramble backwards, but a foot was placed on his chest and then there was a presence in his mind.

He let the thoughts of the last few days filter through his mind, as if he was still trying to grasp hold of what exactly was going even as the presence tried delving deeper. Draco let one thought resonate through his head before he pulled up his shields. Claire in a blood red dress saying she wasn't just giving hints that she wanted the Dark Lord, but actual suggestions.

He pulled back, acting as if he was completely awake now, and although there was pressure on his mental shields, the Dark Lord could not get in. He stared at Voldemort, calming his breathing and reinforcing the walls.

The Dark Lord stared at him for a moment before turning around. He walked right out the door before stopping and turning slightly. His red eyes met Claire's and he jerked his head. She followed him out the door and Draco heard it lock. He pulled himself back up on the couch and lay down. Tonight was the night that could make or break the war. It was also the night when his fate was determined and if he had a choice, seventeen was too young to die.

It would be tonight, at the Veil, that if there was such thing as Fate, it would be made know. Draco was inclined to believe that every person was responsible for his/her own actions. Fate was nothing more than a scapegoat to be blamed when things went wrong, and a name to give to coincidence that could not be explained.

Still, it was a strange irony that it would all take place at the Veil, the supposed entrance to the world beyond where Fate made her home.

Claire knew that some people would find lusting after a resurrected body deranged and revolting, but she was not merely lusting after the body. It was the Dark Lord's mind, his power, his lack of inhibitions that was so…well, no doubt Draco could name it. All she knew was that every time the red eyes turned her way, she felt a shiver of fear, pleasure, and longing run through her core.

The Dark Lord was more than a man; he was a god. He held life and death in his hands. If his morals were corrupt, if his cause unjust, who was to be the one to judge him? Who had power over this man who had believed so deeply in purity he had split his soul, divided his essence, and he was still so much more than the world could hold. If there was an authority to stop this god-man, than they would have to beat him, to destroy him, and who, in this island nation, or even in this world, was brave enough, strong enough, to stand against a god who held the devotion of an army. This was why his followers feared him; feared him and loved him.

To love a god was expected; to be loved by a god, or even noticed, was unexpected.

When Claire stepped out of the classroom she was ready to fall instep behind the one she had chosen to follow; she was not ready to find herself face-to-face with those red eyes that made her tremble, that made her knees grow weak and her breath catch.

The Dark Lord took one step forward, and then another, and then she was backed against the wall and the thin, bloodless lips that she had watched for so long were on hers. It was not gentle; she didn't want it to be.

And then, a few hours before night, Claire got up, knowing that she was favored by a god, and that kept her euphoric, even when, thinking back on the time they had spent alone together, the Dark Lord had only taken, and she had never received, and so she was left feeling drained and spent. But the knowledge that she had been accepted by a god, no, by Voldemort, was enough. The hex she had received was painful, but it had served its lesson. It was 'Voldemort', not 'Thomas'.

She wasn't to know that the last person to call her god 'Thomas' had been a little red-haired girl with hazel eyes, who had read a diary; read the diary, because, without reading the book in its entirety, the soul of Thomas Riddle would not have been released. A diary is intimate, and reading it gives certain liberties that not even the chosen followers can hope to obtain.

But she felt her heart swell with the knowledge that she was favored and so when she went to wake the white-blond boy that could have chosen to be a god himself, she went with a smile, and with the intention to wait as long as possible before waking the boy. She would let him sleep because he needed it. A god has the authority to bestow blessing on his followers; the favored of a god could do the same, as long as the god did not know.

Tonight her god would regain another part of his soul, and Fate was smiling down on them, she knew it must be. After all, the ritual was to take place on the very steps of Fate's doorway. Fate had signed her name to these blessings.

Bill pulled his hair back into a braid, fastening the end tightly and then pulling out his earring. He knew that tonight could be messy, and he didn't want the fang catching and tearing straight through his earlobe.

He reached for the dragon leather jacket Charlie had given him, just for this occasion. The dragon hide was somewhat resistant to dark magic, and every little bit counted. He grabbed his wand and pocketed it. He stared at himself in the mirror and took a breath. He said a prayer, not for himself, but for a white-blond boy who was tempting fate at this very moment.

He left the bathroom and walked down the stairs to the kitchen. Fleur was there, sitting at the table with a cup of tea in front of her. Her hands were not around the mug, but around her round belly that held his child. She looked calm, but her hair was too perfectly swept back and her make-up was of a calming color scheme, pale blues and greens on her eyes, posy pink on her lips. She never wore this much make-up normally; she was one of those people that had to apply their brave face.

Charlie was sitting across from her, having been the one that made the tea.

Bill leaned down to give her a kiss which she returned, but without real passion. She instead wrapped his arms around her stomach and held his hands there.

"My child will not be born without a father. You will be careful, yes?"

"I promise," said Bill. "I'm not to be in the real fight. I'm just getting Draco out."

"Still, our son needs his father."

"And what if it's a girl?"

She smiled. "Our son or daughter needs a father. Come back to me."

"I promise," said Bill.

She kissed him this time, and Bill was loathed to pull away. When he did his brother was there to pull him into a hug.

"Get the kid, that's it," he said.

"That's it," Bill agreed. "Nothing more."

"You're a good man to do this."

"He's a good kid. He's already done this."

Charlie conceded the point with a smile. "Go get him then."

Bill nodded and threw Floo on the fireplace. "The Department of Mysteries."

He stepped through to the other side where Aurors were already gathering.

Kingsley greeted him with a firm handshake. "Do you want to see it?" he asked.

Bill nodded and was taken into a large room. As soon as they stepped inside the doors around them began spinning at a dizzying speed before finally slowing and stopping. Bill looked about at the doors in wonder.

"Which one is it?" he asked.

"That's our security precaution," said Kingsley. "It will respond to any authorized voice. Mors cella."

The door second to the left swung open and Bill stepped through. The room was circular, sloping downwards and lined with stone benches. There was a large clearing in the center, also in a circle. In the middle of it stood a stone arch. A tattered cloth hung from the stone and Bill swore it was flapping slightly even though the room was still.

"That's it?" he asked. For some reason, he had thought there would be…more.

"The Veil," said Kingsley.

Bill watched it, wondering what it would be like, just to step through, to stick an arm through. Would the Underworld claim that as well? Would he be able to pull it out, or would it be stuck? Would he be sucked through, into whatever world it was down there, crowded with displaced souls and ruled by Fate?

"Understated," said Kingsley. "That's what it is."

Bill could only nod his head in agreement. He followed Kingsley back out into the atrium. The Aurors were already hiding themselves behind invisibility cloaks or in other rooms. There were monitoring spheres set up, some right inside the Veil room so that the Aurors could always be aware of what was happening, ready to step in at a second's notice.

"You'll be in here with me," said Kingsley, opening the door to a small security office that had been transformed for this purpose. The windows from the outside showed that the office was closed after hours, but from the inside, they had a perfect view of the lobby.

Bill glanced at the clock. It was only seven. It was unlikely that Voldemort would come in at anytime before eleven, and probably not until after midnight. Still, he was tensed and his stomach was in knots.

It seemed fitting that such an operation would be taking place in the same room as the Veil, in the same room as the entrance to the Underworld, a realm ruled by the Fates. Bill wondered if Good really was to triumph over Evil like all of the fairytales told. If so, he had no doubt that tonight would be a success, just like the night a little over a year ago when they had managed to capture most of the Death Eaters, thought they had lost Sirius in the process.

Part of him wanted to believe in those fairytales again, but he was guarded. Fate was said to be just, and he had heard stories where Fate was cruel. If Fate existed, then he would say Fate was cruel to the white-blond boy that would becoming in later that night, and it was cruel to a certain black haired boy with a scar as well.

Perhaps, then, humans were really left to create their own fate, or was that destiny? Was there a difference?

Either way, tonight would show what sort of stuff Fate was made of.

The liquor cabinet was open again, but this time the poison of choice was whiskey. Rich, strong, numbing.

Tonight his son might die, and he would watch it happen; he would not intervene.

Yes, Draco had chosen, and he had not chosen his family, or his heritage. That came with costs and consequences, and Lucius had never stood in the way before, and he wouldn't now. Still, the whiskey was poured into the glass as the clock struck nearer to nine.

The Death Eater army was amassing, waiting for tonight when their great leader would become even more powerful. Tonight would either clench the Death Eater victory or it would show that the Order did indeed have a chance.

Lucius was no fool. His son would not have stayed, would not have sent off the Portkey without him, had he not had some reason to stay. The escape attempt just proved that.

Had Draco really been left behind, and had he truly wanted to get out, he would have killed Claire in the cell, killed Claire and then transformed bodies. True, without Polyjuice the likeness would have been crude, but it would have been enough to throw the Death Eater guards off long enough to make it to where he could find an alternate means of escape.

The Dark Lord was many things. Overconfident was on the top of that list.

Then, of course, there was the fact that only one coin had been found in the museum. The sign read that the coins had been taken to Germany, and that they had been sent a week ago. That time marker proved to the Dark Lord and the Death Eaters that it was just coincidence, and so they had taken the one coin left without another thought. They only needed one, after all. Lucius had been the only one that had checked with the German museum. The display had arrived only yesterday and the delay had been attributed to a mistake in shipping.

Such a display of valuable coins would not have been casually, mistakenly shipped to the wrong address. Lucius knew because he used the same shipping company and he had yet to learn of a shipping error.

Was it mere coincidence then that the coins the Dark Lord needed were gone? Or that the German museum had received the coins only yesterday? Almost as if the coins had been shipped two days ago, and not a week like the sign read? Two days ago, the prisoners had escaped and one could have carried a message back to Dumbledore. Was it coincidence that his son was translating runes, and had given the Dark Lord the time frame when he would be done? To ensure that the Death Eaters were at the Ministry at a set time?

Lucius sipped the whiskey and stared at the fire. His heritage demanded that he inform the Dark Lord, that he be the one to cast the curse on his son that would end his life. Another part of him, the part that Lucius did not name because doing so would just affirm that fact that it was real, told him to let Draco go. To let him go and to then systematically murder every bastard that had dared to lay a hand on him. Lastly, he would kill the Dark Lord, slowly, by sticking a knife into very limb of his body and then burning the skin from his bones.

He would do neither. Fate and destiny had never collided more than they had this night. Destiny held that Lucius would forever be the right hand man of Voldemort and though Fate's game had yet to be revealed, Lucius was sure it had to do with his son living, to his son surviving.

Lukas had been born because Lucius had been taken with an older girl in Hogwarts, a girl that had gladly given birth to his first son, and Lukas had been a pleasing child, but the girl and her family had raised him. Lucius was content with Lukas, who was intelligent and charismatic, but Draco was his. Draco was supposed to have been born, to be the heir, to carry on the Malfoy name. He had done much more than that. Lucius was not expecting to…care for his son, even more so than Lukas.

Had Draco been the one married to a Muggle woman, and had he been the one to be struck down by Lucius' mother, Lucius would have not only poisoned his mother, he would have sent her away, in disgrace. He would have struck her name from every account and locked her in with the Muggles. He would have then raised Draco's child as his own, Half-blood or not.

And this was Draco, not Lukas, that was no doubt planning an ambush tonight.

And so Lucius would not intervene. He would let Fate play her hand, a hand that was, no doubt, influenced greatly by Draco himself. Fate was swayed by human choice that was the difference between Fate and Destiny. Fate could be seen, the workings and hints and vague foreshadowing just before it struck. Destiny was suspected, was hypothesized, was believed in, but never concrete until the soul had moved on.

It was fitting that tonight they would be found at the altar of Fate.

The red-haired girl glanced up when the clock struck out the first blow of twelve. Mid-night. She wondered if the attack was happening now as Tom loved the dramatic, no, Thomas did. He thought of himself as Thomas; that was what he called himself in his inner thoughts, and she would know. She had been privy to those thoughts.

She glanced over at the still bed of her brother. Still in a coma.

She looked about the room at her family, sleeping in the chairs, or trying to. She was not. She had been reading, but now, she was keeping a vigil. Only a few people knew what was happening right now. She was one of them, if only because she had listened in on conversations and had bugged for the smallest of details until she put together the details.

She listened as the last chime faded out and then shifted, making herself comfortable in her chair. Bill would come back in the early hours of the morning, and he would be with Draco or he wouldn't. Those were the two outcomes.

She hoped for the former, prayed for the former.

Fate was out there, looking over it all; she knew it was.

People made choices, and people lived their own lives to their own beliefs, but there was something greater, something more. There had to be a greater power because no other explanation made sense. Why else were there flowers in the summer? Why was there snow in winter?

No person could claim responsibility for those, nor could any person claim responsibility for the first breath of life, nor could it be explained, but one thing could be known.

There was a struggle going on, a great struggle, night versus day, dark versus light, summer versus winter, Good versus Evil. It was displayed in earth, in sky, in man. Night and day warred for its time in the sky, always locked in a cycle of winning, only to lose again. For every lantern that is lit, a dark corner exists, and for every dark place made bright, a shadow is created. For every beautiful summer, there is a hard winter. For every act of love, an act of hate.

Ginny knew, without any doubt, that Fate was no cruel mistress, nor did Fate belong with the dark. She also knew that good would win in the end. She had her proof. There were the stars to beat the night, people made love in the dark, in the winter there was sledding and snowmen. More people were being born than were dying, and even in death, there was peace and hope.

So she prayed to Fate, because Fate was good, and Good would win in the end, just like light and day and summer had. It was that hope which had kept her alive when reading the dark and terrible thoughts of one Thomas Riddle; it was that belief that allowed her to accept the small bit of dark, that little bit of blackest ink, that had transferred onto her mind from the pages of the diary.

It made her feel better, knowing that the conflict would take place right at Fate's front door. She knew that Fate was not restricted by distance, or even by time, but the idea of Fate being physically present was reassuring. The Veil was Fate's home; She was there.

There was one who could answer all those questions of Fate and of Destiny, and of human choice and the prevailing nature of Good or Evil, but he was not able to articulate it, nor could he even hear the questions. He was, after all, only with Fate, not Fate herself.

He was with others, and there was a real knowledge of self here, but no way to measure time, or even to know if time was passing, and so he might have been there an eternity or a day and he wouldn't know the difference.

Fate knew. She knew how long he had been there by the number of thoughts he had considered, by the number of breaths he had taken (had he needed to take them), and by what mortals call years and days. He had been there over a year. Almost a year and a half.

Once he left Fate's temple, he would not be able to tell those he knew of Fate, and of her existence (or lack of it), because it would be forgotten and it was for the best. Could there really be physical proof? Proof would mean truth, and not belief. Fate must be belief if it is anything at all.

It was time for him to leave, and he would be granted re-entry into the real world because of a certain white-blond boy who was currently in the process of being woken up so that he could travel here, to get the soul out. There was no question that he would succeed; the question that the mortals would ask was 'why?' Was it a predetermined course, or did each and every single choice he, and those around him, had made lead him to this one Veil on this one night?

And so objects are sent in motion, on paths that could be predetermined if one believes Fate has deemed it so, or on paths that have been directed by the individual. Can they only be seen after they have occurred, or were they set in stone from the beginning of earth? Is every choice possible and Fate merely a reassuring idea, or does the reassurance come from a source other than human thought and creation?

Either way, the events of tonight are happening right at the Veil, at the point of belief or disbelief, at an altar or at an arch. It is fitting.

By the way, 'mors cella' is literally 'death room' in crude Latin.

Another note, I put up a one-shot dedicated to my reviewer Sakuya who's birthday I missed. As requested, it's a Draco and Harry one-shot, but not slash, just the obligatory 'suicidal-feeling Harry' one-shot that all HP writers have to write at some point in their careers. Check it out, and let me know what you think.

Review if you're excited for the next chapter.





22. The Ritual and Rescue

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, but I do own over one thousand reviews. Amazing. I'm shocked and pleased and feeling very loved. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

R2D2: I'm glad you like my Lucius. It's fun to write him.

Natalie: Thanks!

Silkeknuts: Dank u. I hope that's right. Is that thank you in Dutch? I find people who speak more than one language, like you, to be amazing. And you're only thirteen? That's incredible. Thanks for the review!

JessicaTan: Thank you very much! And I'm glad you like how I portray Lucius because I definitely thought there is more to him than just a bad, snobbish aristocrat.

Anna: Well, I could tell you about Ron, but then it wouldn't be a surprise…lol. Thanks!

Spyrit: I'm glad you liked the fate bit. It's funny, some people were like 'meh, didn't really work for me' and some people were like 'omg! I love it', so it was cool to see those responses. Personally, I think those people who liked it are more philosophically minded. And I'm glad you like sneaky Ginny too, I think it makes her much more interesting. As for seeing Draco drunk, well…ugh, I can't tell you, because then I would ruin the ending. But just wait! Thanks again!

Lilith: I'm sorry you were scared by Claire/Voldemort, but I was exploring the different areas of her psyche. She wants to be special, to be chosen, and who better to give it to her than a 'god'? It also explains why she is with the DE's in the first place and, as Spyrit suggested, she probably was lacking a strong male presence in her life. And on another note, you know Bill and Fleur are perfect together, you know it! Ha. I brainwashed you (grins and bows). Thanks!

Shelimar: Well, Lucius does love power and blood purity, and even though he loves Draco too, he doesn't really love him more. As for helping him, well, read the chapter, cuz you're sorta right. Thanks!

Sanjs: Well, while Lucius' not doing anything is in essence doing something, in his mind, by staying out of it, he's just going to let things run their course (i.e. let Fate run its course) and this way he feels as if he hasn't betrayed his beliefs or his family, so it excuses him in a sense. Of course, you are right, everything is cause and effect, but there must be some higher power, some 'first being' that set about the change in the first place. That's what this is discussing. Thanks so much for your review.

Scorpioverde: It got better? Yay! That's what every author wants to hear. Thanks so much!

Mask: I'm not really comparing faith and belief, although I may have used them as synonyms. If that is the case, than I altered their definitions to compare Fate and Destiny, which are closely related, but subtle diff. And I can change defs, because philosophers do it all the time.

Lauren: Hey, thanks for reviewing, and yes, it was a filler, though it really does provide some insight to different characters. Thanks again!

A soft hand on his shoulder caused him to start awake and he opened his eyes to see Claire staring down at him looking quite pleased.

Draco groaned and sat up. "I take it he finally got the hint, then?"

"What did you tell him?"

"What?"

"After he read your mind he finally realized what I was after. What did you tell him?"

Draco shrugged. "Just let him see our conversation. I hope it wasn't disappointing?"

"That leads me to another question. Why did you do that?"

Draco smirked. "Marius Apollo."

"The Italian wizarding dictator in the thirteen hundreds. What does he have to do with it?"

"He was notorious for his severe punishments and was accountable for the destruction of entire villages because of one citizen's disobedience. What history class hasn't told you is that he was married later in his life, to a renowned prostitute in fact, and his harsh punishments were curtailed."

"You aren't seriously hoping that I curtail the Dark Lord, are you?"

Draco shrugged again. "At this point, it can't hurt to try. What time is it?"

"A little after twelve."

"Brilliant," said Draco, and then he yawned. Claire handed him a wakefulness-inducer which he gratefully gulped down.

The door was shoved open and then the Dark Lord was in the room, glaring at Claire who was kneeling beside Draco. Claire got up and went to stand by his side and then two Death Eaters had entered as well and grabbed Draco.

He was shoved to his knees in front of the Dark Lord and his arms jerked behind his back. Cold metal clamped around his wrists, one hand fastened under the other, and then he was hauled to his feet.

"It is time," said the Dark Lord.

Draco wondered, briefly, if the madman could be any more melodramatic, and then large hands grasped his upper arms in bruising grips and he was propelled forward. His right leg gave way when he put his weight on his ankle, which he was beginning to think was not broken with a simple hairline fracture, but the Death Eaters hardly noticed that he wasn't supporting his weight anymore and simply continued dragging him.

The other Death Eaters were amassed at the large fireplace, but Draco could tell from their numbers that only the inner circle and the Death Eaters that served as the Dark Lord's constant guard, the ones who made their homes wherever the Dark Lord went, were gathered there. None of the 'regular' Death Eaters were present, well besides Crabbe and Goyle seniors, who were holding Draco, and that meant that Snape was not among the army. Draco could have used his help. Draco concentrated on the weight of the knife in his pocket and fervently hoped that the Weasel had managed to tell Bill about the plan, or else there were a lot of unsolved problems he wouldn't get the chance to solve, at least, not in this life.

The fire was already burning in the grate and upon the Dark Lord's arrival the Death Eaters threw on Floo and started stepping through. There were twenty five in total and Draco could pick out the figure of Lucius Malfoy among them.

Then he was shoved forward with his two guards and appeared in the atrium of the Ministry of Magic. The floor was a new, as the old one had been badly damaged during the skirmish almost a year and a half ago between the Death Eaters and Potter's defense club. The fountain was also replaced, but it was identical to the original.

They passed through the atrium quickly, a guard of Death Eaters sweeping the room, but the Dark Lord didn't even pause, Claire at his side and Draco being propelled along behind them. Draco glanced around, trying to catch sight of a clue that would indicate that the Aurors were present, but he could see none and so he merely concentrated on keeping track of all the Death Eaters and any possible escape route.

The group of black-robed wizards made it to a room surrounded by doors, and as soon as the entire party had arrived, minus a few who would stand guard in the lobby, the walls began spinning, becoming no more than a blur before slowing and falling still once again.

"Find it," the Dark Lord commanded, and the Death Eaters each pulled open one of the doors.

"In here, milord," said one, gesturing to a door on the right.

Draco was prodded forward again, into a circular room holding stone benches on steps, leading down to a clearing where a stone arch stood, a tattered curtain hanging from the curve. It was blowing in an invisible wind.

The Death Eater guards dragged him down to the arch while the doors were warded shut behind them. Voldemort was circling the arch, his red eyes sweeping over the fragile-looking doorway.

"Don't trip," said Draco. "Would be a tragedy if you fell through."

Again, talking-back to the Dark Lord was not a smart idea. Draco blamed it on his lack of sleep, and also the realization that he could, very easily, die here.

The Dark Lord crossed over to him, grabbing hold of his neck and forcing him forwards before throwing him at the foot of the arch.

"Before this night is over," he hissed, "I will send you to the afterlife. But it will not be as easy as stepping through a curtain. You will beg, and plead, and scream for death before it finds you, and while you yell, I will tear out every thought you have in your head, every idea, every ability you possess, I will know of it, and I will use them to personally hunt down and destroy anyone you looked upon as a friend. I want you to know that, Dragon." The English form of his name was said in a mocking voice, but the words were chilling.

Draco clenched his jaw, his only thought at that moment was not to convey the very real fear he felt at the Dark Lord's threat. Voldemort, apparently, wanted to see that fear because he grasped Draco's head, turning it to his, red eyes boring into his skull.

Draco smirked.

The Dark Lord did more than glare, his red eyes seemed to spark, and then he hauled Draco up again.

"Direct the ritual," he said. "Know that it was you who is responsible for giving me twice the power I now possess."

He released Draco and stepped back, waving his wand and the manacles that were around his arms fell to the ground. Draco resisted the urge to rub his wrists and merely straightened his clothes, brushing off the dust, as if unaffected by the threats.

He walked around the Veil, studying the stone work, noticing the hieroglyphics that had been etched into the surface, but were now worn away. Of course his walking consisted of staggered steps and long pauses on his good foot, but he finally made it around. Now that he was beside the Veil, and now that most of the Death Eaters had fallen silent, he swore there were whispering voices coming from the Veil. He wondered if the voices were those who had never made it across the river, or if he could only hear the voices of the people that he knew who had passed on. He shook the notion off and checked the stone floor, brushing away the dust that had cumulated on the floor, uncovering a few other glyphs.

"This is the front," he said. "The candles go here, right by the arch, in the half-circle like in the translation, but with a path leading to the Veil. "The water will be poured just a little ways behind the two rows of candles, but only when I say so, got that?"

The Death Eaters nodded and Draco turned to Voldemort.

"Well?" he asked.

The Dark Lord joined him standing in front of the Veil, but back from the curtain, the candles placed between them and then arch. The Death Eaters formed a complete half-circle behind them, white masks turned up to the Veil.

Draco took a breath, steeling himself before nodding.

"Give me the coin," he said.

The Dark Lord handed him the ancient coin and Draco walked forward and then flicked the coin through the Veil. It didn't fall through to the floor on the other side but disappeared somewhere halfway in between.

"Light the candles," Draco said, returning to his position beside the Dark Lord.

Voldemort waved his wand and the flames shot up on the candles' wicks. No sooner had the small fires flickered to life, the Veil fluttered in a wind that was, all of a sudden, very real. The wind was cool, and clammy, and smelling faintly like the ocean, but there was a stench on the wind that spoke of decay. Draco could hear the whispers of the Death Eaters behind him, but he paid them no mind. He clenched his good hand, in an attempt to focus all of his anxiety on that one area, and spoke aloud.

"Ater novo lux. Frigus novo ferveo."

The chant was taken up by the Death Eaters behind him, and the wind increased, whipping around the room and whistling under the stone benches until the Death Eaters were screaming the chant to be heard above the wind.

Draco stared at the Veil, squinting his eyes because the wind was harsh and, unlike the others in the room, his eyes could not tear up to offer protection. There was one final gust that sent Draco back a step and caused a few Death Eaters to stumble, and then the flames on the candles shot into the air, over their heads and burning blue before the flames were extinguished and the smell of smoke overrode the odor of the wind.

"Now the water," said Draco.

Two Death Eaters stepped up, holding large silver pitchers in their hands. They poured out the water in a stream behind the candles, once again stopping from completing the half circle so there was a clear path from Draco and the Dark Lord to the Veil. They stepped back into place.

"Humus novo agua," said Draco. "Sitis novo repleo."

Again the Death Eaters took up the chant, and once again, the wind returned. This time the wind stirred up a small microburst that followed the line of water, sucking it up until the stone was dry and then the room fell silent.

"Now the blood," said Draco. "It has to be fresh."

"And you did say anyone's blood would do," said Voldemort.

"Yes," said Draco. He would have liked to say that the blood had to be Voldemort's, if only for the satisfaction of causing the Dark Lord some degree of discomfort, but Claire was smart, and she had looked over his translations, so he couldn't.

The Dark Lord nodded, and then a Death Eater had stepped forward, grasping him around his torso, pinning his right arm to his side, and stretching his left arm out. Another Death Eaters held a silver goblet underneath Draco's hand and handed the Dark Lord a knife. The glint in the red eyes told Draco just how much Voldemort was enjoying this, and Draco clenched his jaw. The blade slashed across his palm; Draco winced.

The cut was deep and blood poured forth, dark red spilling down his palm into the cup. It only took a few moments to fill, and then the Death Eaters let him go. Draco clenched his hand, trying to stop the flow of blood as best he could and the Dark Lord handed him the cup filled with his blood with an ironic, vindictive smile on his face.

"Call forth my soul, Draco."

Draco took one last look around, hoping he could see the red of the Auror's robes, or a glint of red hair, but the only color in the room was his battered green jacket and the cup full of his crimson blood. It contrasted greatly with the grey stone, the grey Veil, the black and white of the Death Eaters uniform. Now that he thought of it, Voldemort's eyes were red as well. The same color as the blood dripping down his hand and in the cup.

He jerked the goblet forward, splashing his blood onto the cleared path in front of the Veil.

"Sanguis novo viscus. Mortis novo vita."

The chanting echo was once again repeated, filling the room with the Latin words. The wind started, and then the candles burst back into flame and water began welling from the stone. The ground trembled and a white light shot from the Veil, and it was as if the light was an actual force because Draco was still chanting the words, and so were the Death Eaters behind him, but he was frozen in place, incapable of even leaning forward.

The wind and the water and the flame died out, and the ground no longer shook, but the light only gained in intensity. It radiated from the Veil, and it was bright, and it hurt to look at it, but Draco couldn't turn away. Behind him the chant died out and Draco was left whispering the last words.

"Novo spiritus Sirius Black."

There was a flash, accompanied by a crash of thunder that made Draco's heart jump and then a form was rolling out of the Veil.

It was a man with wild black hair and as naked as the day he was born. The figure tumbled to a rest, knocking over a few of the candles, and then the white light was slowly fading.

Draco forced himself to move, even though the motion was slow, as if he was underwater, pushing against constraints. He made it to the man's side and knelt down, reaching out and finding a pulse on the man's neck. The man was alive. Draco jerked back in shock when suddenly a hand was clenched around his wrist and Draco stared into the dark grey eyes of Sirius Black, who looked about just as startled as he did.

Then Dark Lord was there, forcing his way over as the light continued to die out. He hauled Sirius up, his gaze sweeping over him before tossing him to the side. He whirled on Draco who suddenly realized, now that the noise of the ritual had died out, and now that he had become accustomed to the silence, there was a faint thumping on the door to the Veil room.

"Where is it!" the Dark Lord demanded in a shriek of rage. He fisted his hand in Draco's shirt and pulled him close. "He doesn't have my Horcrux!"

The thumping grew louder, but the Death Eaters were too busy watching their master than they were listening for intruders. Draco smirked.

"Of course he doesn't have it," he said. "Did you really think I would give it to you?"

The backhand was powerful, snapping Draco's head to the side, and then he was flung backwards, into the waiting hands of two henchmen.

"And," said Draco, spitting blood out from his mouth, "you actually thought that I didn't have an escape plan, when in fact, you are about to find yourself surrounded by every Auror in London!"

The Dark Lord whirled to look up at the door that was in the process of being forced open and he growled, turning back to Draco.

"They will not be in time to rescue you," he said. "Goyle, the Portkey!"

Shit, they had a Portkey?

Draco knew that Apparition was impossible in the Ministry, to prevent attacks, but a well-constructed Portkey could break them out. He spun to right, jerking away from the two Death Eaters and pulled out the knife from his pocket. Immediately the dagger extended to its original length, and Draco ripped the sheath off. Goyle reached for him again, the Portkey in his hand, and Draco lashed out.

The knife was sharp, too sharp for an ordinary blade which meant it must be magically enhanced, and then Goyle dropped to the floor, his hand falling separately away from his body before disappearing as the Portkey took hold of it. The Death Eater screamed in pain, his voice echoed by the battle cry of the Aurors who managed to break open the door and come pouring through.

"You!" Voldemort seethed, rounding on Draco. He raised his wand and Draco stumbled back, trying to run. His ankle gave way and he dropped to the floor and so the curse Voldemort leveled at him soared past him. Draco stared as the evil green light flew over him.

The Avada hit the wall, blasting through the stone where there was another room. Draco scrambled to his feet, running again as Voldemort screamed in rage, and as curses flew around him. He pulled himself over the pile of debris in front of the gaping hole in the wall and pitched into a room filled with shelves upon shelves of crystal balls. He was in the Hall of Prophecy.

He stared for just a moment, that was all he needed to take the incredible sight in, and then he was stumbling for the far door. He could still hear the battle in the room next to him, and then louder voices, people stepping over the same pile of stone he had climbed over to escape.

He ducked behind a shelf, as hidden as he could be behind a wall of crystal spheres, watching as three Death Eaters made it into the relative safety of the room. The trio pulled off their masks and Draco froze when the face of his father appeared.

"Well, that didn't go as planned," said Lucius mildly. "I believe now is the time for our exit."

"I blame that boy of yours," said Rodolphus LeStrange bitterly, spitefully.

Lucius only looked amused. "Of course you do, and you would be correct to do so." He looked over as a particularly loud crash called his attention, and then returned his gaze to LeStrange and the other Death Eater, but in doing so, his gaze slid past Draco's half-hidden form.

Draco stared back, but the grey eyes did not linger on him, or even flicker in recognition. Had his father not seen him?

Lucius held out a key and the two laid a finger on it. Their forms began to blur and then Lucius looked straight at Draco, grey eyes cold and unreadable, but the gaze was not hard, merely a stare.

The three Death Eaters disappeared and then a curse ricocheted into the room, smashing into a shelf of glass and exploding. Draco turned and threw himself to the ground as glass shards whirled past him, some hitting his jacket and being deflected by the thick olive khaki, but some grazing the back of his neck and head.

Draco hit the floor with a jolt that reminded him that he did have cracked ribs not four days ago and they really hadn't healed, and then he was covering his head with his hands as the explosion died out.

He was on his feet, or foot, again in an instant, running for the door, but then it was flung open. Draco pulled up short, gripping his knife tighter before registering the red-hair and concerned hazel eyes. He could have laughed with relief right then.

The quick breath that left him right then may have been a short laugh, but then he was starting towards Bill, feeling that it was finally over. Bill met him halfway, running to him when he realized that Draco wasn't exactly capable of walking on his own.

Draco was not prepared for Bill to pull him into a tight hug, as if he was a brother that Bill thought was dead, but that did not mean that Draco didn't like it. He might have even returned it, although he chalked it up to exhaustion and a need for support than admitting he was glad that the Aurors had come and that Bill had come along for him.

He was then aware that Bill was berating him, even as he hugged him, and Draco snorted, pulling away from his former professor with a smirk that was more of a grimace. Bill looked somewhat chastised.

"Let's got you out of here," he said.

Draco sheathed the knife he held and then pocketed it as Bill pulled his right, uninjured arm over his shoulders and put his own arm across Draco's back. Draco leaned on Bill a little more than he would have liked, but he was tired, and hurt, and wanted to do nothing more than fall asleep for a good twelve hours. Maybe even more.

They made it to the entrance room, where the door to the atrium was propped open and Aurors standing guard at the doorway, preventing any Death Eaters from leaving. They were immediately escorting Draco and Bill through the room, blocking them from any stray spells, and then they were in the lobby and there were medi-witches taking Draco over to the side where a few injured Aurors were being examined as well.

"Can you tell me your name?" the Healer asked, already running a diagnostic spell.

"Draco Malfoy."

"Your age?"

"Seventeen."

"And can you tell me exactly what happened?"

Draco blinked and looked up at her, disbelief written on his face. He was sure he would have burst into laughter had not the room just then been over-run with Aurors returning from the Veil room with Death Eater prisoners, or helping wounded comrades. They had apparently won the fight and then Draco and Bill were joined by Kingsley Shacklebolt who gave Draco a nod.

"I trust you are well," he said, not really making it a question.

"I'm fine," Draco nodded, before catching himself with a grimace.

Bill snorted. "Fine? You look like hell."

Draco shrugged, then winced as the simple motion caused an ache throughout his body. "I'm still alive," he said.

"Let me be the judge of that," said the Healer, frowning as the spell ran over Draco's body. "I want to get you to St. Mungo's for a full exam."

"Hogwarts would be better," said Bill. "Safer."

The Healer nodded. "That would work as well. Here, take these and then you should go straight there."

Draco took the potions, a pain-reliever and a blood replenisher and then the Healer took his left hand to look at the cut on it, but the motion jarred the burn on his arm and Draco hissed, feeling sick at the pain. He had felt an infection set in during the past few days, but he couldn't do anything about it.

"What is it?" asked Bill.

Draco shook his head. "I'm fine," he said, but that just made the Healer push back his sleeve. Draco had to clench his teeth to not yell at the fire that motion caused and then Bill and Kingsley were recoiling at the wound, and even the Healer looked a little ill.

"Shit, Draco," said Bill. "Just…shit."

"Take him straight to Hogwarts," said the Healer. "Get that looked at. I can't even begin to treat that, not here."

Bill nodded, and then helped Draco to his feet.

"We'll have to Floo to Hogsmeade and take the carriages up because the Floo isn't running at Hogwarts yet. Think you can make it?"

"Yeah," said Draco, voice hitching as he put his right foot down too hard. "I'll be fine."

"You use that word too much," said Bill. "I think you've forgotten its original meaning."

Bill threw Floo on the fire, calling out the Hogsmeade-Hogwarts exit and then helped Draco through. They appeared at the train station where the Hogwarts express stopped and there was a line of carriages waiting for visitors even though it was the middle of the night.

The thestrals turned when Draco pulled himself in, collapsing more than sitting on the cushioned seat. No doubt they could smell his blood. Bill sat across from him and the carriage lurched forward and then began rolling at a steady pace. Draco caught Bill looking him over and he gave a tired smirk.

"Don't look so worried. You'll give yourself grey hair."

"Didn't you say that would be an improvement?"

"Point," said Draco.

He was suddenly completely drained, feeling the tension, fear, and pressure of the past four days, no, of the past two weeks, finally slip off of him. He found it was finally easy to draw a breath, and his mind could finally wander, but that also meant the adrenaline was no longer keeping him conscious. He fought back the urge to close his eyes.

"You looked surprised to see me," said Bill, calling his attention and Draco gratefully focused his mind on Bill's voice, fighting to stay awake.

"I didn't know if you were coming," he said. "Claire said something about your brother being hurt."

Bill nodded, looking grave. "He isn't waking up," he said, "but he gave me your message."

"S'pose I'll have to thank him," said Draco, and then he frowned. He was slurring his words again.

He shook his head as his mind went into a spiral, trying to clear it. Snippets of the past four days flashed into his vision, Claire and her dresses, Holiday being hit by the curse, the fight at the Veil, the green killing curse sailing over his head when it should have hit. His broken ankle had saved his life.

He laughed, but not in amusement. He had a feeling that this was one of those times people talked about where you could either laugh or cry, and he was unable to do the latter.

"Draco, you alright?"

Bill sounded concerned and Draco nodded, halting his laughter and pulling his expression into something a little saner.

"I'm fine," he said, but then he realized that he wasn't. His skin all of a sudden felt clammy and he had to gasp to pull in a breath. His mind was light-headed but clear all at the same time, and then he was detaching from reality.

The carriage jolted and he slipped forwards, but then Bill caught him, and Draco could see his mouth moving but his voice was muted and distorted.

"Going into shock," said Draco, and then he laughed again. After all of this, and he was going into shock now? He tried to push away the dark, but he had nothing to brace himself again. Bill was talking again, his expression intent, urgent, anxious.

From far away Draco felt hands pulling him up, keeping him from slipping as the carriage jerked again, seeming to accelerate, though Draco didn't know why. His gaze drifted and dimmed, finally fading into black, and then the noises stopped, and the pain stopped, and Draco slipped into unconsciousness.

Bill wondered if Draco knew just how badly beat up he looked. His hair was snarled but matted over his temple on one side, and the unusual white-blond strands were colored rust from dried blood. There were a few faded bruises on his face, one on his cheek, another under his eye, and his lip was split rather badly and just beginning to scab over. His hand was still bleeding from a cut, and his arm –

Bill didn't even want to think about the wound. It looked as if someone, most likely Voldemort, had stuck a hot poker straight through his arm. The wound was scabbed over with dried blood, burned, dead skin, and swollen flesh, that caused almost his entire lower arm to be discolored and distorted, but Bill did not doubt that at one time it would have been possible to look straight through Draco's arm. The idea was sickening and he spoke up to distract himself.

"You looked surprised to see me."

Draco blinked up at him, obviously being pulled from his thoughts, and the expression in his grey eyes, which were just barely guarded, was complete weariness. The kid was exhausted.

"I didn't know if you were coming. Claire said something about your brother being hurt."

Bill nodded, feeling that familiar tightness in his chest when he thought of his youngest brother. "He isn't waking up, but he gave me your message."

"S'pose I'll have to thank him," said Draco, and then he frowned, as if thinking about something that caused him some consternation. Bill frowned too. Draco wasn't one to slur words.

He watched as Draco shook his head, as if trying to clear his thoughts, but the blond obviously didn't succeed because he was still frowning, his eyes focused on something that was not in the carriage, something that was only in his mind.

Bill was worried and he started to speak out, but then Draco laughed, a cold, mirthless, hallow type of chuckle that caused fear to settle in Bill's chest.

"Draco, you alright?"

His voice sounded afraid and he could see Draco trying to pull himself together for his sake. That wasn't what Bill wanted; he wanted Draco to tell him what was wrong, to let Bill know what had happened so he could help.

"I'm fine," said Draco, and Bill was getting sick of that word.

He was about to tell Draco that, but then Draco's face paled as he tried to hitch in a breath. His complexion went from vampire to sheet white, making the bruises that much more pronounced and when the carriage hit a bump, Draco slipped forward, not able to catch himself.

Bill leaned forward, grabbing the boy around the shoulders to stop him from toppling over, and then knelt on the floor, trying to look into the grey eyes, to get Draco to focus.

"Draco, look at me, look at me. What's wrong? What happened, Draco?"

Draco looked as if he didn't understand what he was saying, but his words answered his question anyway.

"Going into shock," said Draco, voice breathy, and then he laughed again.

The grey eyes rolled back in his head and Bill shook Draco slightly.

"Draco, don't fall asleep, you have to stay awake. Stay with me, alright Draco?"

He could see the boy fighting to remain conscious and Bill turned in the direction of the thestrals. "You need to go faster!" he yelled, and even though he doubted the magical horses had heard him, they seemed to sense the urgency.

The carriage jolted again as the thestrals accelerated, and once again Draco nearly slipped out of his seat. Bill tightened his hold, and then sat next to Draco, the kid half in his lap as the grey eyes slowly slipped shut.

"No, dammit Draco. Stay awake!"

Draco's body went slack and Bill lightly slapped Draco's cheek, trying to get him to wake up. One brother in a coma was already too much.

He placed his fingers on Draco's neck, feeling for a pulse. It was there, but weak and Draco's breathing was still strained and uneven. Bill held Draco tighter as the carriage rounded the last bend.

"You trying falling into a coma, and I swear, I will publish the book on the Persian Runes myself," he threatened the white-blond. "I won't even mention you in the dedication."

They pulled up to the castle and Bill easily lifted Draco, one arm under the kid's knees, another supporting his shoulders. Draco was light, he had always been on the thin side, but Bill was pretty sure, with how skinny Draco was now, that he hadn't eaten since he had been captured.

He clamored out of the carriage and then started to run, up the steps and into the school. The halls were empty as it was two in the morning, and the last of the students had cleared out two days ago. The Weasley family, Harry, Hermione, and the professors were the only ones who had stayed.

He reached the infirmary and kicked open the door. Most of his family was up, as they had known that Bill was to be attending the ambush and so had waited for him. They didn't know the full story to why Bill had accompanied the Aurors, but Bill was hoping he would be able to level with them soon.

"Where's Pomfrey?" he demanded, before their expressions could even register surprise at the fact that Bill was holding the son of Lucius Malfoy in his arms.

"In her office," said his mother. "Why-?"

But then Madame Pomfrey was there in full medi-witch mode.

"Sweet Merlin, get him over here now."

Bill set the blond down on the bed she indicated, but Draco didn't even stir at the motion, his skin taking on a grey tinge. Bill swallowed hard, watching as Pomfrey stared a diagnostic spell, and then the medi-witch turned to him.

"Go to the top cupboard and get me the bright orange potion. Now."

Bill hurried to obey, knowing that the potion requested was one that would drastically raise the heart beat and was only used in the most severe of cases. His heart clenched as he ran back, uncorking the bottle and handing it to the nurse. She measured out a capful.

"Raise his head," she instructed.

Bill pulled Draco half-up, tipping his head back and prying open his mouth. Pomfrey poured the potion in his mouth, but he didn't even stir so she shut his lips and covered his nose so he couldn't take a breath. Instinct won over and Draco swallowed and Pomfrey let him breathe again. By this time his complexion was almost blue.

The potion worked almost immediately and Draco choked suddenly, gasping in a breath and his eyes springing open. Bill could see the color returning to his face as he panted, but then Pomfrey was forcing another potion down his throat, and the grey eyes slipped shut again. Bill gently lay Draco back down, and then Pomfrey was gesturing to the curtains around the bed.

"Pull the curtains, please," she said, and Bill did so, ignoring the confused but curious expressions of his family.

Bill turned back around to see Pomfrey waving her wand, and then Draco was in the infamous, blue and white striped infirmary pajamas, his dirty and blood-stained clothes folded neatly on the bedside chair.

"How is he?" asked Bill.

"He should be fine now, if I can get the infection in his arm under control."

"But you just used the blood pressure potion."

"Because he was suffering a classic case of shock made worse by an overdose of anti-sleep medications over the past few days and no substantial nourishment. When the adrenaline faded, nothing in his body was there to keep him conscious and so began to shut down from exhaustion. The potion was to jog his systems back into functioning. He's asleep now, and I'll be monitoring him to make sure it doesn't happen again, but it shouldn't. He's young and children always recover quickly."

"What else is wrong with him?"

"He has a mild concussion," said Pomfrey, pulling his head up so she could feel the back of his skull. "He has a few bumps, but the swelling is mostly gone." She let him lay back down and then cast a spell to clean off the blood on his face and hair. She jotted something down on her clipboard.

"He also cracked two ribs, bruised a few more, but they should heal fine. His ankle is another matter. I'll have to break it again because it's set slightly off. He has a sizeable cut on his left hand, which shouldn't be a problem, but his left arm might prove more difficult. Right now though, I would say he is a very lucky boy."

"When will you know for sure?"

"After I manage to bandage everything up. See if you can find Dumbledore, and let him know that Draco's back. I'll have more news then."

Bill nodded and stepped through the privacy curtains. He just knew that his parents were dying to know what was going on, but he ignored them for now. He just hoped they wouldn't be too upset when they found out exactly how much he had been keeping from them.

Dumbledore was actually on his way to the infirmary with Kingsley Shacklebolt who had just returned as well and was informing the Headmaster of what had happened. Kingsley paused in his narrative when Bill approached.

"How is he?" asked the Auror.

"Passed out on the way here," said Bill. "He said he was going into shock, and he's with Pomfrey now."

"He's been through a lot in the past few days," said Dumbledore, "no doubt it all finally caught up with him."

"How did the ambush go?" asked Bill, turning to Kingsley. The Aurors had made sure to keep him out of the conflict, and he wanted to know exactly how Draco's gamble had paid off.

"I was just telling Dumbledore. We have quite a few injuries but no fatalities, on either side. There were a few serious wounds, the worst of which being Mister Goyle who had his arm cut off."

"What?" asked Bill.

"Apparently they were trying to get Draco away at the last moment with a Portkey, but Draco got hold of a knife, a magical one by the looks of it because it sliced clean through Goyle's arm, and then the Portkey he was holding whisked the limb away."

Bill must have looked horrified because Kingsley laughed.

"He was so terrified that the loss would be permanent that he told the Aurors where the Portkey had gone so that we could retrieve his arm and re-attach it. He's at the hospital now and he'll make a full recovery and because of his openness, we caught three more Death Eaters and have closed down another base of operations for Voldemort."

"How many Death Eaters do you have total?" asked Bill.

"Sixteen, plus the three, so nineteen total."

"Nineteen?" asked Bill, his incredulity obvious.

Dumbledore smiled. "Quite impressive, don't you think."

"To say the least," said Bill, still trying to wrap his mind around what an obvious victory it had been. It even beat out the last success at the Veil which had been nothing to laugh at either.

"That's not the best part," said Kingsley. "We had a bit of trouble getting past the wards on the Veil room, which at first, seemed like it might jeopardize the entire ambush. Because of that, Draco completed the ritual, only instead of pulling out the Horcrux, Draco pulled out Sirius Black instead."

"What?" said Bill. "Is he alive? Is he even…sane?"

"He's at St. Mungo's now, but he's lucid and asking about Harry."

"Wait, should he really be at St. Mungo's? I mean, he hasn't been cleared of murder," said Bill.

Kingsley smiled. "One of the Death Eaters we caught is none other than Wormtail, otherwise known as Peter Pettigrew."

"No," said Bill, absolutely astounded.

"He will be standing trial for framing Sirius for his death, as well as a number of other countless charges."

Bill shook his head. "That is…wow," he laughed.

"So, the genius that planned it all," said Kingsley. "Is he going to be alright?"

"I think so," said Bill.

"Let's go check on him now," said Dumbledore, "and then I'll give the news to Harry first."

Bill felt a lurch of happiness for Harry. He would finally have his family back, his real family.

By the time the three made it back up to the infirmary, Pomfrey was just leaving the privacy curtains, behind which Draco lay.

"How is he?" he asked.

Pomfrey drew them a bit away from the crowd around Ron's bed so that she could speak openly.

"He should be recovered in a few days. He's mostly just banged up, and he has a broken ankle that had to be reset, but what's worrying me most is his left arm. He has a burn straight through it."

"Through his arm?" asked Dumbledore.

"Like a hot poker," said Bill, nodding as he had seen the injury.

Pomfrey shook her head. "His arm was impaled first, and then the wound was seared."

"Shit," said Kingsley, looking as disgusted as Bill felt

"Where on his arm is it?" asked Dumbledore.

"His left forearm," said Pomfrey. "Right in the middle."

Dumbledore nodded, as if understanding something.

"What?" asked Bill.

"The Death Eaters receive their mark on their left forearm. Draco refused."

"So Voldemort decides to stick a knife through his arm and then burn it?" asked Bill, completely outraged.

"Unfortunately," said Dumbledore, "yes."

"The injury isn't threatening, or even debilitating," said Pomfrey. "He'll have full use of his arm and hand, but he will have a nasty scar, and no extent of magical cosmetics is going to change that."

All three glanced at the curtain enclosed bed where Draco lay. Bill didn't think that Draco was particularly vain, but the idea of being marked, even with a scar, by Voldemort was no doubt upsetting to anyone. He wondered what Draco thought of it.

"When will he wake up?" asked Bill.

"Not for twelve hours at least, and if he does, I'll probably just give him a sleeping draught. His body is taxed. I don't think he's been asleep for over three days, and his body shows evidence of ingesting an unsafe amount of sleep suppressants. He also hasn't eaten for days, and that, added to what he's been through, means that he should sleep for long while to recover his strength."

"Let me know when he wakes up," said Dumbledore.

"Same here," said Kingsley. "I'll need to take his statement."

"Tell me first," said Bill. "He needs a friendly face to see before they start hounding him."

"My face isn't friendly?" asked Kingsley. "I'm offended."

Bill grinned and left the room. He had his wife to see, to reassure her that he was alright, and then some sleep to catch up on now that he knew Draco was back. He would be heading over to the infirmary later thought. Draco never slept much, and Bill doubted he could manage more than twelve hours at a time, even if he was exhausted.

I used free online Latin dictionaries for the ritual, so there isn't even a beginning form of grammar, but the gist of the chants are:

Dark changed/altered to Light; Cold to Heat

Earth to Water; Thirst to Replenished

Blood to Flesh; Death to Life

Make anew the Spirit of Sirius Black

So, happy how it turned out? Leave one!





23. Nightmares and Infirmary Visits

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own the very big caffeine headache I am currently experiencing.

Bena24: Yes, it will be a shock for the Weasley's won't it? Unfortunately, they may not find out the entire story for a while yet….

Anna: Well, Bill and Fleur's baby is due towards the end of December, which is in a few weeks for this timeline, so we're actually looking at the third story for the birth, but there will be one, promise.

Silvera: I would like to write a Weasley conniption but they're a little bit preoccupied with Ron right now, but when things are explained, we'll have some shock and disbelief.

Critic: Luckily, Bill's a bit off the hook just because Ron's still in a coma, so his parents aren't as nosey as they could be. I suppose that's good for Bill, else his mother would ream him out.

Molly: We'll see more Ginny in this chapter, and Fleur will have a slightly larger part in the third story, what with the baby and all.

R2D2: lol!

Sabireru: I'm glad you liked it. As for marrying, well, you'd have to be able to support me so I can just write stories all day. How about that?

Sakuya: Yeah, I get that too from my friends. Huh.

SilkeKnuts" Glad you're looking forward to the chapters!

Loopyloki: Thanks for reviewing! I'm glad you're enjoying the story so far.

Lemola: I'm always glad to hear from new readers. I love hearing from people who have read the stories mostly straight through because they have such a different view because they haven't been anticipating the chapters during the week, so it's a very fresh perspective. Thanks again!

Lilith: Yay! Long review! Alright, Lucius with a cane I think I can manage (third story, fancy restaurant, father-son confrontation concerning a third party – look for it) as for slash, sorry, I just don't see it happening. As for the Weasley's finding out, not until the third story, but in the very beginning. I really think this story will only have 27 chapters, so that's like what, four more until the end? Expect angst at the end of this story, lots of it. Yay again. I luv long updates.

Meirta: Thank you very much and I'm glad you decided you liked the chapter. Voldemort's Horcrux is still in the Veil, just Sirius was pulled out, so the Order will have to go back for it.

Spyrit: I've had a few other reviewers comment that Harry and Draco should compare scars, or at least start a convention. Just think, I could sell tickets! And yes, Goyle has the DE code of conduct down in one: follow the Dark Lord for power until you get hurt and then do everything possible to save yourself above all. Voldemort should start recruiting in Huffle-Puff or something. He might get farther.

Freyalyn: Actually, the next few chapters are breathers, or rather, breathers for the reader but Draco's going to get a lot of crap dumped on him. Not in this chapter, but the next coming ones. Thanks for reviewing!

Astaroth: Hope your finals went okay. Mine are coming up in a few weeks. I might or might not update then. It sorta depends how screwed I am. Thanks for reviewing and I'm glad that you liked the chapters.

Sanjs: LOL! You put them on hold? That's brilliant. Hey, if they have time to take a vacation, then they have time to wait while you see how Draco escaped. Seems fair to me.

SilkeKnuts: I'm updating! I swear, and actually, I have most of the rest of this story written.

Katie: I know, I'm late. I'm sorry. But no, not over yet, almost, but not yet.

Drewberry: Yeah, I was excited to bring back Sirius too, but then I actually tried writing him, and now I wonder if he was better off in the Veil, lol. Not that I would do that of course, but it'll be…an experience.

Draco was standing at the Veil, the tattered cloth swaying, just as it had been when he was there with the Death Eaters, but this time the voices were louder. Even so, he couldn't understand them.

He sensed, rather than saw the presence behind him, and he turned to see Dumbledore walking towards him. He frowned, wondering what he was doing there.

"Headmaster," he said, giving a short nod.

Dumbledore took no note of him, and simply continued to walk, not slowing down at all. He knew then what the old man's intention was, and he reached out, intent on stopped the Headmaster, but found he couldn't move. Dumbledore walked right past him, nearing the curtain that separated the dead from the living, and then he was stepping through. Draco couldn't see him on the other side.

Draco stumbled away from the Veil, finally capable of motion and he stared at the tattered cloth, his heart pounding in his chest. Had that really just happened?

The door at the top of the stairs opened and Harry Potter entered, along with a man with wild black hair. Sirius Black.

Black was talking to Harry, and Draco could just make out their conversation.

"Of course it's better on the other side. That's where everyone else is going."

"Then I'm glad to be going with you," said Harry.

"Potter, what the hell are you doing?" Draco demanded, but they didn't notice him. Draco fell into step along side of them, calling Potter's name, but the boy didn't hear him. When he finally reached out, his hand went right through Harry's arm. Was he a ghost then? He hadn't remembered dying. What was going on?

Draco stopped, watching as they too neared the Veil, and then walked through. They disappeared.

Draco ran up the steps of the room, pulling at the door, wanting it to open, to get out, but the door wouldn't budge. He looked around for his wand, but it was gone. He was powerless to escape.

The door opened, emitting Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Draco ignored them, and tried running out the door before it closed, but as soon as he approached it, the door slammed shut, locking him in. He tried pulling on it again to no avail.

"Granger, don't you dare walk through that Veil!" Draco shouted, running to catch up with the two best friends.

"Harry's on the other side," said Ron. "He left already with Sirius."

Hermione smiled and Draco stepped in front of them, holding out his hands, trying to stop them. They walked right through him, like a cool breeze. They stepped through as well.

With dread he turned to the door as it opened again, only to see Ginny Weasley appear with Laney holding her hand.

"No," said Draco, stepping forward. "You're not taking her!"

Ginny looked up at him as she walked down the stairs. "Of course I'm not taking her," she said. "She wants to go herself." Draco was momentarily startled. She could see him?

Laney smiled up at him. "Are you coming too, Uncle Draco?"

"Coming where?" asked Draco.

"To the other side, of course."

"What's on the other side?" asked Draco.

Ginny laughed. "Don't you know? You are a genius, aren't you?"

"If you know can't you just tell me?"

"It doesn't work that way Draco, you know that, or at least, you should be able to realize that."

They were at the Veil now.

"Just tell me why you're going through. What's over there?"

Laney waved good-bye to him and stepped through; Ginny paused at the threshold.

"What's on the other side? Why are you going there?"

Ginny held out her hand. "You have to come with me to figure it out."

Draco looked at her. "Why do I have to hold your hand?"

"You can't ask questions, you just have to do it."

"Why?"

She gave him a sad sort of smile and stepped through the Veil. Draco clenched his jaw in frustration, his fingers tapping out his pattern as he studied the Veil. Should he just step through it?

The door opened again, and two people appeared, but one did not descend the steps. Lucius Malfoy stood in the doorway; Bill Weasley jogged down the stairs. Both watched him.

"Come on, Draco," said Bill. "Let's go."

"Where are you going or can't you tell me?"

"Got it in one," said Bill, giving him a grin. "But you can trust me."

Draco glanced up at the door where his father stood. "He isn't going," he told Bill.

Bill shook his head. "No, he isn't, but if you choose, it has to be now."

"Why can't I have time to think it over?"

"Because life runs on time, and sometimes you don't get time to choose. This is one of those times."

"That's unfair. You obviously had time to choose."

"Don't be ridiculous," said Bill, "this is a dream; it's not really me so I really haven't decided anything. This is just your subconscious trying to make sense out of the past couple of days and trying to figure out just how you feel about actually joining the Order by using the Veil and people in your life to symbolize the choice you have to make and also the alienation you would feel if you did join."

"So what does it matter what I choose then?" asked Draco. "This is just an allegorical representation of my current situation in life which has no bearing on my actual future and which is probably taking place in less than two seconds of real time. It's just a dream."

"Well, that's where lines get blurred a little," said Bill. "You see, you were just involved in a conflict which took place right by Fate's doorstep."

"I don't believe in Fate," said Draco.

"Maybe not, but people have recorded that after a prolonged exposure to the Veil they have an increased sensitivity to visions and foretellings of the future. You can't argue with the facts and that is proven to be true."

"I was in front of the Veil for less than half an hour."

"But you interacted with it. You pulled Sirius Black out of it which means that whatever essence the Veil is giving off when it's not active was significantly increased when you performed the ritual. After all, it was your blood that was used."

"So, what? This is Fate trying to warn me?"

Bill grinned again, but this time enigmatically, his expression holding hidden secrets which the real Bill never showed.

"Maybe," he said.

"But you can't tell me. Just like you can't tell me what's on the other side."

"Right, but I can tell you this, you have to come with me, if at all." Bill held out his hand.

"I can walk through a Veil on my own."

Bill withdrew his hand. "Very well," he said. "But you may not make it on your own; in fact, the odds are very much against you this time."

"This is absurd. I'm going to wake up now."

"You can't wake up if you haven't finished the dream."

"I've always been able to wake myself up out of dreams."

"But not if it really is from Fate."

"There is no Fate!"

Bill gave a slight smile, a sad smile like his sister. "Good-bye then Draco."

He stepped through even as Draco shouted out "Wait!"

He stared at the Veil. They were all gone; all of them.

"Wake up," he muttered, closing his eyes and throwing himself at his mental walls, He was able to wake up from dreams before, why not now? He resorted to digging his nails in his palms, hoping that the pain would wake him up. He could feel his nails biting into his skin, but he remained in the room. He pressed so hard blood started dripping from his hands, and still he was left alone.

He looked up at his father, who jerked his head, telling Draco to come with him.

Draco frowned and then slowly walked up the stairs, but he didn't leave the room, he just looked out of it. There was blood on the floor where his father stood, and further down the hall, behind all of the open doors that led to other rooms, there was screaming, and shouting, and curses ricocheted off walls.

One door in the entrance room was not open though, and from underneath the crack at the bottom, white light streamed out. Draco looked back up at his father who held out a hand for Draco to join him, but his hand was red and dripping blood.

Draco shook his head, backing up from the door.

"I'm sorry," he whispered. "I can't do it."

He turned before he could see his father's reaction and ran down the stone steps. He ran for the Veil, not slowing down because if he did he might lose his nerve. The Veil grew closer, the voices grew louder, and then he was plunging through –

And he stumbled out of the other side, falling to his hands and knees, still in the room with the stone benches and stone floor, and the Veil was merely behind him now, waving faintly as it slowly lost momentum from when he had jumped through. He was still there, still alone.

He looked up, seeing his father at the door, but his father was shaking his head, and turning away. The door started to swing shut.

Draco jumped to his feet, barely feeling his scraped palms and knees. He ran for the door, taking the stairs two at a time, but the door was closing faster, and just as he reached the top, it clanged shut.

"No!"

"No!"

It was the first time Draco had woken up screaming. To be sure, when he had been going through withdrawal he had woken up yelling almost every night, but nightmares had never provoked that kind of response. Usually, his eyes would snap open and he would have to calm his breathing, but that was it. Once he had actually jerked up because of a dream, but the loudest sound that had come from his lips had been a quick intake of air, not even worthy of being called a gasp.

This time, however, it was his own screams that woke him up, and he was bolting out of the bed before he had even opened his eyes. The hands on his chest, and the hands around his wrists caused him to struggle further, but then his eyes were open, taking in the faces around him, and the hands were pushing with back with a strength he couldn't fight.

He frantically searched the faces around him before finding the one with concerned hazel eyes and red hair. He stopped struggling, letting himself go limp against the pillows and trying to gasp in air.

"That's it," said Bill. "Deep breaths, you're okay, you're out. You're going to be alright."

Draco nodded weakly and the hands that had been on his chest, holding him down, were removed. That had been Dumbledore, whose blue eyes twinkled at him reassuringly. The hands were still on his wrists though, Madame Pomfrey holding onto his right and Bill holding his left.

"Relax your hands," said Pomfrey gently. "Let's see what you did."

Draco finally realized that his fists were clenched, and that his nails were embedded in his flesh. He had to actually concentrate on releasing his fingers because his knuckles had locked from the pressure he had put on them.

"There you go," said Pomfrey, examining his right palm, but Bill had to help uncurl his left fingers. Draco winced in pain; Bill winced in sympathy.

"Some minor cuts, but your right hand will be alright. I'll put some cream on this. Bill, how's his left hand doing?"

"Not so good," said Bill.

Draco sat up a bit to peer at the damage he had done. It wasn't that bad; he had just managed to reopen the cut that the Dark Lord had given him and it was bleeding afresh.

Pomfrey smeared some cream on his right hand and then cleaned the blood from his left before bandaging it.

"How are you feeling?" she asked.

"I'm fine," said Draco.

She gave him a look and so Draco actually considered the question. His entire back was sore, but his ribs were no longer hurting him so much. His head, for the first time in days, wasn't throbbing, just a slight ache, and his ankle was numb. The only part of him that really hurt was his left arm. Even his hands were feeling better now that the cream had been put on them.

"My arm is sore," he said. "That's it."

"We'll see how you are feeling in the morning, and if it is still painful when you wake up, I'll give you a pain reliever."

"What do you mean when I wake up?" Draco demanded. He wasn't going back to bed, not when he had just slept for – what time was it? "What time is it?"

"Three," said Bill. "You slept over twelve hours."

"And you're going to sleep another twelve at least," said Pomfrey.

"I'm not going to sleep an entire day," said Draco. "There are things to do." He turned to Dumbledore. "The Dark Lord knows how to call the horcrux out. You should put Aurors on the coin display so he can't try himself."

"The coins sent to Germany are duplicates. The originals are at the Order's Headquarters," said Dumbledore. "You see, we have everything all taken care of. Go back to sleep, Draco."

Draco frowned at that. "Well, you should still get the horcrux out now. Given time, the Dark Lord will set up spies in the Ministry to alert him when you try to pull it out, and he'll fight for it rather hard. The ritual isn't that hard, but if Bill hasn't translated the runes yet I could accompany you."

"We'll risk waiting," said Dumbledore. "I have no doubt the security around the Veil will be quite sufficient for a later retrieval, but I promise, you shall be the one to call the Horcrux out. I think you have deserved that, most assuredly."

Pomfrey held out a vial of sleeping potion; Draco glared at it.

"I'm not tired," he said.

"Maybe not your mind, but your body needs it."

"I'm not taking it."

"Draco."

Draco turned to Bill. "I'm not tired!" he protested.

"Then why are you whining like a four year old?" asked Bill, amusement in his hazel eyes.

Draco opened his mouth to retort, but he realized he had been somewhat childish about the whole thing. He was obviously not going to get any support from Bill, or Dumbledore for that matter.

"I don't want to go to sleep," he said, his mind flashing back to the disturbing dream about a Veil and trying to run through it.

"I'll give you some Dreamless Sleep after you take this one," said Pomfrey, understanding the hesitation.

Draco stared at the vial she held out to him.

"If you don't take it, I'll go Muggle and give you an injection," said Pomfrey.

"Fine," said Draco.

He took the vial with ill-grace and tipped it into his mouth. The potion wasn't unpleasant, but that didn't mean it tasted good. He handed the empty vial back to Pomfrey and then settled back on the pillows, wincing slightly as his body reminded him that he had been a visitor of the Dark Lord's for the past few days and was still re-cooperating.

Pomfrey hustled off to get the second potion and Draco stared up at the ceiling, making it clear that he did not want to go back to sleep, nor did he think it was necessary.

"You going to be alright, Draco?" Bill asked quietly.

"I'm fine," said Draco.

"Was it a nightmare?"

Draco rolled his eyes to show that it was a stupid question.

"Do you want to talk about it?"

"No."

"Sometimes it helps if you do."

"I don't remember it," said Draco coolly.

The nurse came back over with the second potion and Draco downed it before rolling onto his side and glaring at the three of them.

"I'm trying to sleep here," he said testily.

Dumbledore chuckled. "Of course, my apologies. Sleep well, Draco."

He left, as did Pomfrey, and Draco was left glaring at Bill who merely smiled at him.

"I'm glad you're back, Draco."

"'Course I'm back," said Draco, biting back a yawn as the potion took hold of him. "I'm a bloody genius."

"A rather cranky genius."

"I don't do cranky; I merely become annoyed at the deficiencies of others."

Bill laughed. "Go to sleep, Draco. Merlin knows you need it."

"I'm trying. You insist on conversing with me."

Bill smiled. "Good night, then. Sleep well."

Draco nodded and the former Professor got up to leave, but Draco stopped him.

"Bill."

Bill raised his eyebrows.

"Thanks," said Draco, not quite smoothly, but expressing his gratitude wasn't quite as awkward as it had been a year ago. "For coming to the Veil."

"Anytime," said Bill seriously.

"Bloody Gryffindor," Draco muttered.

He was asleep only a few moments later.

He woke up once in the night, and he opened his eyes enough to see the Weasley father sitting over Ron's inert form, and for some reason, he felt a bolt of sympathy for the red-haired family, but before he allowed himself to empathize further, or mentally kick himself for the emotion, he rolled over and fell back asleep.

The next time he awoke was early morning. The sun was up, but only just fully so, and the infirmary was bright and quiet. Draco stared at the sunbeams on the high ceiling before deciding that he was bored. He was just contemplating the pros and cons of getting out of bed when the infirmary door swung open and Ginny Weasley entered.

She was no doubt checking on her brother, but when she saw him awake, she made a detour for his bed.

"Hi," she said.

Draco raised an eyebrow, wondering why the girl felt compelled to speak with him, but sat up. She took the chair next to his bed.

"Feeling better?" she asked.

"I'm fine."

Instead of rolling her eyes like everyone else, she smiled. "Well, that's good, because you look like shit."

Draco blinked. "Pardon?"

She shrugged. "You're really pale."

"I'm always pale."

"You're paler than usual, and you've got circles under your eyes."

"Why do I care?"

She shrugged. "Just thought you might want to know."

"And I thought people were supposed to be nice to those in the infirmary."

"But that's so boring. Don't tell me you actually want me to ask you a thousand and one questions to see how you are doing and then tell you that you're looking a lot better. In this case, the truth is much more interesting."

Draco stared at her. "You're a morning person, aren't you?"

"No, I'm always like this."

"Incredibly obnoxious?"

"Talkative, blunt, extremely attractive, you know."

Draco snorted to avoid actually laughing at her.

"You look nicer when you aren't frowning," she told him seriously.

"I thought I looked like shit."

"Yeah, but at least you're a smiling pile of shit."

"Flattered, I'm sure."

She grinned. "Well, I'm off to go check on Ron. Here, you look bored. I finished it already."

She handed him a book and then skipped off to her father who had fallen asleep by the Weasel's bed. Draco read the title, recognizing it as Marlin Brimley's latest work. He had actually wanted to read it. He shifted his pillows so he was sitting up more comfortably and flipped it open.

He was half-way through the first chapter when Pomfrey came in, and after examining him and giving him a few potions, got him breakfast. Draco absentmindedly ate while he read, putting the book down when Pomfrey collected his empty dishes and swinging his legs over the side of the bed.

"What are you doing?" Pomfrey asked in a stern, disbelieving voice.

Draco paused. "Getting up?"

She snorted. "As if. Back in bed."

"I feel fine," said Draco.

"That's because you just woke up and your body is still under the influence of several heavy pain medications. You were seriously injured when you came here, and you are still recovering."

"I can recover in my room just as well as here."

"You cannot because I would not be there to check-up on you. Further strain on your body would just harm yourself and hinder your recovery."

"Going to my room isn't going to add stress," said Draco.

"Let me be the judge of that," said Pomfrey. "Besides, I had to reset your ankle, so you can't put any pressure on it for two days."

Draco knew she was right, and he grudgingly lay back on the bed. Still, two days was a long time to be stuck in the infirmary. He sighed and picked up the book again. Pomfrey sighed and pulled the blankets up over him, leaving with a shake of her head and muttering about foolish patients catching cold. Draco rolled his eyes.

He was on the third chapter when Bill came in, smiling when he spotted Draco sitting up with the book.

"Look who's awake," he said, coming over and claiming the chair by his bed.

"Don't say it like it's something amazing," said Draco, "I was awake yesterday too."

"And you're still just as cranky," said Bill.

Draco put down the book to look at him. "I'm stuck here for two days," he told Bill, a roundabout way of apologizing for being so curt.

"I'm sorry," said Bill. "Do you want anything?"

"Not right now," said Draco, holding up the book.

"Isn't that Ginny's?" asked Bill.

"She's done with it and gave it to me. Something about I looked like shit and really bored."

"So, you read Brimley as well."

"Surprised?"

"Not really. But I do have something that you'll probably like." Bill reached into his coat pocket and produced a wand. Draco immediately knew it was his and he hadn't realized how much he missed it until Bill placed it into his palm.

"Where did you-?"

"At your house," said Bill. "The Aurors swept through it and found the collection of wands taken from you and the other students. And I knew someone at the Ministry, so even though normally they would have confiscated this…," Bill pulled a second wand from his pocket and Draco raised an eyebrow.

"That's my unregistered wand," he said.

"Yeah, just don't tell anyone. You'll ruin my Gryffindor image."

Draco smirked and took that wand as well, twirling them both through his fingers to check feel for any spells or fractures in the wood, but they were both sound.

"Do you know-," he started, but then Bill handed him the ivory charm on the black leather strap.

"Thanks," he said, pulling it over his head and tightening the slip knots so that the necklace hung close around his neck.

"Do you ever take it off?" asked Bill.

"Are you going to get sentimental if I tell you no?"

"Probably," said Bill.

Draco smirked but told the truth. "I don't," he said.

Bill smiled, but changed the subject. "How are you feeling?"

"Pretty good right now, but Pomfrey says it's just the pain meds."

"I don't doubt it. You were beat up rather badly."

Draco shrugged. "I survived."

The doors opened again, admitting Dumbledore and Kingsley Shacklebolt. Draco sighed as the two approached.

"How are you feeling today, Draco?" asked Dumbledore.

"Fine," said Draco.

"You use that word too much," said Bill.

"Are you feeling up to giving your statement to Kingsley?" asked the Headmaster, twinkling at Bill's somewhat resigned comment.

"Nothing else to do."

"And would you mind if I sat in as well?"

"You have nothing to do too?" asked Draco, but then he shrugged and turned to Bill. "I suppose you're going to ask now as well?"

"No, I'm going to sit in whether you like it or not."

Draco snorted, and then Bill pulled the curtains half-way shut to block out the other side of the room which consisted of Weasleys. He returned to his seat, and then Dumbledore conjured two more for himself and Kingsley. The Auror pulled out a piece of parchment and set a dictating quill on it.

"Start at the beginning," said Kingsley. "Where were you when the alarm went off?"

"In my room," said Draco. "I had just figured out the grammar syntax of the second Persian Runes when the warning bell rang and I left to go find Laney."

He related the events of getting out of the castle with Laney, and then trying to make it to the boats that were being overturned by the Death Eaters. He described getting captured by the Death Eaters and waking up in his own home. Bill had looked positively worried when he mentioned being taken to the Dark Lord and he glazed over the bit about the knife by merely raising his bandaged arm and saying 'That's when I got this.'

He then described the escape plan, but as he had already translated the chapter title of the code, he gave the information to Ron for him to take back, and then he had stayed. The Dark Lord had thought it was a trap though, and had put him in with Claire. He saw through the test, tried to escape, and managed to fall down a flight of stairs for his trouble. He then related being taken into a room to translate the runes with Lorenzo Holiday and Claire Jameson.

"About Holiday," said Dumbledore. "He was found at his house a day ago. He's-,"

"Dead," said Draco. "I know. He wasn't being the greatest of helps, and when the Dark Lord found out, he killed him." He shook his head. "I could have included him more, but he kept thinking that I was translating it the wrong way, and he wasn't listening to me. We were all working on no sleep and just the wakefulness potions, so we were…easily aggravated. When he finally fell asleep, I told Claire that he wasn't helping anyway, so she should just leave him. And when the Dark Lord came in and wondered why he wasn't helping, Claire told him that Holiday wasn't exactly useful, so…," Draco trailed off, before shrugging slightly, trying to sound as if he didn't care, but his voice caught when he spoke next. "Perhaps I should have…explained better so he could have helped."

"You couldn't have done anything," said Dumbledore. "Voldemort does not keep his prisoners alive when they are of no use to him anymore. Holiday would have been killed if he had helped or not."

Draco nodded, having already known that, but it was still a topic he didn't like to think about. He told them about arriving at the Ministry next, and pulling Sirius Black out instead of the horcrux.

"At first I thought that when I pulled out Black, the horcrux would come out as well because he had been holding onto it, but while I was in the cell I realized that the Horcrux is a soul of its own, or at least, a part of a soul. Because of that, they would be mutually exclusive, but the Dark Lord wasn't aware of that, so when I did pull Black out, he didn't object. He was rather irate when he discovered that his Horcrux wasn't retrieved. I may have…taunted him about that. When he discovered the Aurors were coming, he tried to have me Portkeyed away, but I escaped by cutting off Goyle's arm." He grimaced at that.

"It's been reattached. He'll be fine," said Bill. "Well, fine in Azkaban."

Draco was strangely relieved to hear that. If he had killed him, he doubted he would have felt as guilty because Goyle had killed children before, but maiming someone like that was a little more disconcerting, probably because after having a knife through his own arm he was a little more appreciative of the limbs.

"How's your arm doing?" asked Bill, as if reading his thoughts.

"It's alright," said Draco.

"You have a hole through your arm," said Bill.

"It's alright, considering," Draco amended. He changed the subject. "What about Black? I didn't really want to pull him from the Veil right then, but the Aurors were somewhat late in arriving so I couldn't wait for Healers to stand by in case he was in shock or…well, ailing."

"He's fine," said Bill. "He's in St. Mungo's right now, but before he was conscious and aware and asking about Harry."

Draco frowned. "Isn't he still wanted for murder?"

"Wormtail was captured as well," said Bill. "Oh, did you know that Wormtail is-,"

"Peter Pettigrew," said Draco. "Who faked his own death and framed Black for others as well."

"You already knew that?"

Draco shrugged. "I've a Death Eater for a father," he said, by way of explanation.

"One thing I'm unclear on," said Kingsley. "Where did you get the knife?"

"It was the one that stabbed my arm, and also burnt it. During the escape I pocketed it, and it seems to have some sort of…invisibility ward on it, but can also change sizes to accommodate its surroundings. It's probably still in my trouser pocket, if you know where those went?"

"Your clothes have been cleaned and put in your room," said Dumbledore. "If what you say is true, than you will be the only person who can take the knife out because it sounds very much as if it's been bonded to you."

"That's what I thought," said Draco. "But I'll have to check the wards on the knife and see for sure."

"Do wait until you are recovered," said Dumbledore. "The crisis is over, and I think it's best to let yourself recharge before attempting to take apart what is most likely a rather complex dark artifact."

"I just slept for over twenty-four hours. I don't think I can get more 'recharged' than I am right now."

"Let your body heal then, yes. No strenuous activities until you are out of the infirmary."

"What am I supposed to do then?" asked Draco, irritation seeping through his voice.

"You could take up crosswords," suggested Bill.

"Harry, you need to wake up."

Harry groaned and rolled over, blinking open his eyes to spot the Headmaster by his bed, a candle in his hands. A sudden, chilling thought raced into Harry's mind and he jerked up.

"What's happened? Is it Ron? He's not dead, is he? He can't be dead-,"

"Harry, calm yourself. The news is much happier in nature."

"He woke up then?"

"This news does not concern Mr. Weasley."

"Then how can it be good news?" Harry muttered, but Dumbledore was already turning towards the door.

Harry grabbed a blanket from the bed and wrapped it around himself. It was December after all, and even magical castles are cold at night. He padded down the stairs into the Common Room. Dumbledore was seated on one of the armchairs and Harry took the one opposite him. Dumbledore had a bottle of butterbeer and two cups. He poured Harry a mug full and Harry took the drink suspiciously. The Headmaster had said it was good news, so why-?

"Harry, do you know why Draco Malfoy was a target for the Death Eaters?"

Harry frowned. "Is he alright?"

"He's fine, well, he's back here and injured, but he'll recover."

"But how-?"

"Answer my questions first, and then I'll answer yours. I promise."

Harry nodded and took a few sips of the butterbeer. It seemed fair enough.

"He translated something that the Dark Lord wanted, didn't he? It had to do with getting Voldemort's horcrux out of the Veil."

"That's right," said Dumbledore. "Before Ron slipped into a coma, he managed to give word from Draco to William. Draco was planning to lead the Death Eaters to the Veil tonight."

"And you ambushed them," said Harry, jumping to the correct conclusion.

"That's right," said Dumbledore. "The Aurors got Draco out and apprehended nineteen Death Eaters, including one Peter Pettigrew."

Harry gave a bitter smile. "So Sirius can have his good name back," he said. He took a long draught of the butterbeer, suppressing the loneliness and guilt he felt when he remembered Sirius.

When he put the cup down, Dumbledore was watching him.

"Harry, when the Aurors ambushed the Death Eaters, they had trouble getting inside the Veil room. Because of that, Draco completed the ritual, but Draco didn't pull out Voldemort's horcrux. Harry, Draco pulled out Sirius."

Harry blinked at the Headmaster and then realized that he wasn't going to be able to hold his cup anymore. He set it gently on the table and then looked back at Dumbledore.

"Sirius is out," he repeated.

Dumbledore smiled. "He's alive Harry. He's alive, and well, and in St. Mungo's. Fudge is issuing a full pardon right now, and Harry, he was asking for you. Sirius wants to see you."

Harry laughed in disbelief, amazement, and joy, and then realized that his eyes were stinging as well but he couldn't even brush away the tears. Dumbledore seemed to understand because his blue eyes were twinkling and then he was pulling Harry up and holding him close until Harry could stand on his own.

"Go get dressed, Harry. We're going to St. Mungo's."

Harry barely remembered bolting up the stairs to throw on his clothes, and it was a miracle that he even managed to get them on properly. Dumbledore had a portkey straight to the hospital, and then Harry and Dumbledore were appearing in the middle of a waiting room, and he was being rushed into a private room guarded by Aurors.

There was shouting coming from the room. A hoarse, irritated voice insisting that he was fine, that he didn't need to be bloody examined and there was no way he was going to go to sleep. Hell no, he was going to see his godson if he had to exercise his rights as a British citizen and walk out of there right now.

Harry grinned and then stepped into the room, his eyes feasting on the sight of the tall man in a hospital gown trying to get out of bed while three nurses tried to prevent him.

"Sirius," he said.

Sirius looked up, his eyes lighting on his face and breaking out into the huge grin that Harry had missed so much. Sirius held out his arms and Harry didn't hesitate. He ran straight to his godfather, flinging his arms around his neck and clinging to him like he was never letting go. Sirius returned the embrace.

"I thought you were dead," Harry managed roughly.

"Dead?" Sirius scoffed. "It takes more than some moth-eaten curtain to take me out."

Harry laughed, but held on that much tighter.

Yay! Sirius!

Ahem. Anyways, sorry about the confusion about did I update, did I miss a week, what happened, etc. Well, F-fic was experiencing troubles, so I was experiences troubles, but it's all better now so leave a review.

Oh, little info on the up coming chapters. Most of the action is over for this story, and I can tell you that there will be 27 chapters in this one, so it's almost over, but before I move onto the third, Draco will show how to save a life (lol-song not mine), get disowned, and experience some angst which may push him to a breaking point. Just to let you know. Now you can leave a review.





24. Books, Thanks, and a Bad Prognosis

Disclaimer: If I owned Harry Potter, then I wouldn't have to look for a job. I am looking for a job; you figure out the logic.

A/N: Hi! Umm, so the long wait. Well, finals sucked and I sorta realized that a lot more studying would have to be involved. We're talking 7 hours of sleep in 48. Then, I had to pack and drive home. Then I had to unpack, apply for jobs, and now I'm just waiting. Life, sigh.

Anna: Dec 9th? Sorry, just a few days too early. But it'll be close. Thanks for reviewing.

Bena24: Yeah, it would be a good chapter (Sirius finding out about Draco), however, because my Sirius isn't quite up to par with Rowling's, we just may have to skip that a little bit (sheepish smile).

R2D2: I try to keep all my chapters at around 17 pages, and that one almost made it, but I think it seemed even shorter because the dream sequence was so long, and I totally didn't mean for it, but it just happened.

Sayuka: Yeah, I've started outlining the third which will go up right after the third, and actually I think for the complete series, I actually need a fourth story (so Voldemort can be defeated). The fourth will not be up right after the third though. I'm going to take a break and put up a different one, because I think by the time I'm done with the third, I'm going to be sick of them.

SilkeKnuts: Thank you!

ScrappedScarlet: I'm glad that you like it! As for the romance, I know that sometimes on this site, the romances are so cliché you just want one without it, but, if you don't like how the D/G turns out, you've got two stories without it! Thanks.

Freyalyn: I really like that 'deficiencies of others' line as well, so I love it when reviewers mention it. It makes me feel that my pride is justified. And don't worry, there will be lots of huggy moments in the third story with Draco joining the Order even though the rest of this story may be kinda angsty.

Spyrit: Ack. Sorry about the wait. The dream has more meaning, and may be explored a bit more in the third but will have more bearing on the fourth (oh gosh, I just can't get away from this series). The third will be up right after the second, but the fourth might be on hold, because I have a feeling I'll need to take a break. I do not know how J.K. did seven in a row. Insane.

Beth: Rest assured, there will be a third with a D/G relationship, and it will be up right after the second, so there's no need to cry. I'm glad you like it that much though!

Molly: You nailed it in one, the adults are making Laney wait because Draco isn't in any danger, he just needs to sleep. And the dream does indeed have deeper meanings. And Pomfrey really is looking for a miracle in trying to keep Draco in bed. Thanks!

Katie: Nope, not over yet, and then there's the third. Thanks for reviewing!

Sanjs: The charm was what Bill gave Draco for Christmas in the first book, and Draco hadn't taken it off until then. As for what Sirius saw behind the Veil, umm, well I think he forgot most of it when he came back out, but I may toy with the idea of him seeing something. Thanks for the idea, and for the review.

Lilith: I'm going to make you SQUEE again. I'm going to write a fourth. Don't get to happy, because while the third will follow the second right after, the fourth won't. The fourth is going to be after I get to write a few others. Oh, and Draco doesn't have an actual hole in his arm anymore, it's just scar tissue now. And no, never sick of long reviews!

Helen: Ah! I just made you wait three weeks. Oops, sorry. But I'm glad you're liking the story. And yes, the D/G will be starting right at the beginning of the third story, which will be following the second very closely, so I hope you like it!

Natalie: Umm, I actually forget what's in this chapter. There's some slight D/G I think, but the real relationship will start right at the beginning of the third story.

Tespu: You've probably really lost all feeling for this fic now that it's been so long. You can re-read it though I guess, unless re-reading things is boring for you, because I know sometimes it's tedious to do so.

Anon: Yeah, everything's good. Just life interrupting. Sorry for the wait, but thanks for asking! I feel loved.

Draco was sick of being in the infirmary, and it was only mid-afternoon. So far Pomfrey had given him more potions, had made him soak his arm in a basin full of murtlap and other herbs, and then forced him to choke down all of his lunch by holding his, or rather Ginny's, book hostage until he had eaten enough to her satisfaction. Draco was debating whether or not he should purposefully make himself sick just so that she would understand that there was only so much he could actually fit into his stomach.

The crowd of red-haired bystanders only made the whole thing that much worse because he was sure that they had come to the correct conclusion (that he wasn't exactly on the Death Eaters' side), but they were still wary of him. He could see it in the way they would glance over to his bed every now and then. He ignored them, pointedly.

He was in the middle of the seventh chapter when the door opened and a cry of 'Uncle Draco!' made him jerk his head up. He, of course, was expecting his niece and sister-in-law as Dumbledore had explained to him that Laney and Sam were staying at the Order until the threat had passed and that Laney was anxious to see him.

Laney ran over to the bed and immediately climbed up, throwing her arms around his neck and squeezing tight. He hugged her as well, damn the fact that his shoulders and ribs protested at the motion.

When the little girl finally pulled away, Sam was there to embrace him as well, but gentler, and giving him a kiss on the cheek.

"How are you?" she asked.

"A little sore, but I'm alright," said Draco truthfully. "How are you doing?"

"Overwhelmed," said Sam, giving a little smile. "Staying with a houseful of wizards and witches is fascinating, but a little much at the same time. But everyone has been wonderful."

"Who's been at the house?"

"Tonks is staying there for a while, as well as her parents, so I'm not the only one who can't levitate a chair. Remus Lupin has taken up residence and he's been teaching me some finer facts of magical life. He was your professor, right?"

Draco nodded.

"Fleur Weasley has been coming over as well. She's a lovely girl, and occasionally a few other members or professors come to check up on us."

"Sometimes Professor McGonagall comes and she changes into her cat to play with Merlin," said Laney. "And Fleur taught me how to change Merlin's fur color. He looks really pretty when he's blue but I don't think he likes it very much."

Draco's lips twitched. "No, I don't think he would."

"Tonks can change too, but not into an animal, just people. She changed into Dumbledore once, it was really funny. And Mr. Tonks has really cool coloring supplies. Did you know he can't do magic either? But he paints really pretty. He let me paint some too. Mom, do you have it?"

Sam smiled and pulled a piece of paper from her purse. She handed it to Laney who thrust it in front of Draco's face.

"See?" she said. "That's Merlin, and me and you and Mom at Hogwarts."

"I see," said Draco.

"I painted it so you could have it," she said.

He took the picture, smiling slightly. It was easy to tell which blob was who, but that was about it.

"It's very pretty," he said. "Thinking of art as a career?"

"Nope," said Laney. "I want to teach Transfigurations at Hogwarts."

Of course she would.

"Laney!"

All three turned to see Ginny Weasley enter the room and wave at Laney. The girl, in response, got off of the bed and ran over to give Ginny a hug. Ginny scooped the girl up and walked over to Draco and Sam.

"How've you been?" Ginny was asking. "I haven't seen you in so long."

"I've been good," said Laney, as Ginny set her back down on the bed. "We're visiting Uncle Draco."

"So I see," said Ginny. She turned to Sam. "Hi, I'm Ginny. I'm in Laney's house."

Sam shook her hand. "I'm Samantha, Laney's mum. She's talked a lot about you."

"Uh-oh," said Ginny, shooting a look at Laney, who giggled.

"So, you know Draco then, yes?" asked Sam.

"Oh yeah," said Ginny. "We went to the Halloween Dance together." She gave Draco a sweet smile and Draco rolled his eyes.

"It wasn't like that," he said.

"Mm-hmm," said Ginny, in a 'whatever you say' sort of tone. She was practically smirking at him. "Well, I've got to go. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Chalmers."

"It's Sam."

"Sam," Ginny corrected. She gave them a quick smile and then walked off to join her family. Sam turned to Draco with raised eyebrows.

"The dance, Draco?"

"Her idea, not mine."

"But you still said yes."

"Because she was bloody annoying about it."

"I think she's sweet," said Sam. "Really cute too, wouldn't you say?"

She was baiting him.

"No, red-heads aren't my type," said Draco.

"Nonsense. Every guy likes a red-head, don't even try denying that."

"I like her," said Laney. "I think you should marry her, Uncle Draco."

Draco groaned. "I'm not going to marry her, Laney. I don't even like her like that."

"Like what?"

"Like how your mum liked your dad."

"Oh. But when are you going to find someone you like?"

"Ten years," said Draco, just to displace any notion that he was going to 'like' someone.

"I don't know," said Sam, peering after Ginny. "Spend a couple of days with her, and I think you might change your mind."

Draco sighed, but didn't debate it any further. There was no point trying to argue with women.

Sam and Laney didn't stay long after that because Pomfrey insisted that Draco needed to take a nap. Draco told her that the nurse was suffering from a severe case of insanity if she thought he was actually going to sleep again. Pomfrey gave a look to Sam, who immediately started fussing over him, tucking him into bed, kissing him on the cheek, and then telling him to sleep because it would make her feel better, knowing that he was recovering well.

The lady was Slytherin, through and through.

Draco found himself lying on the bed, staring up at the ceiling with the curtains pulled shut, wondering how Sam had gotten him to promise he would at least try to get some sleep. He also wondered why it sounded so good.

He did sleep, for three hours in fact, a real, deep, dreamless sleep, only waking up when his curtains were pulled back a bit and Bill peeked through.

"Oh," said Bill. "You sleeping?"

"No," said Draco, rubbing his eyes and sitting up.

Bill laughed and then took a seat by his bed, setting a bag down on the floor. "How have you been?" he asked, then quickly added, "if you say fine, I will put a silencing charm on you for your duration of your hospital stay."

Draco smirked. "Tolerable," he said.

"Very cute."

"I am though, the 'f' word," said Draco. "And I'm getting more sleep than is good for me."

"Nonsense. You have to make up for all those sleepless nights somehow, why not now?"

"I've overcompensated at this point. I'll be up all night."

"Somehow I doubt that."

Draco rolled his eyes, and then turned to prop the pillows up behind him. And of course because Bill was there, and because Bill was a Gryffindor, he was immediately taking over the task.

"I am capable of moving my own pillows," said Draco, once they had been arranged to Bill's satisfaction.

"I know," said Bill. "I just like to annoy you." His tone was teasing and his eyes sparkled, almost like Dumbledore's. Draco snorted.

"What's in the bag?" he asked.

"This," said Bill, reaching down to open it, "is for you. I've got you Theories of Transfigurations, Creating Potions without the Cauldron, a book on Quantum Physics, and a book on alternate universes, string theory, and other crazy smart stuff. Then, when you get bored of that, I got you a book of sudoku. They're these number puzzle things. I got you the expert level one, because, well, knowing you it won't take you all that long to do them."

Bill set the books on the bed and Draco sifted through them before looking up at Bill.

"Thanks," he said.

"Oh no, this is purely self-protection," said Bill. "I figured since we are keeping you in bed against your will, I should at least make sure that you aren't plotting retaliation. See, with all of this, your mind will be otherwise occupied."

Draco smirked.

There were a few exclamations outside the curtain and Bill peeked out.

"Harry's here," he said. "I'll be right back."

Bill left and Draco picked up the sudoku puzzle book. He knew what it was, but he had never tried one. He flipped to the first page and stared at the square. Only a few numbers were filled in, and it took him a few moments, but once he had filled in a row, it was easier to see which numbers worked where. He was done in a little over a minute; it was actually rather fun.

He paged to the back to see that there was another version of the game, one where a few blocks were highlighted and the total of their numbers given. This one proved to be more difficult, and he was just debating the use of a quill when the privacy curtains were pulled back to reveal Harry and Hermione.

"What?" he asked.

"You got Sirius out of the Veil," said Harry.

"So?"

Harry smiled, his green eyes radiating sincerity. "Thank you," he said. "Thank you so much. You don't understand what this means to me. I don't know how I can-,"

"Potter, if I had known that you were going to subject me to the ramblings of your gratitude, I would have left him in the Veil."

Harry just grinned. "Yeah, I was thinking about giving you a thank you card, but I figured you would just burn it. But that's okay. I'll find someway to say thank you, and it will be something that you won't be able to say 'no' to."

"Spare me," said Draco.

"Well, you seem to be alright," said Hermione. "Still as sarcastic as ever. I'm actually somewhat thankful for that."

"I don't know," said Harry. "I think Snape has enough snark for everyone in the Order."

"I'm not in the Order."

"Well," said Harry, "that's something I want to talk to you about."

"Don't tell me Dumbledore sent you to recruit me," said Draco.

"Nope," said Harry. "It's just that, well, now that most of the Order knows that you aren't a Death Eater, I don't see what's holding you back from joining."

"The mutual dislike for one."

"Draco, you just pulled my godfather out of the Veil. I doubt anyone of them could dislike you now. Besides, most of them have met Laney and Sam and they get along fantastically."

"Fine. There's my general dislike of you people."

"Bullshit."

That was Hermione and both boys turned to her in shock, although Harry did look a little proud of his girlfriend.

"What?" asked Draco.

"You don't dislike them, you just don't get along with them. Besides, you like me and Harry, don't you?"

"Don't push it."

"And you like Bill, and you seem to converse well with Dumbledore and Kingsley. Tonks is your cousin, you've trained Hagrid's thestral. You may not like Ron, but you can deal with him. In fact, the only person you probably don't like is Moody, and he's not even the Moody that turned you into a ferret."

Harry choked back a laugh; Draco glared at him.

"Besides," the Head Girl continued, "you can't do anything really big against Voldemort on your own. Even with your ambush at the Veil you still had to rely on the Order and Aurors. You're a genius, but even you need manpower. Besides, your goal must be to get rid of Voldemort, but Harry is the only one that can defeat him, so doesn't it make sense to join? Besides, you could shock the hell out of everyone when you join. Personally, I would do it just for the looks on their faces."

She had a point, but Draco wasn't going to tell her that.

"So," said Hermione, looking quite pleased with herself. "Are there any other objections you have?"

"You forgot to account for the fact that I can be contrary just for the sake of proving you wrong," said Draco.

Hermione's face fell, and she really did look quite disappointed. Draco sighed.

"I'll think about it," he said. "No promises."

Hermione smiled, grabbing Harry's hand excitedly. "Great!"

"I said I would think about it," said Draco. "Not that I was bloody joining."

"I know," said Hermione. "But I also know that you are a genius and so you thinking about it must mean that you will come to the correct conclusion, that joining the Order is the best thing to do, and so you will."

Draco groaned and Harry laughed at him, before being pulled away by Hermione.

"Sirius says 'thank you' too, by the way." And then the boy-hero and his girlfriend were gone and Draco let loose a breath before turning back to the numbers.

He didn't even look up when Bill returned, because although he had registered the eldest Weasley boy, he hadn't exactly noticed him. He frowned at the page, his fingers tapping out his pattern as his brain spouted out possibilities. This one took three minutes and then he smirked in satisfaction and set the book to the side.

"You really get into that, don't you?" asked Bill.

He shrugged. "It's fun."

Bill smiled, opened his mouth, shut it, and seemed to consider something for a moment. Draco raised an eyebrow as the ex-professor suddenly looked a little hesitant.

"Spit it out."

Bill sighed. "Alright," he said. "It's just, I don't want to pressure you or anything, and I know that perhaps this isn't the best time to ask, and maybe I just shouldn't ask at all, because it is your life, not mine, but, well…,"

"Well?" Draco prodded.

"I was wondering if you would let me tell my parents about you, about, well, explain to them why all of a sudden I'm acting like you're my new best friend. I mean, they're pretty sure that your not a Death Eater and all, but they've been grilling me and it's getting tiresome, so are you planning on revealing your genius anytime soon to the general population? It doesn't have to be now, or anything, but they've become somewhat disapproving."

"You're an adult for Merlin's sake," said Draco. "Can't you just not tell them? It's not like they can ground you or anything."

Bill flushed and Draco realized that he probably didn't quite realize what was going on here.

"Wait," he said, "is this one of those I can't quite comprehend why secrets of such magnitude might cause family problems because I under-value the significance of truth and familial relationships?"

"Well, I could just be way too concerned with their good opinion, and I really shouldn't have to explain to them my every move, it's just that, we're a close family. We could be too close, though. It might be that too, I mean-,"

"Bill, you're rambling."

"Sorry."

"Do you think it's possible to be too close to your family?" he asked.

Bill shook his head. "No."

Draco mulled that over. "And this is important to you."

"Yeah."

Draco nodded, looking down at his right hand which was tapping his 1-3-2-4 pattern so quickly his fingers were bungling. He forced himself to stop and take a breath.

"Do you think you could wait a few days?" he asked, his voice quiet and hesitant for some reason. He didn't like it.

"Of course," said Bill. "And I don't want you to do anything you're not comfortable with. If you'd rather not, just let me know."

Draco shrugged, meeting Bill's gaze. "Apparently Potter and Granger think I should join the Order."

"Wait, you're going to join the Order?"

"I'm thinking about it, or rather, I think I'm stalling. Once I finally own up to it, I'll let you know, and then you can fill in your parents."

"That's great," Bill grinned, absolutely enthused. He stopped smiling. "Why do you look so terrified?"

"I'm not terrified," Draco scowled. "I'm bloody nauseas. Just the idea of being stuck in the same building with you sodding do-gooders is enough to make anyone ill."

"Is it really that bad? I mean, do you really hate them that much?"

"I don't hate them, I hate…," Draco trailed off.

"You hate the idea of trusting other people," said Bill. "Especially ones that haven't exactly been civil to you."

"To say the least."

"You'll get through it though."

"Yeah, but I may end up in the psych ward of St. Mungo's."

"We aren't that bad."

"You're biased."

"Point."

Draco smirked.

When night came, Draco was surprised to find that he was actually tired. The last few days had been trying, but he just assumed that his body would recover as quickly as his mind had. Still, Pomfrey was pleased that he didn't object to the lights dimming and that he even settled back, intent on sleeping the night through. The quicker he caught up on his sleep, the quicker he could leave.

He was jerked out of sleep by an ear-splitting alarm and he almost jumped out of his bed. He managed to reach the curtains and pull them back to reveal the convulsing form of Ron Weasley while Arthur Weasley tried to hold him down, calling for help.

Pomfrey had an amazing reaction time, arriving at the scene in less than twenty seconds and already calling down half a dozen diagnostic spells and grabbing the black bag of potions that was right beside the bed. The black bag contained potions for life or death situations.

Draco couldn't quite make out what was going on because the light was dim, and because Pomfrey's back was to him. Still, he knew that it wasn't good. It took a full half an hour before Ron was deemed stable again and Pomfrey finally stepped back.

She drew Arthur Weasley to the side and Draco could just make out the low murmur of her voice, but it wasn't necessary to hear the words. Mr. Weasley stumbled back a step, losing all color in his face.

"No," he said, voice raised in denial.

"Arthur, I'm so sorry, but we're losing him," Poppy's voice was louder now too, trying to call the father's attention back to her words, and not dwelling on the fact that his youngest son was dying. "I'm going to set up a clean room in here, in hopes that the sterile environment might be enough to pull him out, but the prognosis isn't looking very good. I'm sorry."

"What does that mean? Clean room?"

"I'm going to start around Ron's bed, using spells to sterilize the entire area and work out from there, putting up a magical barrier as I go. I'm going to have to include this whole room, because the infirmary was designed to take the Healer's barrier and maintain the shield itself once it reaches the walls. Because of this, I can only allow one visitor at a time to come in from the outside, and not for very long."

"Can someone stay in the field?"

"Yes, but I wouldn't advise it. The person would have to stay here the entire time, and if that person left, they couldn't come back in. You shouldn't stay here because your family needs to stay together right now. It's for the best this way. If this doesn't work, and when…when it becomes obvious that he's fading, I'll drop the barrier, and all of you can visit him."

Arthur swallowed hard, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose. He stayed like that for sometime, trying to maintain his composure, but when he spoke again, his voice was strained.

"Alright. Let me just…let me tell him that we'll be visiting as often as we can."

"Of course."

The Weasley patriarch crossed to Ron's bed and grasped his hand, whispering to his son before leaning down to kiss him on the forehead. He nodded to Pomfrey and then began walking out. When he glanced up, his eyes met Draco's gaze. His expression was unreadable, and Draco watched him exit the room.

"Draco," said Pomfrey, "do you understand what the barrier means? If you're released before the shield is down, you can't come back in."

Draco nodded. He didn't care about returning; the shield meant that he was going to be very alone for the next few days, locked in a room with a dying Ron Weasley.

He lay back down as his mind started running through different scenarios. What if he had just left with the others? What if he hadn't been so obsessed with striking a blow at Voldemort? What if he had just gone in the safe house in the first place? To be sure, the Ministry ambush had been a clear success, but was the capture of nineteen Death Eaters really worth the life of the youngest Weasley boy, brother to Bill? He could have just gone to the Order and pulled the Horcrux out with their help, and then pulled out Sirius Black. How hard would that have been?

He closed his eyes, knowing that there was no way he could have foreseen the events that had led to this, but at the same time, the knowledge did not make him feel any better. The thoughts plagued him into sleep.

The next day was hell. Draco was restless, wanting to get up, but knowing that he should wait another before testing his ankle. He was incredibly grateful that Bill had brought him the books, because without them he really would have nothing to do while one member of the Weasley family was admitted for twenty minutes at a time before another hour had to pass before the next one came.

Draco had Pomfrey close the curtains around his bed before any of the red-heads came in, not wanting to see their faces or meet their gazes. Ginny spent a few moments to say 'hi' to Draco, but she wasn't the usual witty conversationalists she usually was, and kept drifting into silence. Draco hadn't known what to say either, and so they had sat in quiet.

Bill came in later that afternoon, spending half his time with his brother before slipping through the curtains around Draco's bed and sitting wearily in the chair. It was worse than the time when Ginny and Ron had been injured by the Death Eater attack, and Draco was slightly worried that he would say something to make Bill storm off again, or erupt in a fury.

Still, when a minute had gone by and Bill had said nothing, Draco had to speak.

"How are you doing?" he asked.

Bill ran a hand through his hair. "Not good."

He looked like hell too, but Draco wasn't going to say that.

"I'm sorry," he said, but whether he was apologizing for being one of the agents that had sent Ron into a coma, or just apologizing in general, he wasn't sure. Bill obviously thought the latter, because he gave a sad smile.

"Thanks," he said. "It's just…he's too young, you know? I still remember him when he was knee-high and running around in his nappy." Bill gave a little chuckle and Draco nodded.

"Are you going to be okay?" he asked.

"I, uh, I don't know. This is the first time anything like this has happened, a death in the family, that is. I don't know what to do." He looked up at Draco. "How did you manage? With Lukas? You were young, do you remember?"

Draco paused. "I don't forget," he said finally. "They say that everything has a catch. You want to be capable of remembering everything you see in a book? Well you're going to remember everything you see in your life, and everything you hear and everything you feel, and every day that you live is perfectly clear, like it was yesterday. So yeah, I remember, and I remember that I didn't manage, or I haven't yet. I can't forget, but I can crowd things out easily, turn to something else, to passing the first eight years of Muggle school in the space of two months along with learning Italian. That's how I survived it."

"So I'm pretty much screwed then?" asked Bill.

Draco shook his head. "You've got your parents, and the rest of your family. It'll make it easier when they're near you. At first you'll alternate between rage, devastation, and complete numbness, but after a while, you'll be able to talk about him again. And you'll manage that way, and work things through and come to conclusions about the world and fate and life. And then, eventually, you'll start to forget. A few things you'll remember as clear as day, but the way he looked, how his voice sounded, will just be a vague memory, something you can't put into words. He'll be a pleasant haze to think back on, and you may be sad when you do remember, but you will also smile."

Bill stared at him. "I don't want to forget."

"But it's better that you do."

"Not right now, though. I can't right now."

"Hold onto the things that meant the most to you. Let the others go."

"He could never keep quiet. And he beat me in chess when he was six. He was always…loud and not exactly tactful, but he meant well. That's what I want to remember."

Draco nodded.

"You know, he saved Laney's life," said Bill suddenly. "He jumped out from where he was hiding so that Laney could get out. McGonagall told me and I thought, well, I thought you would want to know."

Draco stared, and then nodded.

"Bill, it's time to leave," said Pomfrey.

"I'll see you tomorrow," said Bill. "And thanks."

Draco watched him leave and then sank back on the bed. He hated thinking about Lukas because he really could remember everything about his brother. He could remember his face, and his voice, and the way he always threw his head back when he laughed. He also remembered his death in the sun-parlor, and how, when he finally hit the floor, he was still smiling but his bright blue eyes were dimmed. Draco remembered shock, incomprehension. He knew what the Avada was; he knew that his brother was dead, but he just couldn't understand.

He had screamed, frozen in place, and then he had been choking on sobs that he couldn't cry. Lucius had glared once at his mother, and Draco had known then that the woman hadn't long for the world, and then Lucius was picking him up, holding on just as tight as Draco was clinging to him, and they were leaving the room. And Lucius hadn't let go, not until Draco had fallen asleep, his face still unmarked by tears.

And now he knew that Ron had saved Lukas' daughter, and now he was going to die. Draco rolled onto his stomach and buried his face in his pillow. He didn't eat when Pomfrey brought him dinner and he only concentrated on keeping his thoughts blank. He fell asleep early in the morning.

He was surprised to get a letter in the morning from Sam, but he didn't think anything of it. He assumed she was just writing because they couldn't visit again, because of the barrier, and so he waited until breakfast to open it.

Draco,

I do hope you are feeling better. I'm writing with some bad news. Our house in the Muggle neighborhood was burned down last night and there was the Dark Mark cast above it. Everything was completely destroyed and a note was found in the mailbox, saying that if Laney tried to go back to school, she would be killed.

They are targeting her specifically now, and although I have kept the news from her, I think she might suspect. She related to me that she understands the racism so prevalent in this wizarding society, and that she is one of the more obvious examples of a Half-Blood. I can't have her live like this, and I know that you will understand.

Laney and I are moving to the States. The conflict has not reached America and I am reassured that they have nothing against Muggle-borns and Half-bloods there. We are leaving today, and I am sorry that we could not say good-bye in person, but I am told that the Weasley boy is dying, and so it did not seem right to take up his family's time.

We will be living in Virginia, and I already have a job and an apartment. Please come visit us for Christmas.

With all my love,

Sam

Draco stared at the letter in his hands before setting it aside. He sat back against the headboard, pulling his knees up to his chest and circling his legs with his arms. It was odd. He had been so elated over the summer to be on his own, without a family to concern him, to tie him down. Now he was dreading that feeling of detachment.

He closed his eyes.

To say that things had been rough was an understatement. Bill was making himself sick with Flooing back and forth between Hogwarts and home. He usually spent evenings and nights with Fleur in their house, after all, his wife was going to have a baby in the next month, but he would get up in the morning to Floo over to the school to check on Ron and the rest of his family.

If there was no change, he would Floo back home to make breakfast for Fleur, who would insist that she could make breakfast herself and that she should spend time with his family, but Bill wanted some semblance of normalcy. Then he, and sometimes Fleur would Floo to the school again right after lunch and spend the afternoon and evening there, finally going home to sleep.

Now that the barrier was set up though, Bill was staying more often at the school, even though he only got to see his brother for twenty minutes a day.

His mother was inconsolable, but he thought that his dad might be taking it worse. He was white-faced with circles under his eyes and he hardly ever ate. Charlie was taking care of them both as best he could, and even Percy had stopped by for a visit, but the relationship between them was still strained. Fred and George were spending massive amounts of time with Ginny, who they were convinced needed their help in coping, but they needed her as well.

It was the second day of the barrier. Bill hated it. He just wanted to be able to stay with Ron and believe that his family's presence was enough to pull the boy away from death, but he knew it was irrational.

He got to visit Ron in the early afternoon, and he spent the first half of the time sitting by his brother's bed, holding his hand. He didn't say anything because he didn't know what was appropriate. Did his brother know what was going on? Could he even hear him? If he could, would he understand? Bill didn't know, so he just sat there.

He then went to the curtained off bed and pulled back the fabric. Draco looked up at him from where he was buried in the string theory book.

"Hey," said the blond, putting the book down.

Bill sat in the chair, feeling tired and completely exhausted. He knew Draco was studying him, but this time the blond remained silent.

"He's getting worse," said Bill. "A few days, if even that."

Draco nodded. "How's your family doing?"

"They're handling it. Some worse than the others."

They lapsed into silence, and then Bill realized that Draco's expression was more than feeling empathetic.

"What's wrong?" he asked.

"What?"

"You looked concerned."

Draco hesitated, and Bill almost wished he would say that something was the matter, if only so that he could concentrate on someone else's troubles and not his own.

Draco shook his head. "It's nothing," he said.

He was lying, but Bill knew that when he decided not to say something, when he really decided, no amount of pressure would get to him to cave.

Bill got up when Pomfrey came over.

"Take it easy," he said.

Draco nodded and then Bill left the barrier to join his family once more.

Ah! The tension! Again, sorry for the wait and the next chapter will be up on schedule. Please leave a review!





25. A Save, a Scar, and a Summons

Disclaimer: If I owned Harry Potter I would be have a lot of fun this summer. I don't own Harry Potter so I'm doing pretty much nothing.

Sorry, I've no time to answer reviews here because I've got to pick a friend up and this week I actually want to make my deadline for this chapter.

It was night.

This night was more of what Draco was used to because he found it difficult to sleep. He wondered if it was because he was finally recovered from his ordeal or if it was simply because he had a lot to think about and his mind refused to quiet.

He was unable to refrain from glancing over at Ron Weasley every now and then, to reassure himself that the boy was still alive. After today's revelations, well, Draco didn't want Ron to die, not when he owed the Gryffindor for saving Laney.

He sighed when sleep remained elusive still and then sat up in bed, wondering if Pomfrey would notice if he turned on the bedside light to read. If she did, she would no doubt come out and give him a sleeping draught. He kicked off his blankets and tried to find a comfortable position, but it turned him back to Weasley. There was a light on over the boy's bed, and the yellow tinge made the red-head look even sicker.

Draco sat up, swinging his legs over the bed and putting his feet on the cold floor. He slowly got up, testing his weight on his ankle, but besides emitting a dull ache, it seemed fine. He crossed over to Ron's bed, feeling as if he should at least say something before the boy slipped away entirely, but standing by the bedside just made him feel like an executioner.

He turned away, but his eyes caught sight of the diagnostic clipboard beside the tray full of potions. He picked it up, and flipped back the cover page, glancing down the list of symptoms and failed cures.

The witness, McGonagall, said that he had been hit by a reddish-purple light which had curved as it was sent so that struck him straight in the heart. It was the Sanguis Curse, which self-targeted the heart where the dark magic took hold. The curse spread through the blood, which then carried the dark magic to the organs and other body tissue, slowly shutting the entire body down. It was like a magical bacteria. The Healers had tried several infusions of Galway's Potion, and when that didn't work, the more potent Hart's stimulant along with a powerful wakening spell, in hopes to jump start his system. They had tried that a few times, but again, nothing.

Now the barrier was up. Sometimes, when the environment was clean enough, the body could fight the bacteria itself, drawing from the pure magic field, but it was apparent, in Ron's case, that he couldn't even begin to do so.

Draco frowned, re-checking the chart. That wasn't right. The only way Ron would be completely unaffected by the clean room was if he was too far gone, which meant he should have died already, within the first half hour of the field in fact, give or take three minutes. No, something was very wrong here.

Draco sat in the bedside chair because his feet were getting cold and checked the rest of Ron's chart. There were a few other pages that detailed separate injuries. Ron had suffered from a slight concussion and a few mild bruises. The last page detailed slight nerve damage due to the Cruciatus curse, and he had been given a regenerative potion.

Draco stared at that last bit, knowing that this was important, but not knowing exactly how right now. He closed his eyes and called up the chapter on the Cruciatus that he had read in the Medical Significance of Dark Curses. He had read it several years ago, but he could see the pages in his head. He saw the paragraph he needed now and honed in on the sentence. Applied on children and teenagers, this curse can cause swelling in the blood, inflaming the cells, lasting for several days if untreated.

Draco's eyes snapped open. That was it.

Ron wasn't hit by the Sanguis Curse; he had been hit by the Aeris Curse, one which was also a reddish-purple color. This dark magic 'virus' latched onto the blood cells, rendering them incapable of carrying oxygen by slowly draining the cells and finally taking over them completely. A hit to the leg or arm may not be fatal, because it couldn't spread as quickly and there was more time to get to the Healer, but a direct hit to the heart or lungs, a large, central area for blood, death could occur in a little over a day.

However, Ron had been hit by the Cruciatus which had been known to inflame the blood in teenagers and children. That side effect would linger in the blood and would no doubt interfere with the Aeris curse, making it harder to drain the blood cells. That was why Ron's organs were slowly shutting down, not due to a virus attacking them, but because now the Aeris Curse was finally taking over having won the battle with the swollen blood cells.

There were two very different treatments for each curse. A blood replenishing potion would only cause the Sanguis Curse to spread faster and farther while it was vital for a person under the Aeris Curse to have a constant supply of fresh blood along with several infusions of a blood disinfectant over the course of twenty-four hours. Of course with Ron's condition, it was just best to do a complete blood transfusion.

"What are you doing out of bed?"

Draco looked up to see Pomfrey bustling over to him, face set in a disproving grimace.

"Curing Weasley here," said Draco. "You need to start a complete blood transfusion sometime in the next hour or so if you want him to live."

"What?"

Draco handed her the clipboard. "He was misdiagnosed. The Aeris Curse is also the same color. My suspicion is that the Cruciatus he endured caused his blood to inflame which held off the curse for so long, but now it's taking hold of him. He's dying not because of a magical bacteria but because his body doesn't have enough oxygen."

Pomfrey took the clipboard from him. "Minerva saw the curse curve to hit his heart. Only the Sanguis does that."

"It is possible to throw a curse on a curved projectery much like it's possible to throw a ball on such a course. Chasers do it all the time in Quidditch. Hitting Weasley in the heart was just a coincidence. If you test his blood, no doubt you'll find that he is oxygen deprived, and has been for a while."

Pomfrey studied him. "It makes sense," she allowed. "But a team of Healers from St. Mungo's diagnosed him."

"They've been wrong before. Besides, the Sanguis curse is hard to cast. I don't know of many Death Eaters who even know of it, much less practice it. Aeris is easier, more common. He needs a blood transfusion."

"A complete blood transfusion is an extremely risky procedure."

"You already have the clean room set up."

"I'll have to tell Arthur and Molly before I start-,"

"No."

"No?"

"Don't get their hopes up. Legally, you don't have to inform them if the situation is critical enough. When they come in tomorrow, just tell them that you're trying something new."

"If I start the blood transfusion, they won't be able to come in. The risk of infection is too high."

"Even better."

"They won't be able to say good-bye if it doesn't work."

"If it doesn't work, there'll be enough time to bring them in."

"You just don't want them to know that it was your idea."

"Of course not. I could kill him if I'm wrong."

"I'm the Healer."

"But I convinced you."

Pomfrey hesitated. "I'll run the diagnostic on his oxygen levels. If you're right, I'll start the transfusion. Right now thought, you're going to go back to bed before you catch cold and if you've even strained your ankle, I'm going to keep you here for another two days."

Draco nodded and then crawled back into bed. Pomfrey closed his curtains and he stared up at the ceiling, listening to the sounds of the instruments. He was sure he was right; he just didn't know if he wasn't too late. He turned over and tried to get comfortable. He drifted off a few hours later.

Draco was woken in the morning because Pomfrey wanted to check his ankle. It was mostly healed, and she even allowed him to walk around the room for a little while before breakfast. He went straight to Weasley's bed, already noting that the boy was breathing easier and there was more color in his face.

"What's the prognosis?" he asked.

"You were right. His blood oxygen levels were severely depleted. As long as the procedure goes smoothly, I expect a full recovery. He'll wake up in a day or so."

Draco raised an eyebrow, not expecting that. Pomfrey smiled.

"He wasn't as bad as we thought. Well, that is, we thought the Sanguis was bad, but the actual Aeris hadn't run too far. You caught it in plenty of time."

Draco nodded and then smiled when the nurse looked away. He felt…relieved.

He was almost content to stay in the infirmary bed all day, at least, he was until after breakfast when Pomfrey pulled the bandages off his left arm and they could see how well it had healed.

Draco didn't exactly know what he had been expecting, but the wound still looked ugly. The swelling had faded, as had most of the discoloration but a few of the bruises still remained. The wound itself was healing nicely, the flesh closing together so that there was no longer a hole through his arm, but it was still ugly. The dark red scab ran in a jagged line on both sides of his arm. It would have been a simple cut clean through, but the Dark Lord had jerked his arm twice, and that had made the wound contoured in a way that looked incredibly serpentine. It could easily be a snake slithering towards his wrist.

Pomfrey apparently came to that conclusion as well because she looked up at him.

"I suppose it's a good thing you're in Slytherin," she said, smiling slightly.

Draco nodded roughly, but in truth, he didn't look at it so innocently. He had denied the Dark Lord and refused the Dark Mark. For all of that, for all of his planning and scheming and choosing, for all of the time spent changing his mind and talking with Bill, and he still had half the Dark Mark. The only thing missing was the skull. It wasn't fair.

He had a sudden urge to rant to Bill, who would say something comforting, or tell him it was merely coincidence, but then he remembered that Bill wouldn't even be coming in today because of the blood transfusion. They couldn't risk a contaminant in the Weasley's transfer.

He also reminded himself that Bill did have a brother who wasn't cured yet, and the complete blood transfusion wasn't exactly the safest of medical procedures. It wouldn't be fair to mention something so trivial and then expect sympathy. And besides, he didn't want sympathy. He hated it. He just…wanted to be able to speak with Bill, or even have Sam or Laney visit him to get his mind off of it, but they were in the States by now.

He drew his thoughts back to the present when Pomfrey finished cleaning his arm but then made no move to rebandage it.

"I just put some disinfectant and anti-bruise cream on it, but it needs to stay unwrapped for a day or so," said Pomfrey, and then she gathered her potions and went to put them away.

Draco clenched his jaw at that. Was he supposed to look at his arm for the entire day then? He was suddenly grateful that no one else was going to be allowed in the room. He would hate for anyone else to see it besides him.

He reached for a book, and invariably his eyes were drawn to the dark red scabs and fading blue bruises on his pale arm. He forced himself not to think about it but every time he turned a page, and every time he lifted the fork to his mouth when eating lunch, he focused on what was going to be a very serious scar.

The afternoon dragged by. Although the barrier was up, he could sometimes hear the Weasley's outside he infirmary doors. Pomfrey had sent them a letter through the Floo, saying that they would not be able to visit due to a new procedure she was trying on Ron, but they had still gathered to wait outside the doors anyway. Sometimes their voices would get loud, but usually it was when one of them was exclaiming 'Fred!' or 'George!' or both at the same time.

Towards evening Pomfrey tested Ron's blood again, and smiled.

"Oxygen count is basically normal," she told Draco. "We'll give him another replenishing potion along with the disinfectant, and perhaps another dose of both in the night, and then he should be waking up sometime afterwards. I'll have to keep him here a few days for observation, but he'll be fine. You saved his life."

"It just means we're even," said Draco.

After giving Ron the two potions, Pomfrey sent another letter through the Floo to the Headmaster's office where Dumbledore could relay the news that Ron appeared to be improving and, if everything continued going so well, he would make a full recovery.

Draco and Pomfrey knew the exact moment the Weasley's received the news because there was an explosion of laughter, cheers, and battle cries outside the infirmary doors. Draco assumed the latter were from the Weasley twins.

He was pleased that Ron would survive, but the ache in his arm kept him from being content. The knowledge that Laney and Sam had left was hard to handle as well, and for the first time in a year, he felt very much alone.

He was glad when night fell and he could stare into the dark and not see the scar on his arm, but for some reason his equations and theories weren't as distracting as they once were. He tossed and turned for a while until Pomfrey handed him a sleeping draught. He took it without complaint.

He would have slept longer, because when he did wake up, even though it was morning, he was extremely groggy, meaning that he hadn't quite slept off all of the potion, but someone was coughing and they wouldn't stop.

Draco scowled and sat up, pulling his curtains back to see Ron Weasley coughing as he tried to sit up in bed. Draco got up and crossed the floor between them. He picked up a purple potion and poured out a capful, handing it to Ron.

Ron stared at it in askance and Draco rolled his eyes.

"I'm a genius, remember? It's not going to kill you."

Ron took the potion and downed it, grimacing at the taste but his coughs subsided and he stared at the infirmary for a bit before turning to Draco.

"You escaped," he said.

"Yeah," said Draco.

"How long was I out?"

"A week or so."

"Oh."

Ron pushed himself up a bit before turning to Draco again.

"How's your…," he trailed off when he spotted Draco's left arm, the damage speaking for itself. "It looks like a snake," he said.

"Yes, thank you for that."

Ron frowned. "You're a Slytherin. Shouldn't that make you happy?"

"Oh yes, completely ecstatic that the Dark Lord ran a knife through my arm just so I could have a scar," said Draco scathingly.

"That's not what I meant," said Ron. "I meant, well, at least it's a snake, right?"

"Yeah, and all I need now is a skull tattoo to go with it."

Ron's eyes widened in understanding. "Oh."

"Yeah. So how exactly did you think it could be worse?"

"Well," said Ron slowly, as if he was afraid of offending him, "a lightning bolt would be worse, right?"

Draco blinked, and then he snorted. "You may have a point," he conceded.

Ron grinned and then frowned. "Where is everyone?"

"You're awake!" Pomfrey hurried over to Ron's bedside. "How are you feeling, dear?"

"Alright, I guess," said Ron.

"I gave him a cough suppressor," said Draco.

"Were you coughing?" asked Pomfrey.

"Uh, yeah," said Ron. "It's really dry in here."

"That's the magical barrier," said Pomfrey. "We had to keep all the contaminants out while we gave you a complete blood transfusion."

"Oh," said Ron, clearly not knowing what it entailed but finding that it sound rather impressive.

"Your parents are downstairs eating right now with the rest of your family. They couldn't come in because of the field but as soon as I release Draco, he can go get them for you."

"I'm leaving?" asked Draco, finding that the news was quite exciting actually.

"You have some clothes by your bed, so as soon as I wrap your arm you can change and I'll take down the barrier. Let's see how your arm is doing." Pomfrey examined his arm, before nodding decisively. "It's healing nicely, but you'll have a bad scar. I'm afraid there's not a lot that cosmetics can do with this though. The burn is just too severe."

Draco nodded, already having suspected that and then Pomfrey rewrapped his arm in white gauze. Draco retreated behind the curtain to change, and once he had pulled on the school-issued black trousers and white button-up that was most likely taken from his room by the house elves, Pomfrey let him leave. He first took the books Bill had given him to his room and then headed down to the Great Hall.

He pushed open the door and entered unnoticed by the large red-haired family that was seated around the table. Harry and Hermione were there as well, neatly incorporated in the conversation and laughter. Said conversation and laughter stopped when Draco approached and they finally noticed him.

Every head turned in his direction and he found it somewhat unnerving, but he approached the Weasley patriarch, as his mannered upbringing demanded, and he gave a nod.

"Mr. Weasley, Madame Pomfrey sent me to inform you that your son has woken up and that he is able to receive visitors at this time."

"Thank you," said Arthur, even as the entire table jumped to their feet and ran for the door.

Draco nodded again and stepped back to allow the family to rush by. Bill ran over to him before darting out the door though.

"You're released?" he asked.

"Yeah."

Bill smiled. "Stick around. We'll have to catch up. I'm gonna run now though."

"Go," said Draco.

Bill grinned and ran to catch up with the rest of his family. Draco raised an eyebrow at the half-full plates left lying on the table and then left as well, but walking up to his dormitory which held all of his belongings. He needed to pack so that he could leave this place.

He entered the Common Room and trudged up the stairs into his room. He was not expecting to see the large Ministry owl sitting on his desk.

He crossed to the desk, taking the letter and immediately the owl left. Draco slowly fingered the smooth cream parchment, already knowing what the letter was going to say before he flipped it open and read the return address, The Bureau of Legal Affairs, subcategory Wills, Testaments, and Family Repute.

He sat heavily in his armchair and opened the letter, reading the message with a detached calm.

To Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy,

As ordered by the ranking authority in your family, Lucius Abraxas, you are no longer to be acknowledged as a member of the Malfoy family and are hereby renounced both legally and economically. You have legal right to withhold the name Malfoy as your own, but are to claim no connection with the latter family and corporations. The Bureau of Heritage and History has been informed of your disownment and has thus recorded it in the genealogies.

Lucius Abraxas has informed us that you are a bearer of the Malfoy signum. Such privilege is hereby stripped from your possession and you are to report to the Bureau of Legal Affairs, subcategory Wills, Testaments, and Family Repute for the proceeding which will relinquish you of such mark on December the Seventh at one in the afternoon.

If this date or time causes any inconvenience to you, please contact the Bureau as soon as possible for rescheduling.

Sincerely,

Edward Thurston

Draco dropped the letter onto the floor and sat back in his chair. His sister-in-law and niece had left, he now bore a scar from Lord Voldemort, more people than he was comfortable with knew that he was a genius, and now his father was legally disowning him. He felt numb.

Draco got up and pulled off his shirt, turning around and straining to see the signum on his back, knowing that in a few days the blood-red ink that depicted the two rowan trees framing the snake wrapped around a sword would be turned coal black, and while now the branches on the trees swayed slightly and although the snake coiled and uncoiled itself around the sword, in a few days, they would fall still. The mark would not just change colors and freeze though; the signum would be slashed through, forever showing the world that he was no longer of the Malfoy family.

He pulled his shirt back on and then packed his trunk for the Christmas break. He knew the right spells and so it only took him a few moments to neatly fold his belongings into his trunk. The school Floo was still down, otherwise he would have sent the trunk directly to his house. As it was, he shrunk his trunk to a ring-box size and pocketed it.

He checked the room over once, just to make sure he hadn't forgotten anything he might need, but he usually didn't. It was one of the perks to being a genius because right now he wanted to leave as fast as possible.

Draco left the Head's room and strode down the hall, intent on nothing more than making it to the carriages outside, but he paused half-way down the main hall. He backtracked and headed up to the infirmary.

He was loathed to enter the room because even from down the hall he could hear laughter and celebrations, but if he didn't tell Bill where he was going, than the Weasley would just look for him and find him, no doubt at a point in time where Draco just wanted to be alone. All he had to do was just tell Bill that he was leaving for a few, and that he would be fine and he could survive the next few days in solitude where no one would pry into his life, or ask him how he was feeling or how he was coping with the shit life was dumping on him at this very moment.

He stepped into the room and spotted Bill crowded with the others around Ron's bed, all of them talking over each other, interrupting a story to correct it or add to it. Draco leaned against the doorway and waited, not wanting to call out to Bill and gain everyone's attention.

Bill seemed to sense his presence because he paused in mid-conversation and looked up. Draco jerked his head to the hall and then left; a few moments later and Bill appeared in the hall.

"What's going on?" he asked with his usual smile, but his eyes were sparkling brighter than usual and he was bouncing lightly on his toes.

"I have to head out for a few days for a family thing," said Draco. "Sam and Laney left." He liked how two unrelated sentences could bring about the wrong conclusion.

"Oh, shit," said Bill. "I heard about that and totally forgot to see how you were doing with them gone. How have you been?"

Draco let a soft sneer slide onto his lips. "Fine, Bill. If you think about it I only met them three months ago really, so I'm fine."

"Well, yeah, but they're family."

A loud burst of laughter caused Draco to tense and glance at the infirmary doors.

"Yeah," he agreed distractedly. "I'll be gone a few days, don't know how many yet."

"Alright, have fun," said Bill. "Keep in touch."

A raised voice made Draco swing back to the doors at the noise. "Sure," he said, distractedly.

"And write if you need anything."

Draco forced his attention back onto Bill and he smiled. "Thanks. See you around."

He left before Bill could say anything more or before Bill could realize that he was on edge. He went straight to the carriages and once he arrived in Hogsmeade, took the Floo straight to his flat.

He had several anti-dust charms on his flat, so that it was exactly the way he left it over three months ago, perfect spotless. He enlarged his trunk in his bedroom but didn't bother to unpack. Instead he went straight to the kitchen, opening up his cupboard and staring at the few bottles of wine and whiskey he had stocked. He swore, shut the door without taking any, and then went to his study, collapsing in the chair behind his desk and staring at the wall.

Bill had run after his family after commanding Draco to stick around before he left for home. He had easily caught up with them because his mother didn't exactly run and no one wanted to burst in before she and their dad got there, and so, grouped together as they were, they barely fit through the infirmary doors.

Poppy approached them as they came in with a smile on her face.

"He just woke up, so he may be a little bit out of it, but he should be perfectly fine."

"Thank you," said Molly, and then they were crowding around Ron's bed as the youngest boy looked up at them all, a faint furrow over his blue eyes.

"How are you feeling, sweetie?" asked their mother, perching on the side of Ron's bed and cupping his cheek with her hand. "You look really pale, do you feel dizzy at all?"

The furrows deepened and Ron's eyes swept over all of them.

"Ron?" asked Arthur.

"Am I Ron? Who are you?" asked Ron. "What's going on? What happened?"

Molly gasped, her hand flying over her mouth and for a second Bill was sure that everyone's heart had just skipped a beat in horror, like his had, but then he saw that Ron's lips were fighting a smile and that his face was turning slightly red with suppressed laughter.

"You utter bastard, Ron," he said, shaking his head and laughing, and then Ron was breaking out into peals of laughter, holding his stomach as the Weasley family and additional members pretended to be more affronted than they were.

Of course, Molly did not find it funny, and she was sure to voice her disproval and frown, but she couldn't stay angry, not when he had miraculously recovered, and so it was only a few moments until she had pulled him into a tight hug. And for the first time in his seventeen years, Ron didn't try to pull away, but he held on as well.

"Look at you," said Molly, finally releasing him and looking him over with a critical eye, "you're as pale as a ghost, and all skin and bones. What have you been eating?"

"Well, nothing Mum, I've been in a coma," said Ron with a slight roll of the eyes.

Ginny pushed past Molly to give Ron a hug, and then everyone was clamoring to pull Ron into an embrace or muss up his hair or slap his back. Bill had chucked his chin, like he had when Ron was a kid.

"You did good," he said.

Ron obviously realized he was referring to telling him Draco's message and he opened his mouth, no doubt to ask about how things had gone, but then Harry and Hermione had come forward, and the friends were talking a mile a minute all about the Death Eater's capture.

It was then that Bill felt eyes on him and he turned towards the door to see Draco leaning in the doorway, completely mastering the nonchalant and unconcerned expression. He could have been in an advertisement. Draco jerked his head to the hall and Bill slipped out, knowing that he was probably still grinning like an idiot.

Draco, however, didn't mention anything about it, which should have been the first clue that something was not right, but Bill missed it. With everything in the world looking up, what could possibly go wrong?

He only half-paid attention to the conversation, not because he was eager to get away, or because he didn't care, but because it is very hard to take anything very seriously when the Order had just scored a major success, Sirius had come back from the dead, and his youngest brother had made a miraculous recovery. Not only that, but Draco was considering joining the Order which meant that Bill could finally come clean to his parents about that as well.

He did think that Draco seemed distracted, glancing to the door whenever the Weasleys were particularly loud, and he didn't have the sarcastic, witty comments that Bill was used to hearing, but he attributed it to the fact that Laney and Sam had left. Anyone would be affected by the departure of family, right?

Still, he frowned as Draco left, watching him walk down the hall before brushing his concern off. Draco was an adult now, even if he did feel that seventeen was a little young to be considered responsible. But, Draco had managed to escape the Dark Lord and pull of the greatest blow to Voldemort since the birth of Harry. He could take care of himself.

He returned to the infirmary, picking up the excited conversation of Harry.

"And that's not the best thing. What do you think Draco did?"

Oh, shit.

The entire Weasley family was listening in with rapt expressions. Bill knew that the last few days had been complete hell on their curiosity. First Bill had run in during the middle of the night carrying the unconscious son of Lucius Malfoy, and refused to tell them why. Secondly, both Dumbledore and Kingsley had consulted with Draco. Thirdly, Draco was being treated in Hogwarts, meaning that he must be in danger of some sort to not be at St. Mungo's. Fourthly, Bill had visited him as had Harry and Hermione, and this was the first time pieces of the puzzle were being put together for them.

"What did the ferret do?" asked Ron, but his voice was light, obviously not holding the same disdain for Draco as he had before. Bill remembered Draco saying that Ron had been present when the knife had been stuck through his arm. No doubt Ron had realized that Draco was truly on their side after all.

"Well, since he was the one that told you about the Veil in the first place, he was obviously planning the ambush," said Harry.

Bill wondered if he could step in and stop the story from being told on grounds that this information should be given out at an Order meeting, and not in the infirmary, but he doubted anyone would actually listen to him.

"Yeah," said Ron. "He had me tell Bill that it was the fourth night and that he needed a coin from the Museum."

All heads turned to him and Bill gave a tight smile, shrugging hopelessly.

"Did he now," said Molly.

"Yeah," said Ron. "Something about getting Voldemort's horcrux from the Veil."

"He was pulling Voldemort's horcrux from the Veil?" demanded Arthur. "He was doing this for Voldemort?"

"No," said Harry. "If he had, he would have told Voldemort about the whole thing."

"But what's this about a coin?" asked Molly. Hermione hastened to explain.

"The ritual needed a coin. See, it was based on the myth that Charon, the boatman, ferries souls across the river. To get the Horcrux back, there had to be payment."

"Why was there a horcrux in the Veil in the first place?" asked Arthur.

Bill groaned and sank into a chair. This was going to be hell to explain.

"When Sirius fell through the Veil," said Harry, "it was because of Bellatrix."

"She," said Hermione, "had the locket that was Voldemort's horcrux, but she didn't realize it."

They had obviously been talking to Dumbledore because they were well informed.

"When Sirius fell," said Harry, "he managed to grab at the necklace, but it broke and so it fell through with him. Voldemort wanted to get it out and for that he needed Draco."

"Why did he need Malfoy's boy?" asked Arthur.

"Because he knew the ritual," said Hermione, neatly glazing over the fact that Draco had translated a set of runes that no one had translated in centuries. "He told Ron about the coin, who told Bill, who told Dumbledore who moved all but one coin from the museum. This way when Draco finally told Voldemort about the coin, they were only able to grab the one. On the fourth night Draco took the Death Eaters to the Veil, but the Aurors knew that they were coming, because Draco told Ron who told Bill, so they had set up an ambush."

"But the Death Eaters warded the doors, so the Aurors had a little trouble getting through," said Harry, taking up the story. "Because of that, Draco was forced to complete the ritual, but instead of pulling out the horcrux he pulled out Sirius instead."

"No!" said Ron, speaking for the rest of the shocked Weasleys.

Harry grinned, nodding like crazy. "He's fine. He's in the hospital for observation and tests, but I've seen him and he's okay. Because Wormtail was captured, he's been cleared."

"Bloody hell," said Ron.

"If Sirius was holding the horcrux, wouldn't it come out with him?" asked Arthur.

"No," said Hermione. "The horcrux is a separate soul in itself and so it needs it's own coin. That was why Draco had only one left in the museum. Voldemort thought that calling out Sirius would bring his soul out as well, but it didn't. I think that Draco didn't want to chance Voldemort getting his hands on it, which was why he called out Sirius and why he wanted only one coin."

"You're saying that Lucius Malfoy's son is in the Order?" asked Arthur.

"Not yet. Maybe later on. He doesn't exactly get along with people well," said Hermione.

Bill snorted at the understatement, but it was a bad move because everyone looked over at him again.

"You seem to have played an integral part in this whole thing," said Molly Weasley.

"Uh, yeah," said Bill. "I guess you could say that."

"But you weren't going to say anything."

"No."

"Because?"

"Because it's not my story to tell," said Bill.

"But you knew about the Malfoy boy being on our side."

"Yes."

"When did you even talk to him?"

"Last year I was his Runes Professor. He was helping me with a few projects and we got to talking."

"About Death Eaters."

"About a lot of things. He's a smart kid; he knew most of it was wrong but he was still working out a few things. I helped him."

"You converted a Malfoy?" asked George.

"Led him to the light?" asked Fred.

"Shocking."

"Startling."

"Didn't think it could be done."

"Knew it couldn't be done."

"But that's our Bill."

"Always trying to save everyone."

"Good job, mate."

"Trying for anyone in particular next?"

"Can we give you suggestions?"

"Is there a form to fill out?"

Bill gave them a look and they stepped back, mock frightened.

"The point is," he said, "it didn't feel right telling you, and I still haven't told you everything because it's Draco's business, and I doubt he wants his life to be spilled to the entire Order."

Arthur nodded. "I understand."

Pomfrey came over then to give Ron a potion and her interruption caused the conversation to once more center around Ron, where it should be, and Bill was relieved that Draco was no longer a topic. He was relieved far too early on.

"You do look rather pale," said Pomfrey. "Still, you're blood was completely renewed, so no doubt it will take you a little while to recover."

"Wait," said Hermione. "I thought you couldn't remove the blood with the Sanguis curse."

"You can't," said Pomfrey. "He was misdiagnosed. He actually had the Aeris curse, which should have killed him in a day, but because the Cruciatus inflamed his blood, the curse took longer to work."

"What clued you into the misdiagnosis?" asked Hermione.

Pomfrey frowned. "I didn't. Didn't he tell you?"

"Didn't who tell us what?"

Pomfrey put the potions she was carrying down. "Draco," she said. "He looked over the chart and figured out what it was."

"What?" asked Molly.

"He knew?" asked Arthur.

"He didn't know," said the nurse, shrugging. "He looked over the chart and re-diagnosed Ron. A second opinion if you will."

"And you listened to him?" asked Molly.

"Don't think you should sound so put out, mum," said Fred.

"Yeah, seeing as the bloke did just save ickle-Ron," said George.

"But still, he is just a boy. How did he-?"

Bill looked around to see that Hermione and Harry were looking away from the Weasley matriarch, exchanging secretive looks. They knew. Ron was becoming captivated with his blankets; he must know as well. Ginny looked as if she suspected it, because she absorbed that bit of information with raised eyebrows and a slight smile.

Charlie caught Bill's eyes, mouthing 'wow' and looking suitably impressed. Bill gave a smirk, because Draco wasn't there to give his own.

Yay! So, yes, Ron lives. I actually planned out a bit of the third story before finishing off this story, and I need Ron for the third, so I never planned on killing him off, I just acted like it (hee-hee!).





26. Falling

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter, but you already knew that, did you?

Author's note: So, it's a little later, and I didn't proof-read the last section very well (cringe), but it's up and the second last until the end. So last chapter last week, and it's not a full length chapter; it's like the last chapter of the first one. So yeah….enjoy the angst!

Moonlight: Thank you so much! I'm glad that your liking the story, but this chapter isn't so great with ending the suspense, so hold on one more week!

Critic: Draco will join the Order. He doesn't want to, not because he doesn't believe in the cause, but because he isn't fond of the people there, but in order to teach him trust. Thanks for reviewing!

Meirta: I love brownies! And yes, it is sad that Laney left and that Bill didn't notice. It will just add to the angst in this chapter.

Dbi626: I can't tell you, because that would ruin the third story. But thanks for reviewing, it's good to hear from you again!

Anti-muppets: Yes, rowan trees are amazing, and yes, poor Draco, but yay! for angst (hee-hee).

Lilith: Yup! Next chapter. The second last of this story (ahh!). Craziness.

RekkaKouyuu: Yeah, I just couldn't kill Ron. It would be mean, and he's needed in the third. I'm glad you're happy!

And thanks to R2D2, Woot!, bena24, Anna, and Freyalyn

Draco did nothing the day before his legal disownment. That is not to say that he purposefully took it easy, or that he had nothing to do, but he couldn't concentrate. He tried to absorb himself in the Runes, trying to get to the first dialect, but after staring blankly at the parchment covered walls, he realized that he hadn't even managed to copy over the second dialect properly and that his handwriting was slanted.

He left his study, closing the door behind him and walking over to his keyboard, but he couldn't even begin to form the simplest of melodies, not even with an abundance of arpeggios and he couldn't make sense of the music books he did have. The notes blended together, he couldn't keep track of all the sharps, and he kept playing the melody with his left hand instead of his right.

He ended up sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall trying not to think about why he was so distracted. He was glad when night fell and he had an excuse to do nothing, but the darkness and the silence were even worse than his distraction. He got up because he hadn't really eaten all day, and made himself a sandwich. Afterwards he sat in his small kitchen, studying the meal and picking at it before putting it back into the refrigerator. He fell asleep around four.

The morning was easier to deal with. Draco had slept in a bit and the rest had helped him more than he cared to admit. He then made a quick breakfast of eggs and toast and actually ate them because he was not going to arrive for the disownment looking pale and unkempt. He was not going to let Lucius Malfoy see that he was in the least bit affected by the disownment.

He showered and dressed, although he did take the time to memorize the signum on his back. It wasn't necessary, because he had a perfect memory, but what he wanted to memorize was the feel of it, the faint brushes of movement along his spine, the soothing, softest whispers in the back of his mind. That was the land he had once been heir too. Now it was forfeit and would be stripped away from him.

He dressed impeccably in neatly pressed black trousers and a white oxford with the thinnest of pale grey pinstripes on it. He didn't bother getting into the charcoal dress robes hanging in his closet just yet, but passed the rest of the morning reading the newspapers for that day and the days he had missed while in the hospital. He wanted to be current on the events taking place and he took comfort in the fact that he had initiated the ambush that had caused so much damage to the Pureblood Death Eaters. He was walking to his disownment, not as a wayward son, but as a boy who was powerful even without the Malfoy family.

The time passed much too quickly, and before Draco knew it, he was sliding on his dress robes, making sure his shoes were polished and checking his hair one last time in the mirror. He then stepped through the Floo and arrived in the Atrium of the Ministry.

It was past the lunch hour, but the lobby was still busy. The Ministry usually was and Draco could attest to that as he had been there quite often on business with his father.

The Bureau of Legal Affairs, subcategory Wills, Testaments, and Family Repute was found on level five with the Department of International Cooperation and so after checking in, Draco took a lift to the fifth level, stepping out along with a few other wizards who obviously worked there because they breezed right past reception and into the office hallway.

"And who are you?" demanded the witch at the desk. She was older, with frizzy brown hair pulled back in a severe bun. She was looking over her glasses at him and the red of her lipstick only annunciated the fact that they were pencil thin.

"Draco Malfoy. I'm here-,"

"He's with me, Regina," said a man appearing from a hallway leading to the right. "When Lucius Malfoy gets here just send him into my office."

Regina made an affirmative noise from behind her closed thin lips.

"I'm Edward Thurston," said the man, who looked to be in his early forties. He still had all of his dark hair though, and it wasn't even beginning to grey. He didn't hold his hand out to Draco, but rather jerked his head towards the hall. "My office is this way."

Draco followed him, knowing from the man's tone of voice that Thurston was one of those men who weren't swayed by money or power and so was not impressed or in awe of the Malfoy name. He was probably one of those men who didn't like Lucius as well which meant that the dislike rubbed off onto Draco as well.

Thurston's office was brightly lit and boasted several colorful, scribbled paintings. Draco determined from the blue stick figures that were the main focus in several of the pictures that Thurston had a wife and two daughters. In one of the pictures the tall stick figure with long hair was looking quite round. His wife was going to have another child.

"Your father isn't here right now," said Thurston. "You can have a seat while we wait."

Of course Lucius wasn't there. It was just another insult on top of the injury. Lucius was showing just how much he did not care for his son by being late to the very disinheritment he had scheduled.

Draco took a seat in one of the matching armchairs while Thurston sat behind his desk, filling out a few parchments. Draco could feel Thurston's gaze on him every now and then but he was determinedly looking away. He realized that his fingers were tapping out their pattern and he forced his fingers to still and let out a silent breath. No sooner had he managed to calm himself, the door opened.

"Mr. Lucius Malfoy," said Regina, and then Lucius was there, sweeping into the room in his fine emerald robes, one hand closed around his mahogany cane, the one with the silver-snake tip and ruby eyes. Regina shut the door behind Lucius with a bang and then Thurston was getting up and turning a few parchments to face Lucius.

"Mr. Malfoy, I need you to sign these."

"Of course," said Lucius, who had yet to look at Draco.

Draco stood, not wanting Lucius to be able to look down on him. When he was standing, they were roughly the same height.

Lucius read the papers before signing them, but when he did put his quill to the page, he signed them with an attitude of indifference and then he turned to Draco, his grey eyes lighting on his son without a flicker of remorse or even recognition.

"This isn't going to take very long, I hope. I have other matters of business to attend to," he said, speaking in his cold drawl with his eyes still on Draco.

Draco couldn't keep his gaze, didn't even try. As soon as his father's eyes had locked onto him, his own gaze was turned to Thurston.

"It shouldn't," said Thurston mildly. "If you will come this way, I have everything already set up."

He led them to an adjoining room, one that was vaguely reminiscent of a private examining room in St. Mungo's. The floor and walls were white and there was a cabinet in the corner holding a variety of potions and instruments. There was also a stool in front of a small, but sturdy table with a few other chairs along the wall.

"Draco, if you would remove your robes and shirt, we will get started."

Draco nodded, unfastening his robes and tossing them over the arm of one of the chairs. His shirt followed and then Thurston gestured at the stool. Draco took a seat, leaning forward on the table as Thurston studied his signum.

"This is one of the more permanent ones," said Thurston, running his fingers over the ink. Draco tensed at the touch. "You can tell because this is actual blood-ink and no spell will actually remove the signum. We can 'kill' the tattoo in a sense, disconnect the magic," said Thurston. No doubt the explanation was necessary for a few patients, but Draco was a genius and Lucius was versed in all things relating to dark magic.

"I will also be including a mark on the signum," said Lucius.

Thurston looked up. "That is in your right. Normally, I wouldn't object, but I feel, as a licensed Healer, that doing so is completely unnecessary. The blood ink in the signum will corrode when the tie is broken and it will turn black and fall silent. That is enough."

"The heritage laws protect my right as patriarch," said Lucius, voice cold.

"Marking his signum will mean scarring half of his back," Thurston tired to argue. "It's inhumane."

"I am more than willing to settle this matter in the courts," said Lucius. "And I guarantee you, they will find the verdict in my favor and I will demand your livelihood in exchange for this inconvenience. I have the right to mark what is no longer my own, and I assure you, it shall be done!" The last few words rang out in the small room.

Draco flinched at the raised voice. His father had never lost his temper. Even when he was at his angriest, he had never yelled, this was…a small comfort. Lucius wouldn't be so upset unless he didn't want to hurt Draco, unless actually marking him hadn't been his idea, would he?

"Very well," said Thurston. He crossed to the cupboard and pulled out a bottle of green liquid and poured a few sips into a disposable cup; a pain-reliever. He handed it to Draco. "Drink this and we'll get started."

Draco reached for the cup without a thought, which meant that he reached for it with his left hand. Thurston pulled away the cup and caught his wrist, staring at the snake-like wound on Draco's arm. It was still healing, so the snake was a dark red of dried blood and on both sides of his arm, accompanied with still fading bruises. That was a testament to the severity of the wound; the location of the injury was a testimony to what the punishment was for.

Thurston stared at the wound before handing the cup to Draco and releasing his arm.

"You know," he said, almost conversationally, "if you wish to testify to maltreatment in your home, I'm sure the lawyers would settle the case outside of court. You could prevent your signum from being marked."

Draco's eyes flickered to Lucius who was staring at Thurston with a very ugly expression on his face. If Lucius looked this murderous at the insinuation of being the cause of the knife through his arm, Draco wondered what he would have don't if Thurston had outright suggested it. Lucius turned, his eyes fastening on Draco's.

Draco stared at his father, reading nothing in the gaze but the warning that Draco shouldn't dare to group Lucius with Narcissa. Draco shook his head, glancing down at the table; he would never compare his father to his mother. He looked back up at Lucius, even as he spoke to Thurston.

"There is no case for maltreatment against Lucius Malfoy," he said evenly. He looked down at the cup in his hand and then down the liquid. He downed it and set the cup aside, turning to Thurston. "You can proceed."

"Very well then," said Thurston. "Lean forward just a bit; this may cause…will cause some discomfort."

Draco leaned onto the table, bowing his head so that no one could see his expression.

"Lucius," said Thurston.

Lucius stepped behind Draco and then the tip of his wand was placed on the top of Draco's spine, pressing down slightly.

"Dimettere mea viscus," he intoned, and Draco automatically translated the Latin in his head. I renounce my flesh.

Ice spread from his wand, down Draco spine. It latched onto the edges of the ink and then spreading over the snake and sword, branching out to grab the trees as well. It was bitterly cold and it caused Draco to fight back a shiver and then Lucius was speaking again.

"Dimettere mea cognatus." I renounce my blood.

This was fire spreading down from the wand, following the same path the ice took, but burning instead of freezing and Draco clenched his teeth, grabbing onto the table as the fire slowly subsided.

"Dimettere mea filius. Mea filius exanima." I renounce my son. My son is dead.

Draco jerked forward at the sudden pain. It felt as if someone was taking a knife and carving out every line of the tattoo, until all that was left was bloody gauges. He clenched his fists, sucking in a breath through his teeth and clenching his jaw even tighter. He was not going to make a sound; he was not going to make a sound….

Lucius stepped back and Draco could feel his back stiffen, as if the ink was constricting, shriveling up his skin until his flesh was pulled too tightly across his shoulders. It was then that he noticed the faint brush in the back of his mind slowly fading away. The comforting whisper was replaced with a throbbing and an over-whelming silence. He gasped.

"You alright, Draco?" asked Thurston. "We can wait a few minutes until marking the signum if you want."

Draco knew that the scarlet ink on his back had turned coal black, and the movement would have stopped. He was officially disowned now and the thought, and the pain, was overwhelming, but he shook his head. He didn't want to drag this out.

"I'm fine," he managed.

"Alright. I'm going to put a disinfectant on your back now, and a localized pain reliever. This might sting a little when it comes in contact with the tattoo."

Draco jerked his head in a nod. Thurston got out another bottle and poured the liquid on a clean cloth. The liquid was then spread over Draco's back and he flinched when it was smeared over the signum lines because it stung worse than alcohol on an open wound.

Draco could hear Lucius stepping forward again and he braced himself as Lucius' wand was placed near the top of his left shoulder.

"Stigmatais," said Lucius, dragging his wand down in a diagonal line until it reached directly below his right shoulder blade.

Draco clamped his mouth shut on a groan, but he sure part of it must have slipped out because Thurston took a step forward, but then thought better of interfering. The curse was a brand, was, in effect, nothing more than a hot poker being dragged across his shoulders and he could feel the blisters forming, the skin on his back burning, and the localized pain reliever really didn't do all that much.

His father's wand was then placed on the opposite shoulder and Draco flinched even though the curse had yet to be spoken. As if afraid he would jerk away, Lucius reached out, placing a hand on the back of his neck, holding his head down and still as he incited the curse and once gain dragged his wand down so that the signum on Draco's back, already blackened and silent, was further marred by an 'X' of seared flesh.

Draco was left breathing heavily, leaning over the table and trembling as he tried to push back the pain and push back the feeling that he had just been uprooted and cut off. His father's hand lingered on the back of his neck for a moment longer than what was necessary, but Draco was too worn to even try to decipher the meaning.

"I'll walk you to the door," said Thurston.

Draco looked up as his father turned to leave and Lucius' gaze locked on his for a split second. Draco wondered how he looked. Adequately haggard and punished or merely just another wizard, no longer of any consequence? His father's eyes were cool, and then Lucius was walking out into the office and Thurston shut the door behind them.

Draco wondered what other people had done in his position. Had they broken down in sobs? Had they stumbled to their feet, screaming at the emptiness inside because they had just been cut off of the family magic? Had they stared blankly at the wall like Draco was doing now, not exactly sure what to do?

It was of no matter. Draco had been disowned, but he was retaining the Malfoy name. He had never been more grateful for inheriting his father's looks as he was right now. Yes, so he was disowned, but no one could ever mistake him for anything less than Lucius Malfoy's son. The thought was strangely comforting and he got up, crossing over to his clothes and attempting to put his shirt back on. It took him three tries until he managed to fight back the pain enough to put the shirt on, and even the light brush of cotton was unbearable.

Thurston opened the door again, looking surprised to see him getting dressed.

"Are you alright?" he asked.

Draco gave him a cold look; what did he expect? Thurston gave a rueful smile.

"If you wait a few more minutes, I'm having the Floo set up in my office so you won't have to go all the way back down to the lobby. It's usually best to go straight home after something like this. Do you have anyone you would like to pick you up?"

For a split second Draco considered having Thurston call for one Bill Weasley, but he shook his head. He didn't want to bother Bill; at least, that's what he told himself. The truth was though, if Bill was there, Draco would be forced to deal with what just happened, be forced to tell Bill how he felt, what his emotions were. Draco didn't know if he could handle that. He just wanted to push it out of his mind, to forget about it. For that, he needed to be alone.

Thurston went to the cabinets, pouring a cup of pain-reliever, a cup of calming potion, and then reaching into the back and pulling out a bottle of whiskey. He poured a cup of that as well and then set them in front of Draco.

"Choose your poison," he remarked dryly.

Perhaps it was because alcoholism does have a genetic factor, or perhaps it was because Draco just really wanted to get drunk at that moment, but he picked up the whiskey and tossed it back, not even coughing at the burn.

Thurston regarded him with a serious expression and then handed him a piece of parchment. "These are some guidelines to follow. Signums are generally not used because of the psychological trauma that can result when the patient is cut off suddenly from a source of magic to which he or she has been connected to since birth. It's best if you have someone stay with you for the next few days, or if you at the very least have visitors or contact with people you can talk to. If at any time you feel depressed or you feel as if you might be a danger to yourself, there are professionals at St. Mungo's you can talk to."

Draco frowned. Was he actually serious?

The fireplace in the office flared up and Draco stood, picking up his robes and following Thurston into the other room. Thurston looked as if he wanted to say something more, but he settled for nodding good-day. Draco returned it and stepped through into his own flat.

The first thing Draco did was to pull off his shirt because he couldn't take the chafing anymore. He then went into his bedroom and rummaged around in his trunk for the few potions he had. He found a pain-reliever and downed it.

He walked into the kitchen and slumped into one of the chairs at the table, leaning forward so he wouldn't press against his back. He stared at the wall, and then, without consciously thinking about it, got up, walked over to his cabinet and pulled out a bottle of brandy. He then fumbled for a tumbler and sloshed some of the alcohol into the cup. He didn't put the brandy away but wandered into his living room where his shirt was still thrown over the couch and where the parchment holding the guidelines was lying discarded on the floor.

He bent down and picked it up, wincing at the pull on his back that was now only throbbing and not burning intensely. He walked back into the kitchen where it was easier to sit without leaning back and again took a seat at the table. He read over the paper as he sipped at the brandy.

It was the usual precautions. Do not take more than two vials of pain-relieving potion in the space of four hours. Do not mix the potions with large amounts of alcohol. When encountering the feeling of displacement or loneliness or emptiness, seek support from family and friends. If the pain persists for more than two weeks, contact your Healer. If at anytime you feel as if you may harm yourself or others, seek attention at St. Mungo's.

Draco tossed the parchment aside, noting that the brandy in his glass was gone. It really was too bad because he could really use some more, but he was not going to become an addict like his mother was.

Instead he lay down in the living room on his stomach and tried to sleep, or do something that would block out the stifling silence in the back of his head. It was painful, the absence of the magic, like a migraine, but he couldn't pinpoint the source of the pain. One moment, it was pounding in the back of his skull, the next it was shooting through his temples, and another it was spiking right through the center.

He knew that another pain-potion wouldn't make it stop; it would only dilute the pressure so that it was even harder to locate, and so he stumbled to his feet and back into the kitchen. He pulled out every bottle of alcohol he had and then stared at them, wondering if the red wine or the whiskey or the brandy would be better at blocking out the pain and confusion in his head.

Remembering a vial of calming potion in his truck, he made his way to his bed room and rummaged through his trunk again. He had, not only a calming potion, but also a few other pain-relievers, an anti-fever draught, and a few sleep aides that he used in cases of emergencies when his insomnia got out of control. He also had two-wakefulness inducers for when he had taken the sleep aides but wasn't able to stay in bed for the full eight hours.

He brought all of them back to the kitchen and piled them with the alcohol. He immediately spotted the combination, the one that was guaranteed to block the pain he was feeling. He stared at it and then left the room, locking himself in his study, telling himself it would never come to that.

For five hours he attempted to block out the thought of the potions on his kitchen table; for five hours he worked furiously on the Persian Runes. His mind was in over-drive, trying to block out the silence of the dead signum on his back and to ignore the pounding in his head that was turning into a migraine.

He was fine until the pain-potions wore off and he had to make his way back into the kitchen to find some relief. He was fine until the emptiness hit him with the force of a runaway hippogriff. He was staring at the potions on the table, remembering a time when Lucius spent night and day with him, bringing him off the drugs his mother had hooked on him. He was staring at the potions, remembering Bill talking about how when he was sick his mother would feed him soup and read him stores. He was fine until he looked around and realized that he was very much alone in his flat and that he had to put some burn ointment on his back sooner or later, but he had no one to help him and he couldn't reach by himself.

His kitchen suddenly morphed into the stone room with the Veil, and he was standing all alone by the curtain, the door locked at the top of the stairs. So many people had gone on before him through the Veil, but he had hesitated and now he was trapped in the room with no one else, just him and his thoughts, and the knowledge that with no one else, with nothing else, his genius would drive him insane within the first week.

He blinked and his vision cleared, and he was once again in his kitchen, but he was sweating and his hands were shaking. There were a few moments when he swore he felt something brush against the back of his mind, but when he tried to connect, when he tried to search for it, all he came up with was a large, dark void.

He grabbed at the wakefulness-inducing potion, pouring it into a cup and then adding a good amount of red-wine to it. He pulled open his pantry doors to find the bottle Muggle aspirin, which he ground with a spell and then added to the cup. He mixed it together and then let it stand.

He pulled out a pot and set it on the stove. He poured in a cup of water, a sleep-aid, and then a good amount of whiskey and a dash of the brandy. He set the burner on high and then watched as the mixture was slowly brought to a boil.

The steam rose off the pot in columns and Draco knew this was a bad idea. How many times had he promised himself that he would never end up like his mother? How many times had he resisted in the past?

Yet still, he watched the liquid in the pot boil down until there was just a thick, silver substance in the bottom of the pot. He turned off the stove and then let the liquid cool. He told himself that he shouldn't do this even as he added the red-wine mixture to the pot, even as he stirred clockwise four times and then rinsed out an empty vial.

He stared at the vial for a long time before gritting his teeth in frustration and walking back to his study. Before he made it into the room he was coming back, knowing he was just damning himself, but right now he didn't care. All he wanted was for the pain to go away, to be able to forget that there was a hole somewhere in his mind, that he was cut off, that he was dead to his father.

He wanted to forget that the Dark Lord had marked him, that his father had marked him, and that Laney and Sam had as well in their own way. He had softened; he had changed because of them, and now they were gone as well, leaving him displaced yet again.

He wanted to forget that he would be joining the Order, that he would align himself with people who hated his father and so who hated him, who had been humiliated by him, and who had humiliated him in turn over the years. He wanted to forget that although he had more money than they could earn in ten lifetimes, they had been the ones to experience a happy childhood with siblings who played with them, and a mother who cooked them meals and taught them to read and a father who wasn't afraid to show that he cared for them. He wanted to forget that although he was smarter than any three of them put together, he still had no idea what love was and the notion still scared the shit out of him. He wanted to forget that the idea of joining a group like that scared him.

And so he picked up the vial and filled it with the purple and silver swirled liquid and he downed it. It wasn't top grade Angel Flight, because for that he would need the finest grade dragon claw powder, not aspirin, and he would need a vintage wine from the 1800s and not a new bottle, but it was good enough.

He blinked as the potion took hold, feeling it wrap around his mind and then lift, and it was as if all of his problems no longer mattered. It was a feeling of euphoria, that he could do anything he wanted, that, in the grand scheme of things, all that really counted was how he felt, and right now, he felt good. No, he felt better than good. He knew right then, nothing was the matter, or ever would be.

He staggered into the living room and collapsed face first on the couch. He stared at the wall as the hallucinogenic properties of the potion took hold. Some people saw colors, some saw shapes. People with a higher level intelligence saw animals and actual objects. Draco saw formulas. Not the actual numbers, but shapes folded in on themselves and contorted. He saw the formulas to right triangles and angles and then as the kaleidoscope turned again, he saw rectangles and circles. He saw pi in his head, dividing through and through, past the hundredth digit and continuing. He saw light reflecting off a prism and he saw the wavelengths of the different colors of light, and he saw electrons shooting around atoms. And as he watched, the rest of the night passed by.

Somewhere in the morning he saw Shakespeare's sonnets in picture form with the words inscribed inside the paintings and that was followed by the sound of Tchaikovsky's Suite number one in D minor, but it was being transposed into A even as heard it. That was followed by a headache.

Draco pushed himself up off the couch, knowing that he was still high, but he would be sobering up in two hours or so. Even now, the desire to go finish off the batch of the drug was strong. He probably had enough in the kitchen to keep him high for five days at least, and the thought was more enticing than he would have liked.

He had to physically hold onto the couch because he was suddenly afraid that he would run in and down another vial full. He nearly ran in anyway because his head was beginning to throb and because the vision of colored lights representing Mozart's seventh piano concerto was fading. As the vision was fading, he lost the feeling that everything no longer mattered and he was once again over powered by a sense of displacement and emptiness.

He slid to the floor, burying his head in his hands as he tried to fight back the migraine, the call of the illegal drug, and the pain on his back and his arm and the pain that was purely psychological. He knew then that he couldn't fight them all at the same time and he doubted as if he could even one at a time. Draco knew what would happen next. He would stumble back into the kitchen and he would take another dose of Angel Flight. He might even wash it down with a glass of wine.

That thought was frightening and Draco did not want it to become truth. He would force himself to ask for help before he lost himself to the drugs entirely. He wasn't going to let himself slip away like that, not when it might be prevented.

Draco pulled himself to his feet, finding a sheet of paper and a quill on his keyboard stand. He scrawled off a quick message, folded the parchment over and wrote Bill Weasley on the front. He tossed it through the Floo to the post office. He had an account there, and they would send it on.

While he waited, he sank back on the floor, his elbows on his legs, his head in his hands. He ran through formulas and runes and orchestral movements, blocking out the thought of the potion, holding onto one thought, that Bill would be there soon and then it wouldn't be so hard.

Ron was released two days after he woke up.

While they waited to bring him home, the entire Weasley family, along with Harry and Hermione, camped out in the infirmary. Sirius joined them the day after Ron woke up having just been released from St. Mungo's.

To celebrate his return, the Order threw an impromptu party which they held in the Hogwarts infirmary because Ron still wasn't allowed out of bed, something which he was finding very trying indeed.

The party consisted of cake, butterbeer, card games, streamers, hats, and a lot of laughter. Everyone also took turns trying to guess the baby name that Fleur and Bill had picked out for their child, but the truth was, they still hadn't decided. However, because Molly Weasley was determined that they should know at least three months in advance, they had told her that they indeed had a name picked out, well two because they didn't know if it was a boy or a girl, but that they weren't saying anything so that no one could critique it and make them change their minds. Molly was satisfied with that and Bill and Fleur were sure that when the right name came along, they would know it. After all, Fleur wasn't named until she was a week old. They weren't exactly in a hurry.

The Order members also delighted in reading the several newspaper articles about Sirius' undeserved imprisonment. The newspaper reporters loved a story like this and they made Sirius out to be quite the victim. Sirius was receiving several dozen letters a day from women who found him to be roguishly attractive to writers hoping Sirius would let them write his autobiography.

"I'm not even dead yet," Sirius would remark to these. "They'll just have to write a whole 'nother book once I'm gone."

"I think that's point," said Hermione, when she finally overheard this comment. "Twice the money that way."

Sirius looked thoughtful. "Well, once you put it that way," he said, "maybe I should make a series of books. Seven books for each of my years at Hogwarts, another two for Lily and James, four during my prison years, and five afterwards."

Those around him had laughed and Snape made a snide comment about each book being two pages each and nothing important in any of them. Sirius had snapped right back. He obviously hadn't lost any of his animosity towards Severus and it was the one downfall of the evening. Bill wished that Draco had been there because he got along with Severus, and he had also saved Sirius' life, so perhaps some form of truce could have been involved, but Draco was away.

Bill hoped he wasn't over taxing himself as well. If anyone had ever deserved a vacation, it was Draco. Well, Snape could use one too right now. Voldemort was incensed at the ambush and at the losses he had sustained and he was taking his anger out on the Death Eaters. Bill knew that if Sirius or Moody or any of the other members that didn't get along with Snape, could see the spy when he came back from a meeting, they wouldn't be quite so cold to him. It was hard to bear a grudge when the man comes back tortured and exhausted and trembling time after time.

Dumbledore was worried too, but he was glad to see Sirius back above all and so he did little to heal the rift. Bill understood that perhaps now was not the best time for it, but still, seeing Severus forced to attend the gala, only to spend it in a corner watching the going-ons with a detached air was not exactly contributing to the festive spirit.

Ginny, however, seemed to note that as well, and to Bill's surprise, walked straight over to the Potion's Master and offered him a cup of tea.

"Is it Earl Grey?" asked Snape, eyeing the girl with slight derision.

"Mandarin Spice," said Ginny.

Snape muttered something about 'it will have to do', but took the cup. Ginny sat herself down right next to the professor, ignoring his baleful stare and merely giving the smile she had used to win over so many people before.

"So," she said, "I was trying to read ahead in the potion's book to get a head start on my studies-"

"Is your last name Granger?" asked Snape.

"It's rude to interrupt," said Ginny, "and I was actually reading ahead because I wanted to know how to make a bonding potion, for one of Fred and George's new experiments, and I was wondering, that guy, what's his name? The one that starts with an 'A' and he came up with the blue potion, the one with the lot of smoke-"

"Aston."

"That's the one," said Ginny. "Anyway, the book says that he's innovative, but he's not exactly smart, is he? I mean, I was looking at the work that he's done, and all he really does is take completed potions and finds different uses for them by switching a minor ingredient."

"Perhaps," said Snape. "But before he took out the one ingredient of the skele-grow to make skele-mend, wizards only used spells to fix broken bones when the potion is much more helpful to hospitals."

"I suppose," said Ginny, "but he doesn't come up with anything on his own."

"And so you have decided that only inventors can be labeled 'smart'? That's quite a decisive declaration for one with no experience or credentials."

"No, I just don't see why he's so big in the potion's world if he only improves potions and never theorizes on his own. There has to be some level of personal thought and theory, doesn't there?"

And Snape was launched in a conversation with Ginny and Bill wandered over to sit with Fleur and hold her hand.

The day Ron was released was hectic as Harry, Hermione, and Ginny had to pack their things as well because they were still living in the castle while Ron recovered. Because the Floo still wasn't up, it involved a lot of carriage trips and tightened security as they Flooed to the Order.

Then, once they arrived, the children had to unpack and the rest of the Weasley family moved back in as well from their temporary station at the Hogwarts infirmary. Too make matters worse, although the Order Headquarters was looking a lot cleaner (it had been completely re-furbished over the summer), Mrs. Black's portrait was still on the wall and this time when she started screaming, the curtain rod fell down. It took an hour until the curtains were closed and she finally fell silent.

It was still quite fun though. Fred and George wouldn't stop playing tricks on the unsuspecting movers, although when Ron fell victim to a trick step just like the one at Hogwarts, Mrs. Weasley came down on them hard. After all, Ron did nearly die just a few days ago, and while he claimed he was feeling alright, his face was pale after the move and he didn't object to being confined to the sofa with a mug of tea and a blanket.

The mood after that was somewhat subdued because the thought of Ron dying was sobering. What was even more sobering, or at least, more sobering to the Weasley parents, was that they owned the life of their son to the son of their greatest enemy, the man who had nearly killed their daughter.

Bill wondered if Draco knew that his father was responsible for nearly getting Ginny killed, and for having the Chamber of Secrets opened. Severus had said that Draco genuinely had no idea about the diary horcrux and Bill hoped that Draco never found out. The kid was confused enough when it came to his father, and although Bill was loathed to admit it, when it came to Lucius' behavior to Draco, he was confused as well.

The Order meeting that night was held around the dinner table. All of the kids were of age, besides Ginny, and the general consensus was that she was bound to find out anyway, so she might as well hear it with the rest of them.

Ginny was quite pleased with that arrangement, although Ron objected somewhat. After his parents being so adamant that he only be involved in the Order when he was of age, it seemed unfair that Ginny was included when she wasn't even sixteen and a half yet. Ginny made sure to flaunt it in his face.

Bill found that he liked the over-dinner Order meetings. To be sure, sometimes it was hard to take things as seriously as they should have been, and sometimes the children got a little noisy when the topics turned boring, but it was much less of a grim, already-defeated atmosphere.

"So there are ten guaranteed convictions of the nineteen Death Eaters, another three that are pretty certain, and two that could go either way and four that will be released because their lawyers are that good," said Kingsley. "Over all, not bad considering."

"Considering," snorted Moody. "Considering what? Considering that we are working with a flawed system. We ought to send them straight to Azkaban without a trial."

"Because that worked so well with Sirius," said Ginny. "No offence, Sirius."

"None taken."

"That's different," said Moody. "He was actually innocent. None of the Death Eaters are."

"But the legal system has to be maintained otherwise there is no basis for justice and the law becomes a tool for one person's revenge," said Ginny. "If it's flaw, we should fix it, but even a flawed system that let's out a few guilty men is better than a system that can be used to imprison the innocent as well."

She had to refrain herself from continuing her rant and then she blushed. "Sorry," she said, as she realized she had just been lecturing a group of adults twice her age, but Dumbledore smiled.

"No need to apologize, Ginevra. It is good to see our young people taking such an interest in our political system. Now then, to the next topic, Bill, perhaps you can answer this. Was Draco Malfoy planning on joining the Order anytime soon?"

"He did express a desire to, but then Sam and Laney left so he's visiting them for a while," said Bill.

Dumbledore frowned. "I just spoke with Sam this morning. She didn't mention that Draco was over."

Bill put his fork down. "Draco said that he was-," he stopped himself and forced himself to take a deep breath when he realized that Draco had never told Bill he was visiting, just like he never said he would personally use the portkey. "Draco actually said that Sam and Laney left and that he had a 'family thing' to attend."

"Ah," said Dumbledore, catching the technicality.

Bill sighed and silently mused that looking after the Slytherin was going to give him grey hair. He then wondered what it was Draco was doing. The only other family he had was…but he wouldn't be doing anything with Lucius, would he? The thought was frightening; he would check in on the boy tomorrow.

"Well, then," said Dumbledore. "If you do figure out where he went, or if he contacts you, let us know when he is ready to join. We look forward to having him with us. And give him this."

Dumbledore handed over a piece of paper with the Order address on it.

"You aren't serious," said Moody. "Lucius' boy? On the Order?"

"Of course," said Dumbledore. "He will be quite beneficial."

Several looks were exchanged over the table, but Dumbledore went on to make a few more announcements. Bill tried to pay attention but more worries about Draco came to mind. What on earth was he doing with his family? Was meeting Lucius for something? Was he speaking with his mother in hopes for information?

Bill did not like the idea of Draco being in contact with his family because it simply wasn't safe. Lucius had allowed his son to be tortured by Voldemort, and there was no telling what else he would do for the sake of Pureblood beliefs and for the Dark Lord.

Bill and Fleur both went home for the night, but Bill found it difficult to actually sleep. He spent the night gazing at his wife and trying to push away the cold fear that was rising in his chest. In the early hours of the morning, he finally drifted off, but he was up again at seven. The Order usually met for breakfast together, not really to discuss business, but just because they genuinely liked each others company. Bill would go to see if Dumbledore had any news and then he was going over to Draco's flat. Something wasn't right. It sounded cliché, but he really could feel it.

Dumbledore had no news about Draco though, but he had spoken to Sam and Draco definitely wasn't in the States. Bill was bolting his breakfast, just wanting to find Draco and see if he was alright when Kingsley arrived, bringing with him the Daily Prophet. Everyone immediately stopped eating when they saw his grim expression.

"I know where Draco's been," he said, and set the paper down in front of Bill.

Bill picked up the paper and read the headline out loud, the cold in his chest returning at the words, "Lucius Malfoy Disowns Only Child." He tossed the paper aside. "Shit."

"So that's his family thing?" asked Arthur. "His father disowned him?"

"Apparently," said Bill, pinching the bridge of his nose. Why hadn't Draco told him?

"It gets worse," said Kingsley. "He has a signum."

Dumbledore set down his cup of tea, his expression apprehensive.

"Did it say anything else?"

"Just that the disownment was announced at the end of last spring and became official yesterday. His signum was deactivated and then marked."

"None of you knew?"

Everyone turned to look at Sirius, surprised that he was interested.

Sirius looked down at his mug of coffee, obviously remembering something.

"I've been disowned," he said, his gaze darkening at the memory. "My signum was marked."

"What happened?" asked Bill.

"I wasn't exactly a model Black so they kicked me out. A year later the paper work finally went through."

Everyone turned as the Floo burst into life and Fleur stepped out, still in her dressing gown.

"Fleur, what's wrong?" Bill asked, crossing over to his wife.

"You got this," she said, handing him a piece of paper.

Bill recognized the handwriting, but he had never seen it so disconnected before. He flipped it open with dread scanning the message.

Bill –

I think I screwed up.

"Shit. I've got to go," said Bill. He gave Fleur a kiss on the cheek and grabbed his wand off the table.

"Is he alright?" asked Sirius and he actually sounded concerned.

"I don't know," said Bill. "What did you do when you had your signum removed?"

"Got completely wasted," said Sirius.

"That's what I was afraid of," said Bill. He threw on Floo and called out the Leakey Cauldron. Draco's Floo was warded; he would have to walk there.

One more to go. Please review!





27. Going Home

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. Though, I'll admit it, I wish I did.

Bill arrived at Draco's flat and knocked on the door.

"Draco, are you in there?" he called through the wood.

He couldn't hear anything and for a second he was afraid that Draco wasn't even there, but then he heard the sound of footsteps and the bolt was pulled. Bill waited for the door to open, but it remained shut.

"Draco?" he called, even more worried than he had been before, which was saying something.

He turned the door knob and pushed open the door. It was morning, but the apartment was dim, the heavy drapes shutting out the sun and leaving the room in shadow. He could see Draco sitting by the couch, not looking up at him.

Bill entered all the way, shutting the door behind him. He came in a few steps, noting that there was a shirt and robe slung over the couch and that a few pieces of parchment had fallen around the keyboard. He looked back at Draco who was only wearing a pair of black trousers and socks.

"Draco?" he asked. "Are you alright?"

Draco said something, and at first he thought it was nonsense words, which scared him, but then he realized it was French. The English equivalent was 'I f-ed up.'

"That's what your letter said. Do you feel like expanding?"

Draco looked up to meet his gaze and Bill took in the wildly mussed hair, the flushed cheeks, and the glazed expression.

"Shit," he said, knowing exactly what had happened. He had only seen Lord Draco once, but he remembered how the Boggart had looked.

Draco laughed, but it was hollow. "The rest of it is in the kitchen. Would you mind throwing it out for me? I would but I think I just might end up taking it."

"Yeah," said Bill. He crossed into the kitchen staring at the assortment of alcohol on the table and then noticing the pot on the counter that held more of the purple and silver liquid.

He picked up the pot and dumped the contents into the sink and then rinsed out the pan, making sure that all the liquid was down the drain. On a second thought he dumped out all the alcohol too, rinsing out those bottles as well.

Draco was still sitting by the couch when he came back, leaning forward, his hands fisted in his hair.

"You alright?' asked Bill.

"Been better," said Draco.

"Where was your signum?" asked Bill. He already figured it was on Draco's back, because most were and because Draco didn't have a shirt on, but he wanted Draco to show him.

Draco turned slightly and Bill felt sick. There was a large, black tattoo centered between Draco's shoulders, sweeping across the majority of his upper back. The signum was artistic and almost pleasing to look at, but the lines were coal black, ugly against the pale skin and there was a large 'X' through the center of it, an 'X' made from burnt skin.

"Do you have a first aid kit?"

"Bathroom."

Bill went to the bathroom, pulling open the mirror cabinet and finding a burn salve. He found a roll of gauze as well and brought those out along with some medical tape.

"Turn around so I can reach your back," he said.

Draco did and Bill spread the salve on the burns, noticing the way Draco was tensed, refusing to let himself flinch. Once he was finished he taped strips of gauze over the burns.

"Thanks," said Draco quietly. He reached for his shirt and pulled it on, but had difficulty with the buttons.

"Are you still high?" asked Bill.

Draco laughed again. "Mozart composes the majority of his songs in blue circles, so yes, I'm still high." Draco frowned slightly. "That actually makes a lot of sense to me."

"I'm sure it does," said Bill. His tone was flat and unimpressed. Draco looked up at him, startled.

"You're mad at me," he said. "What did I do? Was it this?" He gestured to himself, no doubt referencing his incapacitated mind. "I didn't mean too, I swear, I just…," he trailed off and then turned angry. "It's not exactly as if I purposefully decided to get high just for the fun of it. It hurt, and it wouldn't stop being quiet and there was just…nothing where it was supposed to be, and I had to shut it up somehow. Or maybe I had to make it talk. No, I was just trying to forget. Trying to forget it all, so I made something to help."

His anger had trailed off during his aside to himself and now it came back. "It's not like I wanted this! I didn't ask to be an addict, because I'm not. I'm not an addict, just sometimes I slip and I can't help it. And I didn't mean to, alright? I didn't mean to!"

He was getting upset, but unlike all the other times, the anger wasn't growing somewhere inside of him, underneath the ice. No, this time he was actually lashing out and Bill quickly spoke up.

"I'm not upset about this, Draco. I'm upset that you didn't tell me you were getting disowned. I would have helped you; you didn't have to resort to this."

Draco was silent.

"Why didn't you tell me, Draco?"

Draco shrugged, but the motion seemed to pain him. "You were busy with Ron," he said.

"So you didn't want to bother me," said Bill.

"Yeah. That."

"Draco, look at me."

Bill waited until Draco's glazed silver eyes were at least turned in the direction of his. Draco wasn't exactly focusing that well.

"Draco, you are like a brother to me," he said. "I think of you the way I think of Ron and Charlie and all the rest. I want to know when something like this happens to you, alright?"

"Yeah," Draco muttered looking away, but Bill could tell, by the way Draco seemed uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed, the words had stuck.

"So, why didn't you tell me?"

"I already told you," said Draco. "Didn't want to bother you."

"I don't believe that was the whole reason. Come on, what made you lie to me about this?"

"I didn't lie. Just led you to assume."

"Which is the same thing as lying. You deliberately didn't want me to know, so what was the reason."

"I don't know."

"Draco, I will stay right here all day if you don't tell me."

"Because you wouldn't understand!" Draco blurted.

It was another falsehood, because Draco would never utter such a clichéd, teenage expression, but Bill went along with it.

"I wouldn't understand?" he asked.

"Yeah."

"What wouldn't I understand?"

Silence.

"Draco, tell me."

Silence.

"Are you ashamed that you used the drugs?"

Draco scoffed. "I used once. Big deal."

"Big deal? Draco, look at you. You're higher than a Firebolt. You don't even know what you're saying."

Draco grew angry at that remark.

"I don't know what I'm saying?" he retorted. "I'll have you know that even when I'm high on illegal drugs, I'm still three times as smart as you. Do you know what I see when I'm like this? I see mathematical equations and atoms. I hear symphonies being composed into different keys and I see poetry brought to life. I can see what music looks like."

"And yet you had me throw away your drugs because you're afraid you'll take more. If it's so amazing, why are you so scared of it?"

Draco looked away, his fingers blundering through their pattern.

"Look at you, you can't even tap your fingers," said Bill. "You know that this isn't good for you, that you can't think or do anything when you're like this, so don't try to tell me that it's okay for you. Don't try to fool me with that excuse. Tell me the truth."

Draco sighed. "Do you know what Lord Draco said to me that last time I talked to him?"

"What did he say?"

"He said that one day I wasn't going to be prepared to fight the drugs, and that's where he would be. Waiting for that day. You know I'm always right, so he's always right."

"So this was what? Some sort of twisted self-fulfilling prophecy?"

"Something like it."

"Draco, worst fears are supposed to say things like that. Besides, you've spent your whole life trying to prove Lord Draco wrong. Don't tell me that he convinced you."

Draco fell silent again, looking at the floor. Bill sighed and sat down in front of Draco.

"Draco, what was so bad about telling me? Do you trust me that little?"

Draco shook his head, not meeting his gaze.

"That what was it?"

Draco's fingers blundered again through the pattern.

"Draco," said Bill softly.

"I didn't want to tell you," came the quiet answer.

Bill frowned. Why hadn't-? "Why not?" he asked, and some of the surprised hurt crept through his voice. And even when he was high, Draco still picked up on it.

"It's not you," he said. "It's me."

"What's you?"

"If I told you about it, then I would have to deal with it, and I would have to think about it, and I just wanted it to be over."

Bill immediately understood. Draco was so closed off to his emotions, so hesitant to actually open himself up to them, that he would keep himself closed off just so other people wouldn't bring it up, so that he could wrap up the wound and forget about it, so that one stray comment couldn't pick open the scab.

"Draco, you can't keep hiding things like that. You can't just shove things aside and think that it's over because it will just come back and torment you."

Draco scoffed, but Bill pressed on.

"You didn't just get high because you got disowned, did you?"

Draco didn't answer. That meant Bill was right.

"You got high because of a bunch of other things you didn't deal with, isn't that right?"

No answer; Bill wasn't really expecting one.

"You can't keep pushing emotions back like that Draco. You have to face them."

Draco let his head drop to his hands and Bill had to remind himself that although he was ready to have a little heart to heart, Draco was still high and not in a position to listen to a lecture. Even if Draco was sober-minded, it still wasn't the right time. Not now when so much had happened. It was no wonder that the kid, who didn't cope with emotions well in the first place, was so overwhelmed.

He watched as Draco took in a breath and released it. He then stared at something only he was aware of.

"What are you seeing now?" he asked.

"Chemical bonding on the molecular level."

Bill shook his head. "Of course you are. I do have to say though, I think Lord Draco is more of a fun druggie than you."

"He's not going through withdrawal."

Bill frowned, suddenly worried. "Already?"

"I only took one dose, so yeah."

"Is it bad?"

"Not yet, just a migraine."

"How bad is it going to be?"

"Lock me in a room."

"That bad?"

"Yeah."

"Alright then, come on."

Bill got to his feet and then grabbed Draco's arms, pulling him up. Draco swayed once he was standing and Bill grabbed his shoulders, holding him upright.

"You okay there, Draco?"

Draco nodded, but his gaze was clouded again, and not with a hallucination.

"Draco?"

Draco swallowed hard and blinked a few times. His expression remained glazed and he shook his head, obviously trying to clear his mind. That threw him off balance and he swayed again, grabbing onto Bill's shoulder, and Bill tightened his grip in return.

"Hey, you okay?" he asked, not liking the look on Draco's face.

Draco started to nod, but then seemed to think better of it. He shook his head, jaw clenching. Bill stepped closer, wrapping an arm carefully around the middle of Draco's back, underneath the burn. For the first time, Draco actually leaned into the hug, in need of the comfort this time, and too weary to pull away. Bill put all of the reassurance he could into that brief moment and then stepped away, knowing that Draco wasn't one to enjoy extended periods of close physical proximity.

"Are you ready to go?" he asked.

Draco frowned. "Where we going?"

"Home," said Bill.

"Where?"

"Here," said Bill, handing him the piece of paper Dumbledore had given him.

Draco read it. "No."

"What's wrong?"

"I'm high on an illegal potion and I'm going to spend the next few days in a room with a vanishing bucket."

"Exactly," said Bill. "I'm not a medi-witch and I want other people to be able to go for help if something goes wrong."

"Bill, no. I'm not going to go over there when I'm like this."

"Draco, you know how you don't want to contemplate on your emotions?"

"What about it?"

"That's why we have other people. So that when it gets too much, they can help."

"And this is what? A crash course in trust?"

"Something like it."

Draco still didn't look convinced so Bill spoke again.

"Sirius Black was disowned too. When he lost his signum, he got drunk. This is about the same."

Draco rolled his eyes and Bill helped him over the Floo. He threw on a bunch of Floo powder and called out 'Order of the Phoenix Headquarters'.

He didn't know that Draco was thinking, that very moment, of a nightmare he had where he was locked in the Veil room and everyone else had run through, except now it had a happier ending. In this version, Bill had come back through to help him to the other side.

Bill did know, however, that Draco took a breath before he stepped through, and that his grip on Bill's hand tightened.

Hey, sorry about the wait. My laptop, Freddie, broke and I had to take him to the shop. But he's all better now.

And now, the Q and A on the next story.

I don't have a title just yet, but I do have the general outline. The first chapter will be up in three weeks, because I need to take a break. I'm sure you understand. In the next story Draco will be joining the Order and there will be lots of Draco/Ginny moments. Ginny may appear to be slightly cliché in the first few chapters, but that's just because she's got a crush on Draco and will be inserting herself in his life.

Also, Draco will be discovering a code that the Death Eaters are using, there will be a major death, Lord Draco will be making an appearance (because I love writing him), Draco and Ginny will start dating, and…umm, I think that's all I can say so far. A big thank you to all of my reviewers, I love you all! I'm sorry that I didn't respond to unanimous reviews here, but I'm exhausted. Good night!

1. The Withdrawal

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. However, in nine hours I'm seeing the new HP movie (yay!).

Author's Note: Just a quick thank you to all of my amazing reviewers, and here is the third part of my Code Trilogy (applaud now). Remember, I couldn't do it without you all, so thanks again!

Draco stumbled when he and Bill stepped out of the Floo, something he hadn't done in ten years, but Bill was steadying him then and Draco was looking up at the startled faces of a few members of the Order sitting around a large table, obviously eating breakfast.

He couldn't quite make out their faces because he was being treated to the algorithmic equations of a death spiral right then and he found the hallucination rather fitting. Of course, seeing the spiral only threw him more off balance and Bill grabbed him quickly to keep him from face-planting into the wood floor, but in doing so, forgot about the burn on his back.

Draco tried to bite back the cry that left his lips when Bill grabbed him around the shoulders, but half of it escaped and then his vision was tunneling and black spots arose. He was aware of voices around him, but there were too many of them.

"Where's a spare room?"

"What happened?"

"He's the son of a Death Eater!"

"Shut it, Alastor."

"What's the ferret doing here?"

"Is he going to be hanging out with us weasels?"

"Forge, not right now."

"Third floor, I think."

"There's one on second, next to mine."

"What happened to him?"

"Thanks."

Draco felt himself being moved then, but he couldn't be sure if he was moving on his own accord and being guided, or simply carried. Right then, he couldn't care less.

Stairs were ascended, a hall traversed, and then a door creaking open. It was dark, blessedly dark and cool in here, and there was something soft underneath him. A bed. He was set facedown, which he was thankful for, and his arm closed around a pillow. He grabbed it for support as he seemed to follow the death spiral down.

"Draco?"

The voice was familiar, calming. He pushed away the spiral and the equations, turning his head and managing to open his eyes. Bill was beside him, looking worried. Draco was glad he no longer seemed upset; he wasn't familiar with the feeling of guilt and he didn't like it.

"Are you going to be okay?"

Draco managed a short nod.

"Do you need anything?"

"A vanishing bucket."

"I can get you that."

"And lock the door."

"From what side?"

"The side where I can't get out if I want to," said Draco.

Bill nodded and left the room and Draco buried his head in the pillow, trying to block out the migraine that felt as if his skull was shrinking and squeezing his brain.

He mentally swore at himself for slipping up like that. He hadn't just gotten high; he had made the drug. He had thought that being a genius meant that he was smart enough not to do something like that, that he was strong enough to resist it. He had screwed up; he was screwed up.

He clenched his jaw and tried to smother his thoughts in the pillow and then the door opened again.

"Do you need anything else?" asked Bill.

"No," said Draco.

There was the sound of something being placed beside the bed and then the footsteps walked back to the door and it swung shut. Draco squeezed his eyes shut, trying to fight past the self-loathing that seemed to rise up from the pit of his stomach.

He suddenly realized that Bill hadn't locked the door and so he opened his eyes, turning to the entryway. Bill was leaning against the wall, eyes on him, worried. His expression made Draco feel worse and he groaned, turning back to the pillow.

"Don't forget to lock the door," he said.

"I won't need to. I'm staying with you."

Draco turned back again as Bill pulled over the armchair by the wall to Draco's bed. He sat and gave Draco a small smile.

Draco felt inexplicably tired. "Bill," he started, but Bill didn't let him finish.

"Draco, why wouldn't I be here? I've told you, you're like a brother to me, and I'm going to be right here until you're over this."

"What are you going to tell your parents?" Draco asked, trying to find a reason to make Bill leave. It wasn't that he didn't want the help, or that he didn't need it, it was just…he wasn't exactly proud of himself right then, and he didn't want Bill to witness just how badly he had messed up.

"Nothing," said Bill. "They already know quite a bit, and after all, you did just save Ron's life. Speaking of which, why didn't you tell me?"

Draco shrugged. What was he supposed to have said? 'Oh, hey Bill. I just saved your brother's life.'

There was a sudden spike of fire in his head and he flinched, grabbing the pillow with all of his might as he waited for the pain to diminish.

"You okay, Draco?"

"Fine," he managed, once the headache was at a manageable level. "Look, Bill-,"

"Draco," Bill interrupted again, "I get that right now you might not want me to sit with you, but I'm not going to have you face this down alone."

"It's not…," Draco trailed off, not being able to say the words.

Merlin, he was an idiot. What was wrong with him?

The back of his throat was tightening and his eyes stung, but no tears came to the surface. He wondered what it would be like for the sting to actually be soothed away by tears, but he would never know. He buried his face again, trying to keep his breath from hitching, but Bill must have heard it anyway.

"Draco," he asked, voice thick with concern. "Draco, are you going to be okay?"

"I'm fine," Draco ground out.

"You say that too much."

Draco choked on a burst of laughter, raising his hand to his head and letting his fingers entwine in his hair, tugging at the strands.

"Merlin, I screwed up," he muttered as he fought back a bout of dizziness.

There was a small silence and then Bill spoke, his voice concerned.

"You don't think this is your fault, do you?"

Draco didn't answer.

"Draco, this is in no way your fault," said Bill, his tone urgent and convincing.

"Because actually taking the time to make the sodding potion counts as not my bloody fault."

"You wouldn't have even thought to make the potion if your mother hadn't poisoned you when you were kid," said Bill, sounding outraged that he would even think that taking the drugs was his mistake.

"I knew it was a bad idea," said Draco. "I was telling myself not to make it, and not to take it, but I did. How is that not my fault?"

"You have just been rescued from Voldemort where you had a knife shoved through your arm, you decided to join the Order, Sam and Laney left to the States and on top of it all you got disowned and the entire top of your back is burned. Anyone might be driven to things they wouldn't usually do."

"But I'm not 'anyone'," Draco spat. "I'm a bloody genius. I should know better."

He felt the bed dip slightly as Bill sat on the edge of it and then Bill's hand was on his arm.

"Draco, listen to me. Just because you are a genius does not mean that you are invulnerable or that you are unsusceptible to emotion or suffering. You are still a teenager above all and thinking that you should be able to pass through trials untouched is just going to get you burnt. You made a mistake; it's alright. Everyone slips up every now and then. You can't expect perfectionism."

"I just-," Draco cut off because his throat was closing again, but he forced the feeling back. "I don't like…," but he stopped again because he couldn't quite phrase what he wanted to say.

"You don't like having to rely on other people when you do make that mistake," said Bill. "Draco, remember what I was saying about how we need other people? This is precisely for that reason. You got that?"

Draco nodded but then sat up. "I'm going to be sick."

He slid off the bed, knelt over the bucket, and threw up. It couldn't really be called throwing up though because he hadn't had anything to eat in almost an entire day and so all that came up was stomach acid and bile.

His body refused to stop retching until it was certain that everything in his stomach had been expelled and then he leaned his shoulder against the bed, keeping his back from coming into contact with anything harder than his shirt.

"Do you need anything?" asked Bill.

Draco shook his head, feeling the throbbing he remembered so clearly from when he was thirteen settle into his temples.

"Help me back up," he said, holding up a hand. Bill grasped it and helped him back on the bed where Draco collapsed face first. His legs began to ache first, and then it spread up over the rest of his body from there.

He grit his teeth as the ache sank into his bones and every light touch became painful, even lying on the bed made him think that he was going to have bruises from the contact. He closed his eyes, trying to force himself into sleep, but it wouldn't come. Time passed too slowly. Bill tried to start up a conversation a few times, but he stopped when he realized Draco wasn't exactly up to answering him.

He left for a few minutes, and when he came back he had a book which he read out loud. It was just Hogwarts: A History, but his voice was soothing, and Draco finally felt himself drift off. The shivers took hold sometime in the evening.

It started with just a trembling in his hands, but then spread. His head throbbed and it hurt to breathe. His skin broke out in cold sweat as his body trembled.

"Draco."

That was Bill, sounding concerned, almost frightened.

"It's fine," Draco managed.

"Can I get you anything?" asked Bill.

Draco shook his head and turned on his side, trying to fight back the urge to cry. He couldn't cry, so what was the point? He grabbed onto one of the pillows, squeezing it tight as he pushed back the desire to groan or scream or something.

Bill reached out and grabbed his hand, holding it reassuringly, and he didn't let go all night, not even when the shivers increased and he was sure he was clinging to Bill's hand so tightly he must be cutting of the circulation, maybe even bursting a few blood vessels. He would have to check Bill's hand for bruises when he was better.

In the early hours of morning the nausea and stomach cramps started. There was nothing to throw up this time, not even stomach acid, but that didn't stop Draco's body from trying and he spent nearly an hour dry heaving and retching, finally curling up on his side as his stomach burned. This time the trembling was because he felt cold, but he had also broken out into a sweat. His mind was consumed by one thought: he needed more.

He didn't know how much time had passed before he stirred, the craving growing too strong. He pushed himself up, looking over and seeing Bill watching him. That alone was enough to make him clench his jaw and lie back down, shame flushing his cheeks and forcing back the gnawing at the back of his mind. Twenty minutes later and he shifted again, the need outweighing embarrassment. He pushed himself up.

"Draco."

That was Bill.

Draco halted his movements. He really didn't want this; he didn't. He swung his legs over the bed.

"Draco, what are you doing?"

Draco clenched his teeth, pulling in harsh, hissing breaths. He ran an aggravated hand through his hair. He didn't want this, but at the same time, he needed it.

"Bill." He turned to the older man. "I…I really don't want more."

Bill's gaze was even, reassuring. "I know."

"Then why do I want it?"

"It's just the addiction talking."

"I know, I just-," he cut off, grabbing at his hair and tugging, trying to relieve some of the pressure on his head. This wasn't working. He couldn't breathe; he couldn't think. He just needed some, a little bit, just to take the edge off. Somewhere his brain was telling him that a little bit wouldn't help at all; it would just hook him further. He had only taken one dose and if he just rode this out he would be fine.

It wasn't fair. He hadn't been able to savor that last bit properly. If he took another dose, knowing that it was the last one, it would be easier, wouldn't it?

It wasn't until Bill's hands rested on his shoulders that he realized he had gotten off the bed and was taking a step towards the door.

"Where are you going?" asked Bill, but he must already know the answer because his expression was sympathetic, pained.

"I just, just a little bit, Bill. I swear, just a little. I can't think, all the thoughts are muddled in my head, and they can't get out. A tiny bit, that's it, I swear."

"Draco, you know that's not a good idea."

"I know, I know, but Bill, I need it."

"You don't need it."

"Yes, yes, I do. It hurts; my head is killing me, just a little."

"Draco, no."

He groaned in frustration. "Why are you doing this?"

"I'm not; it's the drug."

"And that's why I…oh Merlin, I'm begging now, aren't I?" The moment of clarity hurt. He blindly reached out, grabbing onto Bill's shoulder with his right hand. His left was sore. "Bill, merde, I-I really don't want it."

"I know."

"Shit." The craving returned with a vengeance, causing his vision to swim. Bill held onto him as he swayed.

"You okay, Draco?"

"I would be, if I just had a little more," said Draco, pushing away from Bill. "I need it."

"No you don't. You just said you didn't."

"You don't understand."

"Explain it then."

"How am I supposed to do that? I bet you never had an addiction, or never even tried smoking. I bet you don't even Apparate until an hour after you drink. I need some."

And he took a step forward, only to be blocked by Bill again. He tried brushing past him, but Bill was quicker than he was in his state.

"Damn it, Bill!" And then Draco was sending a fist towards Bill's face. Bill easily caught his wrist, and then grabbed onto his other hand as well, holding firmly, tightly, forcing him backwards. Draco tried twisting away, anger coloring his vision and he was full out struggling. He knew, if he had his wand, he would have been spitting out dark spells, not caring that he was fighting his first true friend. He just needed his drugs. At this moment, it didn't matter who he had to fight through to get to them, as long as he could have just one hit more, just one.

He vaguely heard that Bill was apologizing, but he couldn't think why. He knew in the next moment when he was kicked off his feet and he fell heavily onto the bed. On his back.

His vision exploded with bursts of pain and the breath left his lungs in a pained cry. He tried to arch away from the source of pain, but he was being held down, his back being pressed into the covers. The pain pushed away the voice of the drug and he found himself staring up at Bill who was looking just as pained as he was.

Draco choked back another cry, clenching his eyes shut, trying to focus on the fire burning up his back and not the one that screamed for the illegal potion. He sucked in a breath and slowly let it out, opening his eyes when he was calm again.

"I'm so sorry," said Bill.

"Not your fault," Draco managed.

"If I let you up are you going to try to take a swing at me again?"

Draco shook his head, and then Bill helped him turn onto his side very slowly. Draco lay there for a few moments while the fire died away, and then the cravings passed into stomach cramps. He curled up on his side. Bill pulled the covers down and gently draped them over him, careful not to let them fall over his back. Draco felt his eyes slowly slipping shut and he finally fell asleep.

Bill made sure that Draco was fully asleep before slipping out of the room to find something to eat. It was early morning, but there were a few people up, mainly his mother and father, Sirius, and Kingsley who liked to stop over for a pot of coffee and a chat before heading off to the Ministry. Dumbledore was there as well.

"How is he?" asked Dumbledore. He hadn't been at the Order for their arrival, but he must have heard the story.

"Sleeping," said Bill, sitting heavily in a chair and accepting the cup of coffee his mother poured for him.

"And he's –?"

Bill knew, from their looks, that they had probably already guessed. "Going through withdrawal," he said, before taking a sip of coffee.

"Don't blame him," muttered Sirius.

"He isn't buying from anyone I should know about, is he?" asked Kingsley.

Bill shook his head. "He made it."

The adults exchanged concerned looks.

"He's not…a regular user, is he?" asked Arthur.

"No," said Bill. "He's not."

"But he took illegal drugs."

"He's not an addict."

"But if he's making it himself…," said Molly, obviously wary of having a druggie in the house.

"It's the first time he's taken any deliberately," said Bill, and then realized what he had just let slip. He must be really tired.

"Deliberately?" asked Dumbledore, frowning in concern.

Bill sighed, knowing that it would be best to just tell them to dispel any thoughts they had, even though he doubted Draco would like that. Well, Draco didn't always know what was best for himself. If he ever wanted to live in this house peaceably, some things would have to be explained. He looked up at the Order.

"His mother wanted him out of the way because she was having a party one summer," said Bill. "She's a regular user, and so she slipped him some of her drugs and kept him sedated for over a week." He took another sip of his coffee. "Draco just got disowned and had his signum marked through and he didn't know how to deal."

"His mother drugged him?" asked Molly, looking horrified at that thought.

Bill nodded.

"With what?" asked Kingsley.

"Angel Flight," said Bill.

"And that's what he…?"

"Yeah."

"There was no report of the incident."

"There wouldn't be," said Dumbledore. "Not with such a powerful family. Healers can be found who will keep their mouth shut for cases of abuse with the right amount of money."

"There wasn't a Healer. Lucius brought Draco through withdrawal on his own."

The adults all looked surprised at that. Bill wondered if he had looked the same when Draco had revealed that about his father.

"Just out of curiosity, William," said Dumbledore, "would this be the summer before Draco's third year?"

Bill nodded.

"That does explain a lot about his behavior then," said Dumbledore, no doubt putting two and two together, that Draco's outbursts had begun as drug cravings.

"Yeah," Bill agreed.

"How much longer is he going to be…indisposed?" asked Molly.

"I think he's through the worst of it," said Bill. "I'm going to Floo home and say hello to Fleur, let her know where I am."

He drank the rest of his coffee and then stood. "I'll be back in a few."

Fleur was up when Bill arrived and she was just starting a quick breakfast. Bill wanted to take over for her, but she took one look at his haggard appearance and sat him at the table, refusing to let him do so much as set the table.

"I'm not the one that's having a baby," he tried to protest, but she shushed him with a kiss.

"Not for another three weeks," she said.

"Shouldn't you be on bed rest or something?"

She sniffed. "I am part Veela," she said, somewhat haughtily. "We don't do bed rest. Now, tell me exactly what is going on with Draco."

And so Bill related the story while he ate breakfast and Fleur refused to let him back in the house until Draco was fully recovered, effectively exiling him to the Headquarters. Sometimes Bill wondered how he deserved her.

He went straight back to Draco after that, relieved to see that the boy still hadn't woken up. He was lying on his stomach, pillows pushed up above his head, his face turned towards the door. Even when sleeping he looked pained and Bill silently cursed Narcissa in his head.

Draco started stirring around noon, waking Bill up, who had drifted off to sleep a bit himself.

"Hey," said Bill. "How you feeling?"

Draco groaned, hand reaching up to rub at his eyes as he blinked about the room. He tried pushing himself up, but a grimace crossed his face and he let his arms drop.

"Shit," he said.

"Hey, Draco, you alright?"

The grey eyes slid over to him and then cleared a little. "Bill."

"Surprised?" asked Bill, smiling lightly at the obvious statement.

"Dunno," said Draco, his words slurring which made Bill frown in concern. "Didn't think you'd still be here."

He shifted a bit, pulling down a pillow to rest his head on, but even that movement caused him to wince.

"What hurts?" asked Bill.

"I'm fine."

"Don't you dare start that again, or I swear I'll borrow a bit of Veritaserum from Snape."

Draco smirked, or rather attempted to, but his lips barely twitched. In fact, he looked exhausted. There were deep circles under his eyes, his face was incredibly pale, and his hair was hopelessly tussled.

"What hurts?" asked Bill.

"My head," said Draco. "And my back."

"Can I get you any pain reliever?"

"Not for another twelve hours," said Draco.

"What about some salve for your back?"

"That would work."

Bill nodded. "I'll be right back."

The first aid kit was in the bathroom, and Bill returned in just a few seconds. The only light in the room was from the small lamp on the dresser and so Bill flipped on the bedside lamp as well to have better light to see by. He didn't realize just how bad Draco's head hurt.

Draco swore at the light, lapsing back to French, and squeezing his eyes shut, but it was already too late. He leaned over the side of the bed, retching again even as Bill realized the problem and switched off the light. He helped Draco lie back down once the dry heaving had stopped.

"Sorry about that," he said, feeling rather guilty at his blunder.

"It's fine," said Draco, his voice somewhat raw.

"So, I'm thinking your head is a little more than hurting right now?" he asked.

"Yeah," Draco admitted.

"And your back is a little more than sore."

Draco gave a small nod. Bill decided the lecture could wait for another time.

"Let's get your shirt off, yeah?"

He helped Draco sit up so he could ease the shirt off the boy, wincing when he could see Draco clenching his jaw as the motion jarred both his head and back. By the time he was lying down again, he had broken out into a sweat.

Bill gently pulled off the gauze he had put on the other day, wincing when he saw the burns. While the salve had helped, the wounds were sill unpleasant to look at, harsh against the pale skin.

He opened the first aid kit and found the vial of burn salve he needed. He poured some onto a gauze pad and then gently dabbed at the burns. Draco flinched.

"Sorry," said Bill, already apply the salve as softly as he could.

"It's fine," said Draco.

Bill snorted and flicked the kid, very lightly, on the arm. He could see Draco's lips twitch ever-so-slightly upwards. He returned to spreading the ointment, only stopping when he was sure that every inch of burn was covered.

"Is this even ethical?" he asked, taping gauze strips over the marks again.

"It's one of the older traditions in wizarding law," said Draco.

"So because you get disowned some guy gets to take a hot poker to your back?"

Draco flinched again. "It wasn't some guy."

"What do you mean?"

Draco looked as if he was trying to push some unpleasant memory away from him. "It was Lucius," he finally said, voice no more than a whisper.

Bill stared at him and then swore, loudly. He was about to say something, but then Draco cut him off.

"Bill. I have a headache."

Bill stopped himself, knowing that Draco was only admitting to pain so that Bill wouldn't be able to say anything, because that would just make the situation that much more real. Bill remembered what Draco had said about not wanting to tell him because then he would have to feel something, and he just wanted to forget it.

"We're going to talk about this, later," he told Draco.

Draco didn't answer. Bill checked Draco's bandages once more before seeing something that made him pause. Draco's skin was pale and completely smooth without a blemish on it, if the signum and burns on his shoulders were overlooked, but there was another mark. This one was further down his back, and was nothing more than a fine, horizontal line of silvery scar tissue.

"What's this?" asked Bill, brushing the line with his finger. It was just barely raised from the rest of his skin.

He suddenly had a flash back of running from the Death Eaters, Draco fighting a man with a knife. He remembered sitting in the abandoned house with the wards pulled up and seeing blood on Draco's shirt.

"This is when you rescued me," he said.

"Yeah," said Draco.

"I didn't know it was that bad," said Bill.

"It wasn't," said Draco.

"You have a scar."

"I scar pretty easily."

"You should have gotten this looked at."

"Because that wouldn't have been suspicious."

He had a point. Bill packed the first aid kit back up and set it by the bed.

"Thank you," he said.

"You already said that."

"I'm saying it again."

Draco was silent for a moment, before meeting his eyes. "Thank you, for staying."

"Not a problem. Do you think you can sleep anymore?"

"Probably not," said Draco.

"When will you be better?"

"Tomorrow, maybe. Just the headache now."

Bill nodded. "The headache that you can't take any potion for but makes you throw up at any increase in light."

"Yeah."

"You should probably try to sleep."

"Yeah," said Draco again. Already his eyes were closing, and it was apparent he was exhausted, but he didn't seem to be sleeping because every so often he would open his eyes and shift positions, trying to find one comfortable enough. Bill doubted that with both the burns on his back and going through withdrawal, he would ever find a position where he wasn't uncomfortable.

After watching him for a few hours, he wondered if Draco just needed a distraction so he pulled out the book and started reading out loud. It appeared to help because although Draco didn't sleep, he was able to lie quietly.

There was a soft knock on the door some time after dinner and Bill opened it up to see Ginny at the door with a tray of food.

"Hi," she said quietly. "Mum wanted to know if you wanted something to eat."

Bill glanced back at Draco. "I don't know," he said.

"Sirius said something about smells making people going through withdrawal nauseas, so the food is charmed to be odorless. There's some soup too, if Draco feels like eating."

"Alright," said Bill. He was hungry. He took the tray but Ginny didn't move from the doorway.

"Can I see him?" she asked.

Bill looked back to see Draco laying on his stomach, but his face was turned towards Bill and his eyes were open, regarding him curiously.

"Alright," he said, "just for a little bit."

He let Ginny in and then shut the door, watching as Ginny knelt by the bed.

"Hey," she said softly.

Draco's brows furrowed. "What are you doing?"

"Visiting you," Ginny shrugged. "How are you feeling?"

"I thought you said that asking such questions got old."

"That was when the indisposed person was in the infirmary; you've just been holed up in here for a day and a half. But you do look like shit again."

"You should never become a Healer. Your bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired."

"It's a good thing I'm not going into Healing then; I'm going into-,"

"Law, I know."

"I never told you that."

"You visited Granger an awful lot."

"And you eavesdropped?"

"I was right there. It was rather hard not to hear, with how you were moaning on about how people still thought you liked Potter."

"I was not moaning."

"You were."

Ginny stuck out her tongue at him. Draco raised an eyebrow, but his lips twitched as well.

"So," said Ginny, "how are you feeling?"

"Asking now isn't going to make me recant. You would still make a terrible Healer."

"And you're misdirecting my question."

Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm fine."

"Funny, you don't look it."

"We've been over this and you've already given your opinion."

"Maybe I just want the truth."

"So saying 'I feel like crap' is going to make you stop asking questions?"

"If it's the truth."

"And if the truth really is 'I'm fine'?"

"It isn't. No one who actually feels alright looks like you do right now."

"Fine. I have a headache."

"A partial truth," said Ginny.

"But truth none-the-less."

Ginny looked unconvinced "Did you want some soup? I brought some up for you. It's chicken noodle with carrots and peas and-,"

She cut off because Draco paled and then leaned over the side of the bed, over the bucket, but this time he managed to suppress the heaving.

"So," said Ginny, "a headache and nausea."

Draco lay back on the bed, still a bit pale. He glared at Ginny who merely shrugged.

"Well, on that note, feel better soon Draco." She patted his hand and then got up. "Bye, Bill."

Bill waved and then she was out the door, closing it softly behind her. Bill turned to Draco with raised eyebrows.

"You two seem to get along," he said, wondering if the boy problem Ginny had was in anyway connected to Draco, but as soon as the thought came into his head he dismissed it. Ginny hadn't exactly been flirting, she had just nearly made him throw up, and while Draco had seemed to be less abrasive around her, that could just be because she was a girl and because Bill had been in the room.

Draco gave him a look, one that clearly said 'I thought I was the one high here. What have you been smoking?'

Draco then caught sight of the plate Bill was holding and he groaned, turning his face away and pulling a pillow over his head. Bill laughed, quietly though.

So, I'm sticking with Tuesday updates most likely. See you next week, and please leave a review on your way out.





2. Settling in and Secret Revealed

Disclaimer: Nope, don't own 'em.

Author's Note: I have been informed that fanfic doesn't like author's responding to anonymous reviews in their chapters, so I will no long replying here. However, I do appreciate all reviews, and I reply to all signed ones, so if you don't have an account you can get one, and I can thank you personally. But for now, thank you all. There was an overwhelming number of you reviewing my first chapter, and I thank you so much for your support.

Draco fell asleep late that night, but when he did it was deep and dreamless. That evening he had felt the craving slowly fade to a mere whisper in the back of his mind and the burn on his back had morphed into an itch. Draco found the itch was much easier to deal with.

He woke up around seven-thirty. Bill's chair was empty; he was no doubt getting some more coffee and Draco felt guilty having forced Bill to sit with him. He lay still for a few moments, collecting his thoughts, but the silence in the back of his mind seemed to taunt him now that the drug was fading. He needed to distract himself.

Draco pushed himself up, feeling a slight tug on his back where the scabs on his shoulders pulled at the more flexible flesh and there was pain, but nothing too bad. He sat all the way up and swung his legs over the bed, running a hand through his hair. He hadn't showered in days and it was noticeable.

He saw his wand lying on the nightstand and performed a few quick but thorough cleaning spells, and then freshened his clothes as well. He pulled on his shirt and buttoned it, feeling the brush of fabric sting against his back, but it was no longer excruciating. A quick glance in the mirror showed that while he looked acceptable, his complexion was pale and he had circles under his eyes. His hair was tussled and he tried to run his fingers through it, but it didn't help.

He couldn't find his shoes, and on second thought, he might have taken them off back in his flat. He glanced at the door, knowing that he would have to leave sometime and out there was distraction, something to take his mind off of the disconnect, but he wondered if it was too much. Leaving meant facing the Order, facing people that had been his enemy for so long, people who didn't know about him. He was annoyed at how daunting it seemed and he crossed to the door and pulled it open without allowing a second thought. He could hear voices echo up from the hall and he walked downstairs and into the dining room.

The dining room was large, holding a long oak table. On the far end several members of the Weasley family and Order were gathered having breakfast. They all stopped talking when he came into the room and several stared. Bill didn't.

"Draco, what are you doing up?" he asked, setting down his coffee mug and starting to stand.

Draco shrugged. "I feel better," he said. "I was going to head back over to my flat."

"Nonsense."

That was Dumbledore, coming into the room from what must be the kitchen with a teacup and saucer in his hands. He took a sip of the tea, smiled, and then twinkled at Draco.

"Why don't you sit down and have some breakfast? You must be hungry."

"I-," Draco started, but Dumbledore cut him off.

"Excellent. I have a few things I wish to discuss with you as well. There's a seat next to Bill that you can have."

Draco hesitated, but Bill was gesturing to the chair and everyone was still watching him so he made his way over to the empty chair and sat. He could still feel the gaze of the entire table on him and he steadfastly ignored them all until Dumbledore gave them a pointed look and they started their conversations again. Bill gave a smile of sympathy and then pushed the carafe his way.

"Coffee?" he asked.

"Thanks," said Draco, pouring himself a mug. Dumbledore took a seat across from him and then helped himself to the bowl of eggs that Charlie passed him.

"Eggs, Draco?"

"No, thank you."

"You should eat something," said Bill.

"Some toast might be easier to stomach, perhaps?" asked Dumbledore, passing the serving plate with the bread on it. "You've been through a lot these past few days."

Draco mentally braced himself for a lecture, but Dumbledore only gave him a small smile.

"I had hoped you would remember us," he said quietly.

Draco found he didn't know what to say, and Dumbledore's gaze was a little too kindly, so he looked down into his coffee. Mrs. Weasley came in just then carrying a platter of sweet rolls and she did a slight double take when she saw him.

"Oh, you're up," she said. "How are you feeling?"

Draco stared for a second. "Better," he said, and then remembering etiquette, "thank you."

"Good." Mrs. Weasley smiled. She sounded as if she was actually pleased to hear that he was feeling well, and then she set the platter down. "Fred, George, don't you dare take seconds until everyone has had one. Charlie, the kettle's on in the kitchen for tea. We've Earl Grey, lemon, and black. Ron, chew with your mouth shut please. How are you doing Harry? Have enough to eat?"

She said that all while working her way down the table to have a seat herself as the Weasley children and Sirius grabbed at the platter of sweet rolls and Charlie pushed his way through the mess to get to the kitchen.

"Get me a cup too, would you Charlie?" asked Bill. He took a sweet roll and then passed the plate to Draco, who passed it back down without taking one. People actually ate that for breakfast? He was used to sweet things such as pastries for breakfast, but not something so smothered in syrupy icing. Narcissa was obsessed with eating healthy, and would never allow for such a thing at the table.

"Same here," called out Sirius to Charlie.

"Earl Grey?" asked Charlie.

"Yeah," said Bill.

"That's perfect," said Sirius.

And that was when the controlled chaos broke out. Kingsley Shacklebolt arrived by the Floo and he was met without a loud hail from the table. Apparently, by the greetings, he was running quite late and everyone broke into separate conversations. Kingsley managed to steal a sweet roll from the plate as it was being passed down and then sat next to Mrs. Weasley, who started yet another conversation with him.

Charlie returned with the teas, but then Mr. Weasley arrived at the table, sitting next to his wife on the other side and Charlie left to grab another cup and coffee for Kingsley. Fred and George tried to get their father's attention, but he was too busy speaking with Harry and Hermione, and then Kingsley asked him a question as well. Fred and George decided it was better to be heard than it was to be understood so they merely yelled out their question, something about taking Ron somewhere. Mrs. Weasley answered a 'no' for her husband, but they continued asking anyway.

Draco noted that a few people were involved in simultaneous discussions, but it did not appear to be an efficient way of conversing because they were never paying attention to the right person to answer the questions asked them. At that moment he counted five different conversations occurring, well, five and a half because Charlie came in and, after delivering the beverages, was caught up in a conversation while it was occurring. They were mundane subjects, the plans for the day, the weather and when it might clear, and what everyone was going to do now that school was out, but for someone used to growing up at a table where not three words were spoken together, it was overpowering.

Draco was sure he was staring, and Bill caught the expression on his face and just laughed, and then told his mother he was going over to see Fleur, and was immediately engaged in a conversation about baby names. Draco had a fleeting thought that he wanted to go home, but that word 'home' conjured up a picture of the Malfoy mansion, but it wasn't home anymore; he had been disowned.

That knowledge shouldn't have hit him so hard, but the wound was still fresh and it was as if the scab had been torn off and he was bleeding afresh. He needed to get out. Now. And go anywhere silent and calm.

He was just about to get up when Ginny walked into the room. She didn't exactly walk though, but she wasn't quite skipping. There was just such an energy to her step it was like she bounded into the room, smiling as if the sun had told her directly it would be shining all day.

And everyone paused their conversations, turning to say hello. It was easy to see that she was the baby of the family and that the position had rubbed off on the rest of those present. Even Kingsley and Dumbledore smiled and returned her greeting, and she managed to steal the sweet roll right from Fred's plate, but it was his second, so he didn't complain too hard.

"Hey," she said to Draco, and she plunked right down on the chair next to him, taking a bite of the sticky bun.

"Hey," said Draco back, not exactly knowing why she was sitting next to him.

"Did you try a sweet roll?" she asked.

"No," said Draco.

"Want a bite?" she asked, holding out the bun.

"No," said Draco. Was it even normal to share food at the breakfast table?

Apparently it was because Fred was stealing half of George's second sweet roll, because Ginny had taken his, and Hermione was sipping Harry's coffee while Ron snagged the last bit of toast from her plate.

Ginny shrugged and took another bite. Draco was a little relieved to see that the initial chaos of the table had seemed to die down a bit and that people were talking normally amongst themselves without shouting over every other conversation. He even managed to eat a piece of toast in the relative quiet, although 'relative' was the operative word.

Ginny finished her breakfast, licked a bit of syrup off her finger, and then picked up his coffee mug and took a sip. Draco stared at her as she made a face, and then reached over for the coffee tray. She poured a good amount of cream into the cup and then stirred in a tiny bit of sugar. She took another sip and smiled.

"That's how you're supposed to drink it," she said.

"That was my coffee," said Draco.

"I know."

"You ruined it."

She handed him back the cup. "I made it better."

He looked down at the liquid that was now the shade of toffee. "You made a latte."

"I made it so you can drink it without corroding your stomach."

"The human stomach has an acidity of two to three on the ph scale. I doubt plain coffee is in anyway detrimental."

She wrinkled her nose. "I don't want to know about stomach acid. I just ate."

"You brought the conversation up," Draco objected.

"I brought up the stomach; you took it to a whole new level. How do you even know that stuff anyway?"

Draco frowned at the girl. Would he never understand women, or was it just her? He didn't remember Pansy being completely baffling, but then again Pansy was a Slytherin. Sometimes the most devious of people were the easiest to understand.

"That's a far too serious look to have in the morning," said Ginny.

"I blame you," said Draco.

"What did I do?"

"Ruined my coffee," said Draco, and to that she didn't have a response. He smirked.

Breakfast ended when Kingsley and Arthur checked the time and then left for work. The twins debated for a few moments about the pros and cons of going to their shop before deciding to leave as well.

"What about you, Charlie?" asked Sirius. "Off to those dragons of yours?"

"I'm off for the holiday," said Charlie.

"Good," said Mrs. Weasley. "You can help the rest with the dishes then."

Charlie rolled his eyes good naturedly but then started clearing the dishes. Dumbledore stood, motioning his head for Bill and Draco to follow him.

The Headmaster walked into the adjoining living room. It was a comfortable room, done in shades of beige and burgundy and Draco speculated it was a tribute to the large Gryffindor population in the Order. Bill took a seat on the couch and Draco sat in one of the armchairs wondering if Dumbledore was going to lecture him now or if he wished to discuss another matter.

The Headmaster closed the door and then sat in the armchair across from Draco.

"I am pleased to see that you are doing better," he said in opening.

"Thank you," said Draco, wishing he would just get on with it. Dumbledore seemed to notice because he gave a small smile and acquiesced.

"I want you to stay here until school starts again," he said.

Draco stared at him. "What?"

"I want you to stay here, with the Order," said Dumbledore.

"No. No way," said Draco, shaking his head.

"Why not?" That was from Bill and Draco turned to him.

"Why not?" he reiterated. "I'm joining, yes, not…not moving in."

"Why not?" asked Dumbledore.

"I have my own place. A nice place," said Draco.

"I think it might be best if you stayed here," said the Headmaster. "For your own safety."

"My safety?"

"You've given Voldemort a reason to come after you specifically, and I fear that he will do so, just as he did with Laney."

"I can protect myself, quite well in fact."

"I understand, but your flat is in Muggle London, and while that means it will not be easily found, you have less magical support."

"I don't need support. Besides, my flat is warded."

"Hogwarts was warded," said Dumbledore.

Draco couldn't argue with that, but that didn't mean he was staying.

"I can still look after myself," he said. "I've escaped the Dark Lord twice now."

"But not yourself," said Dumbledore.

Draco turned to him. "What is that supposed to mean?" he asked, already knowing what Dumbledore was trying to say but not giving him an inch.

"Only that, in keeping recent events to yourself and not coming to us when you could have, you harmed yourself and quite seriously."

Draco bristled. "So you don't trust me now, is that it? You're afraid that I'm going to get more drugs? Or perhaps even overdose?"

"It is a concern," said Dumbledore, "yes."

"I can assure you, I'm not," said Draco.

"I do not wish for you to take that chance."

"Worried that I might damage this brain of mine?" asked Draco. "That would be terrible, wouldn't it? Losing such an advantage over the Dark Lord."

Perhaps it was unfair of him to jump to such a conclusion, but he had just gotten up that morning, and he was still recovering. He had just attended a chaotic breakfast, one in which he had felt like a complete outsider and now they wanted him to stay? Draco couldn't do that; he needed to have his quiet, to have his places to think. He was overwhelmed.

"Draco, we don't mean it like that," Bill interrupted, sounding hurt at the accusation and Draco felt guilty yet again. Bill had just sat with him for two days, and he looked absolutely exhausted. Draco knew that Bill would never use him like that.

"I do," said Dumbledore, startling both of them. The Headmaster smiled. "But only partly. Mostly, Draco, we are worried for you. It isn't good to be so alone, especially when the holidays are coming up. It would only be a month, perhaps a little longer until the school is properly repaired. You would, by no means, be confined to the house, but this is the Order's Headquarters, and most of us plan to spend a large amount of time here. I think it would be beneficial to us all if you were here to give your input."

"You have meetings I can come to," Draco objected.

"Yes, but we also have long periods of planning and revising. We hope to send out more spies as well, and this will be our base. Information will be coming in at any moment of the day. We could use your help, and it would be more efficient to have you here."

Draco still hesitated. Being at the Order base was where he could do the most, and the prospect wasn't distasteful, but he just didn't deal with people well. He needed his alone time and space to think and work on other projects.

"There is a room," said Dumbledore, proving that he must have some Seer blood in him, "just down the hall from here. It's not large, just the size of a bedroom, but it's been cleared out and we have no use for it. I know that, for one who has grown up in a quiet atmosphere, this house can be overwhelming, and I've already put in a few muffling wards around the room as well as some chalkboards and a table. There's a bookshelf too. If you were interested in staying, you could have that room for your projects."

"I don't know," said Draco.

"Severus is setting up a potions lab in the basement to get started on stockpiling potions, and perhaps even experimenting on a few. I understand the two of you were working on a counter to Veritaserum."

Dumbledore had thought of every reason he should stay, but Draco found the idea of staying in the house stifling, confining, and yet at the same time, the nightmare of the Veil was pulled to mind.

He frowned, his fingers tapping quickly through their pattern. His own flat sounded peaceful, but also a little daunting. He wondered if he still had his potion vials and alcohol on the table. Right now he was still feeling a little disoriented from his disinheritment, and the idea of perfect silence was intimidating, but yet the idea of constant noise and constant company was almost frightening.

"Give it some time," said Bill from the couch. "You don't have to decide now, but you are going to be staying here for today at least. I'm going home to catch some sleep and I want to know that you're not alone. If it gets too much, you can spend a night or two at your place. If you really hate it here, you can just come over for the meetings. But for now, why don't you give it a try?"

"That sounds reasonable," said Dumbledore. He turned to Draco, raising his eyebrows.

Draco sighed. "Alright," he said, not knowing if he was agreeing because he felt he owed Bill or if he genuinely thought the idea sounded plausible.

"Excellent," said Dumbledore. "I can send someone now for your things if you'll let down the wards on your flat and you can settle in. I'm sure the Weasley's will be delighted to have another permanent resident."

Shit. What the hell had he gotten himself into now?

"I can get my own things," said Draco quickly, seeing that Dumbledore was about to leave.

"Do you really think you should?" asked Bill. "You just got up."

"William is right," said Dumbledore. "It would be best to let someone do all the 'heavy lifting' for you."

"No," said Draco. "Absolutely not. I am not going to have a whole bunch of Gryffindors in my flat packing up my personal effects. It is not going to happen."

Bill nodded, but he didn't look too happy at the thought of Draco packing by himself. "If you need help, let us know."

Draco rolled his eyes. "There is something called a shrinking charm; perhaps you've heard of it."

Bill laughed. "Good to know you're feeling better."

Draco flooed back to his flat after Bill went home to sleep. Despite his assurance to Bill that he would be fine, standing in his living room stirred up another craving and he closed his eyes counting to ten in French, English, and Latin before opening them again. He fought the craving back and walked straight into his kitchen, relieved to find that Bill had completely drained and rinsed out every potion vial and bottle of alcohol in his cupboard. He put on a pot of coffee and then went straight into his bathroom to take a hot shower.

By the time he got out of the shower and dressed in fresh clothes the coffee was finished. Instead of packing, he sat down and read the newspapers that had been delivered in his absence, deliberately taking his mind off of his status as the newest member of the Order and resident of Number 12 Grimmauld Place. It was easier than he thought it would be.

Once finished he went back to his bedroom. Most of his clothing was still packed in his trunk, but he exchanged the school robes for casual ones and then added a few pairs of comfortable trousers and button-up shirts as well. From what he had seen this morning, the headquarters was first and foremost a house, and so he wouldn't need to wear formal clothes, or even worry about a few wrinkles, not like he had when…well, before certain events had transpired.

The idea of casual dress wasn't quite as odd as it had been when he had first left home. Then, when he had stayed with Mark at the repair shop, the idea of wearing only jeans and a t-shirt, socks optional, had been almost daunting, and he had worn oxfords buttoned all the way up with neatly pressed trousers and polished shoes until Mark had thrown a bag full of jeans and ripped tee's at him and promptly stolen the rest of his clothes. That was when Draco had found the ugly, olive green jacket with the patches and pockets.

Now Draco was glad he was able to dress down comfortably. It was bad enough that his hair color was so noticeable and he didn't want any extra attention. Wearing dress robes, not to mention the most expensive and newly designed ones, would just make him stand out even further.

After he finished packing his clothing he walked into his study. This was the one room that was messy. Papers lay in half-crumbled piles over his desk, and towers of books lined the floor by the bookshelf. Several of them had tumbled because he had yanked their middles out and not bothered to repair them. His walls were still covered in parchment, though now the paper was starting to pull away from the wall.

Draco figured he would have to prioritize his projects. He doubted he could bring all of them to the Order, nor would he even have time for all of them. After all, he would be there until the school was fixed over winter break. That would only be a month, right?

He would finish the Persian Runes, and bring all of his work on the Veritaserum. And then there was the knife in his trunk, the one that had been speared through his arm. He would want to dissect the hexes on the dagger; any weapon that was virtually undetectable was something to be explored. That was three projects. Draco didn't know if that would be enough. If the Order members were too annoying he might be spending a lot of quality time with his work, but he decided that if it was too bad he could just leave.

He packed his work related items in his school bag, shrinking them so that they would fit. He looked regretfully at his keyboard, but he doubted he would have time for anything that…frivolous. He shrank his trunk and pocketed it, casting one look around the empty apartment before he left. For some reason, he didn't feel at all like he was leaving his home. He didn't exactly have one any more. He threw Floo on the fireplace and stepped through.

Bill slept most of the day in his own bed. When he woke up it was afternoon and his wife was making a cake to bring over to the Order for dinner.

"Does it ever strike you as odd," asked Bill, "that while we are discussing ways to defeat the most powerful dark wizard of our day, and strategizing attacks and defenses, we're doing it while eating dessert? I mean, I like it and all, and it does make this whole thing less intimidating, but it just seems strange."

"I think that's the main reason," said Fleur. "To stop it all from getting too serious, not that it isn't, of course. Now stop pondering and help me frost. I have to do my hair still before we head over."

Bill smiled and complied.

When they did head over to the Order before dinner, Molly was immediately leading Fleur over to a chair where there was a cup of hot chocolate already waiting. She was so excited at the prospect of having her first grandchild that she was constantly seeing to Fleur. Bill could tell that while his wife was perfectly healthy, she enjoyed the attention.

"How's Draco doing?" he asked his mother.

"He came back with his things this afternoon, and Dumbledore helped him set up the back room as a study or something, thought for what I have no clue, and he hasn't come out since."

Bill frowned. "I suppose I should go check on him," he said.

"And then bring him in," his mother called after him. "We're eating in fifteen minutes."

The back room was off a little ways from the kitchen and living room, and the door was shut. Bill knocked before entering, but even then, Draco didn't look over. The walls were covered in parchment which was in turn covered by runes. Draco was staring at a particular section, a marker in his hand. He seemed to figure out whatever it was he had been thinking on because he stepped forward and began writing swiftly, forming the complicated runes as easily as if they had been his original language.

"Have you been making any progress?" asked Bill.

Draco shrugged. "More or less," he said, finally looking over once he was finished writing. "You look better."

"How have you been?" asked Bill.

"Good," said Draco, in the same tones that he used to say 'Fine'. Bill wondered about the switch of words. Did he realize that Bill would only press him further if he said 'fine', or was he genuinely feeling better? Or was Bill just reading far too much into it?

"You're staring," said Draco, turning back to the wall. "I'm fine."

"My mum says you haven't come out of here all day."

"She's obviously mistaken then," said Draco. "I only set this up in the early afternoon. That's hardly all day."

"Don't be a prat," said Bill lightly. "Why are you hiding?"

"You make it sound like I'm scared of your family."

"Are you?"

Draco glanced over at him, but didn't answer.

"They don't bite," said Bill.

Draco rolled his eyes.

"So you are scared," said Bill.

"I'm not scared," said Draco, writing again on the wall. "I don't do crowds well. Besides, I've been doing nothing these past weeks. I'm making up for lost time."

"Draco, these past weeks you've been captured by Voldemort, beaten by Death Eaters, re-diagnosed Ron while you were recovering in the hospital, disowned and then sent through withdrawal."

"Precisely my point," said Draco.

"That doesn't mean you've been doing nothing. Doing nothing makes it sounds like you've been on holiday for the past two weeks."

Draco smirked at that. "World's worst holiday ever," he muttered.

"Don't you think you should give it a break?" asked Bill.

"You're family would drive me insane," said Draco.

"Alright, not a break then, just…take it easy, alright?"

"You don't call staying in the same room all afternoon and barely moving taking it easy?"

"Not when you're doing this," said Bill. "People get paid to do this sort of thing all day. It's an actual job, and working isn't taking it easy."

Draco shrugged. "Maybe it is for me."

"I would hate to see you on a real holiday," said Bill. "Forced to do nothing but lie in bed half the day, and then spend the other half walking on a beach or swimming in the ocean."

"I have been on holidays before, Bill," said Draco.

"Real holidays?" asked Bill.

"Yes, 'real' ones," said Draco, his tone somewhat exasperated, but his lips were upturned slightly, so he couldn't be too annoyed at Bill.

"Good," said Bill. Perhaps his tone was a little too approving because Draco glanced over at him again and rolled his eyes.

"I saw that," said Bill. "And it's dinnertime."

Draco grimaced.

"We're really not that bad," said Bill.

"Speak for yourself," said Draco, but he glanced over at the runes one more time and then set his marker down.

"How long until you have them finished?" asked Bill.

"A week or so," said Draco. "Less if you help me."

Bill raised his eyebrows at that as they walked out of the back room. "Are you asking for help?"

"It was your project in the first place," said Draco. "I've sort of taken it away from you."

Bill gave Draco a smile. "I would like to work on it with you," he said. "And as long as it gets translated, I don't care who does it. Well, scratch that. I wouldn't want Wentworth or someone translating it. They would just crow about for the rest of their lives."

They entered the dining room to find that most of the Weasley family and other residents of Number 12 had gathered already. There was only one seat free next to Fleur, and Bill was wondering if maybe he should sit at the end where there were a few extra seats in a row so that he could sit next to Draco for some friendly support, but to his surprise Draco deliberately walked over to the empty seat in between Harry and Ginny and sat.

That was obviously Draco's way of saying that he didn't need Bill watching out for him all the time, and Bill grinned then sat next to his wife, greeting her with a kiss.

The rest of the family filed in, and there were a few stray looks at the white-blond, but for the most part, the Weasley family appeared to be doing their best in acting as if there was nothing strange about eating dinner with a Malfoy, be he disowned or not. Even Fred and George were subdued and Bill wondered if Molly had warned them off of pranking Draco.

Bill almost wished, as dinner started, that Molly hadn't because while dinner was much less chaotic than breakfast, the conversation was stilted and distinctly uncomfortable. Awkward silences permeated what halting talk there was, and then no one wanted to be the first to break that silence. The third time the conversation stopped, Ginny leaned closer to Draco and whispered something in his ear.

Draco raised a pale eyebrow, and that was all the response, but when silence fell again, Ginny repeated the motion, again whispering. A corner of Draco's mouth rose, and Harry, sitting nearby him, smiled. The third time Draco regained control of his facial features and he suppressed his smile, but Harry snorted, and then flushed when the entire table looked at him. The fourth time Draco whispered something. Ginny smothered a laugh but Harry, who had just taken a sip of pumpkin juice, chocked and sprayed the table. That set Ginny into a fit of giggles and she buried her face in her hands to avoid the looks from the other occupants at the table.

"What exactly is going on here?" asked Mrs. Weasley, her tone reproving, but she was smiling as well.

"Nothing," said Ginny, from behind her hands.

Harry fought back another bout of laughter and mostly succeeded. "Sorry," he managed.

Bill caught Draco's gaze and raised his eyebrows. Draco just smirked and serenely sipped at his pumpkin juice. Bill frowned when Draco didn't answer, but his look had no affected.

"What was so funny?" asked Ron, looking at Harry.

"It wasn't as funny as it was…unexpected," said Harry.

"What was unexpected?"

"That Draco here actually has a sense of humor," said Ginny.

Now everyone was looking at Draco, whose face was blank, but Bill could see the edges of his cold mask pulled up. He obviously wasn't used to the attention.

"Well?" asked Ron.

"We were debating which would be the best way to end the awkward silences," said Ginny. "Draco's won."

The table looked at Draco expectantly. Draco raised an eyebrow and shrugged languidly.

"I was merely suggesting that the Dark Lord's love life might be a startling and new topic of discussion and one which would be interactive but I didn't believe it was actually suitable for the dinner table."

There was a silence again, but one of shock and not discomfort. Sirius ended it by breaking into large guffaws, doubling over in his seat as he laughed. Fred and George joined him and Arthur looked as if he wanted to as well, but he was restraining his mirth because Molly wasn't quite amused. Bill laughed himself, and beside him Fleur was shaking her head as she smiled.

Bill looked over to see that Draco was watching all of them with a guarded expression, but he didn't appear to be as tense as he was when he first walked in the room. There was something else though. Draco should be smirking, or at least, his eyes should be, but he wasn't.

"Wait," said Bill. "You're serious, aren't you?"

The laughter stopped and everyone looked back at the white-blond. Draco looked at Bill.

"I thought it might be more suitable for the Order meeting, but that doesn't mean it loses any of its shock value."

"Voldemort?" asked Harry. "Has a love life?"

"Something I do not want to know," said Fred.

"Nor did I ever want to know," said George.

"Shouldn't there be a law against it?" asked Fred.

"A law of nature?" asked George.

"Plain common sense?"

"An unspoken rule that is glaringly obvious?"

"Like gravity?"

"Perfect example."

"Why, thank you George."

"No problem, Fred."

The twins grinned at each other, and then grinned at the rest of the table. There was one moment, when it looked as if there was going to be another awkward silence, but then Hermione leaned closer to the table, so she could see Ginny, and asked her if she knew of any good clothing stores in Diagon Alley. Arthur began conversing with Sirius and Mrs. Weasley with Fleur. Harry and Ron were debating Quidditch statistics until they realized that there was a genius sitting by them and turned to Draco for verification.

Bill smiled and came to his wife's rescue as Fred and George began pressing to know what they had decided to name their child. They seemed to think 'Gred' was an appropriate name for a little boy, 'Greda' for a girl.

Dinner was finished soon afterwards, and then the table was cleared for the Order meeting. Kingsley was first to arrive, and as he was a bachelor who still hadn't mastered the art of cooking, he helped himself to the leftovers in the kitchen. Tonks and her family arrived next. They immediately sought out Draco to get acquainted with the family member they hadn't been allowed to meet, due to Andromeda's marriage.

Bill watched Draco, noting that he actually seemed to be interested in meeting the family members he had only heard mentioned in whispers. Bill was infinitely glad that Kingsley and Tonks had arrived first because the next member who stepped out was none other than Alastor Moody, and he did not looked pleased. Luckily Minerva was next to show up, with Severus right behind her, and McGonagall was quite adept at keeping Alastor away from Severus, and Bill knew she would do the same with Draco. Now, if they could only keep Severus and Sirius away from each other, things might actually go smoothly.

And for the most part, they did. Of course, Bill now realized exactly why his mother and Dumbledore liked to serve dessert at the Order meetings. Dumbledore welcomed them all, as usual, but then he extended an additional welcome to Draco their newest member. Moody looked like he wanted to say something very cutting indeed, but Dumbledore had timed the introduction right when Alastor had taken a bite of his cake, and so he couldn't say anything at all. Dumbledore continued on.

"As you know Draco has already been a great asset to the Order, having discovered how to pull objects back from the veil in the Department of Mysteries, something we are all very grateful for."

Harry grinned and Sirius nodded in Draco's direction. Draco returned it, but Bill could see that his eyes were still slightly frosted.

"And, as soon as Draco feels up to it, we will go back and pull out Voldemort's Horcrux as well," said Dumbledore. "How's next week sounding Draco?"

Draco shrugged. "Anytime's fine with me."

"I'm sorry," said Andromeda, speaking up. "I must have missed that meeting. How did Draco figure out how to pull objects from the Veil?"

Half the table suddenly frowned, as if suddenly realizing that they had never asked that before. They all looked over at Dumbledore who turned to Draco. "Would you care to explain, Draco?"

Bill watched him shrug, trying to affect an unconcerned expression on his face. "Bill and I translated the Persian Runes," he said.

"You translated them," Bill spoke up. "I just got you started."

"Aren't those untransalteable, though?" asked Mrs. Weasley. She knew that Bill had been working on those runes for awhile now.

"Not anymore," said Draco.

"So how did you translate them?"

Draco glanced up at Bill who raised his eyebrows, urging the boy to spill. Draco frowned, and then glanced at Dumbledore, who was nodding in the 'go ahead' gesture.

Draco sighed. "I'm a genius."

"A what?" asked Fred and George in unison.

"A genius," said Draco. "It means I'm really smart."

Alastor snorted. "You expect us to believe that? You learned it from the Death Eaters, didn't you?"

"Alastor," said Dumbledore, the warning in his voice.

"That's how you saved Ron," said Mrs. Weasley.

"It was just a misdiagnosis," said Draco.

"But you knew what it was."

"And it does explain your certain advancement in Transfigurations," said McGonagall.

"Is that why you didn't join Voldemort?" asked Andromeda.

Bill hid a wince, wondering how Draco was going to react to that personal question.

The white-blond shrugged. "Partly," he said, not exactly answering the question.

"What was the other part?" asked Sirius.

Draco glanced over at Bill. "I guess I just had a good Ancient Runes professor."

Bill felt his mouth stretch into a smile, and he was pretty sure he grinning like a fool.

"Enough of this," said Fred.

"Yeah, we want to hear about more interesting things," said George.

"Like Voldemort's love life."

"What can we say? We are sickly curious."

"What's this?" asked Kingsley.

Half the table looked over at Draco, and Bill could see him flush slightly.

"Claire Jameson," he said, "our student teacher last year, well, she has…a thing for the Dark Lord. When I was teaching her how to translate the runes, I may have, well, set them up."

The entire Order stared at him; Bill glanced at Ginny. She was watching Draco as well, but her expression was unreadable, but that bit of dark in her eyes was pronounced. Bill wondered if she was thinking of the diary, when she had poured out her heart to Tom Riddle.

"You played matchmaker for Voldemort?" Hermione finally asked.

"I was trying to see if the Dark Lord would go the way of Marius Apollo," said Draco.

No one got the reference, except Dumbledore of course.

"You were thinking that Claire might temper Voldemort a little bit?"

"It was a thought," said Draco. "I was also hoping that, if the Aurors didn't show up, I might be able to gain a little of leeway with her."

"Do you think it worked?"

"Well, if anything, he'll at least have a distraction at night."

Fred and George laughed, Sirius chuckled a bit as well. Harry groaned.

"So, the next time I get a vision it might be…?" He trailed off but the Order got what he was trying to say. They just laughed.

Yay! Second chapter is up. The third will be holding a lot more action, but for now, Draco is settling in as best he can. Please leave a review!





3. A Storm and a Baby

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. I do own the seventh book, which I stood in line for three hours for (and two of those were after the book started selling—sigh). Anyway, loved the seventh, and now I'm sad it's over, but hey, we still have fanfic. Woot!

Author's note: This is a really long chapter…well, longer than usual because after I read the seventh book (in like five hours), I needed to do something to stop the tears at the end of HP series.

There was a storm that night, but after the initial bout of thunder and lightning, the steady pattern of the rain made it easier to sleep. Still, he was up and dressed before most of the house was stirring. He went downstairs, prepared to work until breakfast, but Sirius Black was already in the dining room drinking a cup of tea and reading the paper.

Draco stopped outside the dining room, not knowing if he wanted to enter and disturb the man, but he had to go through the room to get to his study.

"I don't bite, at least, not when I'm human," said Sirius, looking up from the paper and giving Draco a half-grin. "The kettle's still hot, or you can start a pot of coffee. Kingsley will be around in a bit, so if you do, make enough for him."

Draco hesitated, but then nodded and crossed into the kitchen to start the coffee. When he came back out, Sirius had laid down the newspaper pages he was done with by the empty seat in front of him, not to close to make him uncomfortable, but not far away to stilt a conversation. Draco had forgotten that Sirius had come from a long line of Slytherins, but it was relatively easy to do so. Sirius had been young when thrown into Azkaban, and then he had spent over a year beyond the Veil. His emotional growth was stunted, and paired with Gryffindor attitude, he came across as brash, cocky, and twenty-five.

Draco sat across from Sirius and picked up the paper.

"Early riser then?" asked Sirius, turning a page.

"Yeah," said Draco.

"Well, that's two of us at least. You're on page five, but the way. Have been in the papers since the news broke out about the split in your family."

"Oh," said Draco.

There was silence for a few moments while Draco avoided looking at page five.

"It gets easier," said Sirius, suddenly.

Draco looked up, meeting Sirius' gaze. Sirius gave a sort of wry smile.

"Never thought I'd be saying that to a Malfoy, but then again, you did save my life."

"Not really," said Draco, looking back down and finding an interesting article. "You were caught in a gateway between the physical world and whatever else is out there. You were unable to exist in that temporal plane because it was unsuited for the chemical and electrical impulses we call life. Because of that, you were essentially paused as you were caught in limbo. I just returned your body to its original plane of existence."

There was a silence and Draco looked up to see that Sirius was staring at him. His mother's cousin finally laughed and shook his head.

"Thank you for returning me then. I appreciate it."

Draco nodded and then the fireplace flamed green. Kingsley Shacklebolt stepped out, wearing the red uniform robes of the Aurors.

"Kingsley," said Sirius. "Actually on time today, huh?"

Kingsley grunted and then went straight for the kitchen.

"He won't be able to put two words together before his first cup," said Sirius.

Kingsley returned a few moments later without a large mug of coffee. He sat at the table as well, staring at nothing and drinking his coffee. Draco returned to the article he was reading, his fingers drumming lightly on the table. There was silence again, but it was the comfortable time.

"There was coffee," said Kingsley suddenly.

Draco looked over to see that the Auror had drunk half his mug.

"Who made it?" asked Kingsley.

"Malfoy did," said Sirius, still reading his paper.

"Thanks," said Kingsley.

Draco nodded and then got up to get some himself. It took him a few moments to find the mugs.

"Oi, Malfoy," Sirius shouted from the dining room.

Draco frowned but stepped back so he could see into the other room. Ginny had joined the table, but it was obvious she had just gotten up because she was still in her pajamas and she was somewhat slumped over the table.

"Get a cup of coffee for Ginny, while you're at it?" asked Sirius.

"Yeah," said Draco.

He poured another mug and then added a good amount of cream and a little bit of sugar to the second. He brought them out.

Ginny had taken the seat next to his, and he couldn't very well choose a different seat farther away, and so he slid in next to her and placed the coffees on the table. She looked up blearily.

She obviously hadn't slept well because there were dark circles under her eyes and her face was pale, but it was still apparent that she was a pretty girl, even without any make-up. To be sure, there were a few too many freckles on her face, and her lips weren't quite as full as the current fashion, but her features were still even and pleasing. Her eyes were hazel, an actual hazel, with flecks of green and yellow in the jasper irises, and she had full eyelashes. Her hair was also pretty, but a different shade than the rest of the Weasley children. Instead of being a decided red, her hair was lighter with a golden undertone. Right now it was pulled back in a tangled, sloppy sort of bun, but a few strands escaped and she batted them away, reaching for her coffee.

"Late night, Ginny?" asked Sirius.

"Couldn't sleep," she said, taking a sip of her coffee. She turned to Draco with a surprised smile. "You remembered how I like it."

He shrugged.

"Was it the storm?" asked Sirius. "It was right over the house and the thunder woke me up quite a few times."

Ginny gave a shrug. "Just can't sleep during storms."

Draco could tell she was holding something back, but he wasn't sure what. She couldn't be afraid of the storms, could she? His mind flashed back to the other times he had seen her. The ghoul in the hall in his sixth year, she hadn't been afraid then, not even after she had nearly died. She treated it like a daring stunt on a broom: a few seconds of adrenaline and then a bit of giddy laughter. She had also used the Bat-Boogey Hex on him fifth year. He had underestimated her then, thinking her to still be the shy Weaselette, and the curse had caught him off guard, but just the curse. He had known the attack by Dumbledore's Army was coming and his questions about Pureblood superiority had caused him to let the students 'escape'. No, Ginny didn't seem to be one that would be afraid of thunderstorms, but what other explanation was there?

It was disconcerting how easily the youngest Weasley could occupy his thoughts he realized as he had spent a good few minutes thinking about her. It had happened at the dance as well. Immediately the picture of Ginevra Weasley in that black dress appeared in his mind and he mentally groaned, trying to shove the thought away. What was wrong with him?

He took a few gulps of his coffee, and picked up the paper again. He was just a little off balance, that was all. Moving into a houseful of Gryffindors could do that to anyone.

Mrs. Weasley came down ten minutes later, fussing over Ginny and then Kingsley and Sirius, who both bore her attention with good grace and amusement, before turning to Draco.

"And how are you feeling?" she asked. "You looked a little peaky yesterday. Are you doing better?"

Draco was taken aback. "Um, yeah," he said.

"Would you like anything for breakfast? I was going to start making some eggs and toast and some pancakes, but I can whip up some muffins if you would rather."

Draco blinked. The fact that the Weasley matriarch actually made the meals wasn't surprising, but the fact that she was so concerned over what he wanted as a little startling. Maybe she was trying to be nice because he had saved Ron.

"Whatever you're making is fine," he said. He wouldn't want anything special anyway. The one time Narcissa had cooked something was to make him a 'special' lunch and he had spent the next week high on Angel-Flight. It wasn't that he thought Mrs. Weasley would poison him, but he was a little wary of mothers in general.

He left to his study after breakfast. Most of the Weasley family had made it down for the meal, though Ron and Harry were still sleeping, according to Hermione. It was a much more relaxed meal even though the only ones that actually talked to Draco were Kingsley, Hermione, and Ginny. The rest were still a little wary of him. Not wary of his allegiance, but it wasn't everyday a teenaged genius was present for breakfast. Bill was coming by later that day to join Draco on the runes, and so Draco turned to another project until Bill came, the knife.

For the first time, Draco got a good look at the dagger that had been plunged through his arm. It was old, but well preserved. It was obvious that the sheath was not the original covering for the weapon because the sheath was gold and silver. The silver was twisted into vine like strands with small thorns. The gold was melted into tiny flowers, every petal clearly visible. It was the work of a master, but it was designed for a woman's dagger. Draco suspected it was crafted in the early fourteen hundreds.

The knife was different. The blade was kept sharp and stainless by a number of spells and there was a thin groove down both sides of the blade, which was interesting. Usually only long swords had such fullers, to cut down the weight of the sword without decreasing its strength. This line was not straight, however, but slightly curved and in the shape of a snake.

The hilt was dragon leather, so dark green it was almost black. Twisted several times around the leather was a thin silver snake, the head of which made up the decorative pommel. Its mouth was open, diamond fangs extended, and its eyes were glittering emeralds.

Draco couldn't even begin to guess the long knife's age, but it was old, very old. He placed the knife on the table in front of him and then pulled out an empty notebook, a quill, and some ink.

That was where Bill found him two hours later. By that time he had looked through almost all of the books on old weapons he had brought with him, and some were lying open on the table, while some he had tossed on the floor. He had run a few experiments on the knife, mostly judging the sharpness of the blade, and how well it resisted stain. He had isolated a few of the charms that had been placed on the knife, but even so, the strength of the magic was baffling.

"What's this?" Bill asked, coming into the room.

Draco glanced up, before returning back to the notebook he was writing in.

"Another project," he said. "Just give me a second."

He finished writing the sentence he was on, but Bill had already crossed over to the table and picked up the knife.

"Rather Slytherin," he said, and then he turned to Draco. "Is this-?" he asked, but then trailed off, obviously not wanting to say 'the knife that the Dark Lord impaled your arm with when you were captured because you renounced him for the second time?'

"Yeah," said Draco.

Bill's face twisted into a grimace. "And you're actually studying it?"

"It saved my life," said Draco.

Bill put the knife down. "How's your arm doing?"

"Better," said Draco. "Have you been able to catch up on the dialects I've translated already?"

"That was a deliberate change of topic," said Bill, but he didn't press it any further.

Draco pulled out the journal of the Persian Runes, and flipped it open. He showed Bill the dialects he had translated already and the former professor caught onto the variations quite quickly. They were just debating the switch into the first dialect when Draco felt the first feelings of unease. He brushed it away and turned back to the runes, but the feeling returned. It was an unsettling brush all around him, like the room was suddenly becoming electrically charged.

"What's wrong?" asked Bill, as Draco put down the quill he was writing with.

"Do you feel that?" asked Draco.

"Feel what?"

Draco took a step back from the table. "Something's not right."

"What do you mean not right?" asked Bill. "Are you hurt?"

"No, I'm fine, but-," he cut off as the electricity, or whatever it was in the room, seemed to spike. "Tell me you feel that."

"Feel what?" asked Bill.

"It's like…no, it can't be."

"Can't be what?" asked Bill.

Draco ignored him and pulled open the door, striding out of the room.

Fleur was sitting at the dining room table, her face pale while Mrs. Weasley knelt beside her, asking her if she was alright. Hermione and Ginny were there as well, an abandoned card game between them. Bill rushed to his wife's side even as Draco's suspicions were confirmed in his head. Fleur was half-Veela; she would be affected by the weather.

"You feel it too," said Draco.

She looked over at him and nodded.

"Feel what?" asked Bill.

Draco didn't answer. Instead he turned and half-ran out of the dining room, making for the front door. He burst out, noting the few Muggles on the street, but they didn't take note of him until he reached the sidewalk.

It was windy and cold and overcast, a typical December day in England, but the feeling of something not quite right was stronger outside. He gazed up and stared.

The clouds were dark, and rolling across the sky at an impressive rate, but that wasn't what had Draco staring. The clouds were traveling against the wind. It was as if some other force was pulling them back, pulling them so that they were positioned over London.

By now the Muggles on the street were looking up as well, wondering what he was staring at, and he vaguely registered their exclamations and gasps. Bill joined him outside, as did Ginny and Hermione.

Even now, the wind was picking up, and the clouds were growing darker, taking on an almost green tinge. The Muggles around them gave up staring and started running for cover.

"What is that?" Bill asked. He was almost yelling to be heard over the wind.

"It's a storm," Draco shouted back. "A storm created by magic, and look where the worst of it is."

He pointed towards the center of the city where the clouds were black and swirling. The storm was covering all of London, but it was directed at the middle of the capitol, directed right where the Ministry of Magic was stationed. A real storm wouldn't affect the Ministry, but a magical storm could do quite a lot of damage.

The street lights flickered on, and then off. Then on again, but this time they sparked and a few bulbs shattered. Hermione gave a surprised shriek.

"Let's get inside," said Bill.

He didn't have to tell Hermione or Ginny twice, and the littlest Weasley was looking particularly pale. Draco didn't move.

"Draco!"

Draco didn't respond. He wanted to know just what spells had been used to create this storm, and even if this was a magical disturbance, shouldn't the clouds still be blowing in the same direction as the wind?

The rain started suddenly and without any warning sprinkles first. It went from dry to deluge in a second, immediately soaking his hair and shirt. A bolt of lightning flashed a few streets down and the light was blinding, ten times more intense than a normal bolt. The thunder that accompanied cracked so loudly Draco felt his heart pound in his chest, and then the remaining street lights burst.

A hand closed around his right arm, and then Bill was pulling him inside.

"What do you think you are doing?" he demanded.

"A magically caused storm shouldn't do that," said Draco. "It shouldn't be this big either."

Behind him the door opened and Arthur Weasley and Kingsley Shacklebolt stumbled in, completely drenched.

"They evacuated the Ministry," said Arthur. "Dumbledore felt something was off, and Severus got us the news just in time. About half of the workers got out before the Floo fizzled out; the rest had to take the visitor entrances."

"Fizzled out?" asked Bill.

"Yes," said Arthur, heading into the kitchen. The rest followed him. "The entire Floo network completely shut down."

"Arthur!" Molly Weasley exclaimed, greeting her husband with a hug and kiss.

Draco noticed how their expressions both lighted up when they saw each other, and how Mrs. Weasley seemed relieved that her husband was home and safe. It was completely demonstrative, showing a deep affection, and right out in the open, which Draco never thought was a good idea, but for some reason, right then, it was almost touching.

"And look at you, completely soaked," the woman fussed. She pulled out her wand, intent on casting a few drying charms no doubt, but Draco spoke up.

"Using spells and magic right now isn't a good idea."

Everyone turned to look at him, so he pulled out his own, pointed it towards the door, and tried a simple lighting spell. At first, the light shone in a steady, bright beam, but then there was a crack of lightning and his wand sparked, the light exploding from the tip, nearly blinding the room before it spluttered out.

"We should also gather in a room that has the fewest number of magical objects because the storm is going to activate them, or worse."

"The living room," said Mrs. Weasley.

Sirius, Harry, and Ron were already in this room, having pulled back the drapes over the large window so they could watch the storm. They welcomed the rest in with grins.

"Have you seen this?" Ron asked his father. "It's wicked."

"It is wicked," said Arthur, "in the most literal sense of the word."

"You mean this is Voldemort?" asked Harry.

"The dark magic monitors were off the chart in the Auror department," said Kingsley. "They called in all the warders they could in hopes to save most of the Ministry, but this storm is powerful. No weather spells should be able to create this size of a storm, not even the darkest ones."

"They didn't create it," said Draco. He crossed closer to the window. "This is the storm from last night. They're pulling it back."

"How can you tell?" asked Hermione.

"See the wind? Now look at the clouds."

There was a short silence.

"The clouds are moving the other way," said Harry. "That's not natural."

"It must be some sort of localized time-distortion spell," said Draco.

"I've never read anything like this," said Hermione.

"This is completely new," said Draco. "Innovative, even."

"Time control doesn't run this way though," said Hermione. "Yes, we can send people in the past, but that's completely different from taking a past event and pulling it in reverse."

"This is ground-breaking in time control," agreed Draco. "And for the spell to only affect the atmosphere is astounding as well, although, actually that was probably the only factor they could control to such an extent. Running anything living in an essential reverse is ridiculous, even in theory, because that would mean they would have to run life backwards. They also had to use some rather strong weather spells. Nebulosa, to start with, but they would have had to add a time spell." He paused for a second. "That's not right because a time spell would have to be focused on an item. Scrap that, they would have started with a containment field, then the weather spells, nebulosa and a few darker ones. I'll actually have to read the weather reports to figure out which ones. Then the time spells, maybe even a time turner. If they could have anchored the shield in place with a physical object, and wrapped that in a time turner, and with the right accompanying spells," he paused again, taking in the enormity of what he had just figured out. "That's incredible. Of course, they would have to have a large field to do this, and somewhere up north, because they would have to harness the storm after it past. I can run this in theory, and figure out how long it would have taken to control the storm and send it backwards. The storm was moving pretty quickly, forty miles an hour, maybe, which means I can take that time and trace the storm, and figure out where they started the reverse. Shouldn't be too hard if-,"

He suddenly was aware that he had said that all out loud and that the Order was staring at him. He flushed; he knew he did, and he was thankful that the magical lamps decided to go out in that moment, plunging the room into shadow. Only the light from the window shone in, and with the cloud coverage, that light was dim.

He could hear Sirius and Kingsley laugh somewhere near Harry, and Bill had the audacity to smirk at him.

"Well, I guess he was right about being a genius," said Sirius. "I couldn't understand half of what he said."

He flushed further, stepping back from the window, and the next bolt of lightning lit up the sky enough so that he could see the entire room. Everyone was crowded around the window, drawn in by the flurry of the storm. Even Fleur was sitting on the chair closest to the window. Ginny Weasley, however, was sitting on the sofa in the back of the room, sitting in a relaxed pose, but her hand was clutching a throw pillow and her jaw was set.

Draco slipped back from the window during the next spectacular display of lightning and crossed over to Ginny. He sat in the armchair beside the couch.

"Scared, Weasley?" he asked, his voice not mocking or condemning, just even.

"No," Ginny responded, but her voice was a little too forceful.

"Not exactly convincing," he told her.

"I'm not trying to convince you."

"No, you're just trying to convince yourself, aren't you?"

Her eyes flashed, throwing Draco off for a moment. She was scared, but he didn't think she was that affected by being afraid. She was about to respond but there was a crash of thunder and she clenched the pillow tighter. Her breath was hitching now and she was so tense she was trembling; she wasn't scared, she was terrified.

A peculiar picture passed through Draco's head in that moment, a picture in which he reached out and took her hand, only to pull her closer to him, his arm wrapping around her back where he could feel her warm, smooth skin through her t-shirt, and he pressed her close to him, protecting her…

"Don't you dare look at me like that!" Ginny hissed suddenly and Draco started. How did she know what he was thinking? She couldn't have had that picture of him and her in mind as well.

"I am fine," Ginny continued in a harsh whisper, as to not attract attention from the rest of her family. "I don't need your sympathy or your comfort, alright?"

He thought back, trying to remember if he had let anything from his facial features slip, and he realized that he had let his guard down slightly. She must have picked up on his…what? Protectiveness? Since when did he feel protective over anyone? Besides Laney of course, but this wasn't just protection he was feeling for Ginny Weasley, this was something…more.

Screw that, he didn't feel anything for her. He didn't do innocent, remember?

He affected a cold expression. "I am a Malfoy. We don't do sympathy."

"You're not exactly a Malfoy anymore though, are you?"

The barb struck, and he cataloged a grudging recognition of her words as well as the sting. He hadn't thought her capable of such a remark, but he could see, in the dim light, that little bit of darkness in her eyes was taking precedence. He had obviously interrupted when she was battling some personal demon, and she had lashed out. The question was, what demon could a sixteen year old Weasley have?

He wanted to delve deeper. His curiosity was one of his weakest links in his guard. After all, hadn't it been part curiosity that had him join Bill that first evening after Ancient Runes class? He had been intrigued, wondering what the eldest Weasley boy could have that would interest him, but he had also wondered what it would be like for someone to know his secret, for someone who he could talk with. And now look where he was, in the Order of the Phoenix with over twenty people that knew his secret. And so yes, he was curious. He wanted to know exactly what dark secret Ginny Weasley was hiding.

Draco tried peering deeper, but than there was a gasp from one of the people by the window. He turned to see Fleur Weasley doubled over, clutching at her round belly while the Order grouped around her.

"Fleur, what is it?" asked Bill.

"The baby," Fleur managed between gasps. "The baby's coming."

"We have two weeks," said Bill sounding panicked.

"Not any more," said Fleur, then she cut off another moan.

Draco frowned. He didn't think contractions were supposed to come that close together so soon.

"What do we do?" asked Bill, but Mrs. Weasley was already barking orders.

"Get every candle you can find and bring it in here. Spread some blankets on the floor, and get some pillows. We also need towels, clean towels."

Hermione and Harry grabbed the blankets; Ron ran upstairs; Sirius went to get the candles. It took a few moments, but when the room was finally lit with over thirty candles, Fleur was half-reclined on the floor, panting and sweating. Mrs. Weasley held one hand, trying to get Fleur to mimic her breathing, but there were too many people, too much confusion.

Kingsley knelt down beside them. "My partner's wife gave birth at home. I was there because he was away on a mission. They had a mid-wife, but I helped."

"Good," said Molly, "because I've only been on the birthing end."

There was another bolt of lightning. Fleur gasped again.

"The baby, something's wrong."

"What's wrong?" asked Bill, brushing the hair away from her forehead.

"My baby's not moving anymore. I can't feel him moving!"

Kingsley pressed his hand on Fleur's womb, but he shook his head. "I can't tell."

Bill swept the room with his eyes, trying to find someone who knew what to do. His gazed locked with Draco's.

"Draco, please tell me you've read about this."

"Read about it, yes," said Draco, shaking his head, "but years ago."

"But you said you never forget."

"Reading and doing are two completely different things-," Draco started, trying to explain that he didn't think he would be of any help.

"You healed Snape's lung."

"That was a lung, not childbirth," Draco tried to argue, but Bill's eyes were desperate. He was pleading.

"Draco, please."

Draco took a breath, calling up everything he could in his mind. Sweet Merlin, there must be someone better suited for this than him. He could do a quick fix, yes, but actually help Fleur give birth? He hated most children, he was terrible at caring for things, and even his flobberworms in Hagrid's class could never seem to reproduce. Did Bill understand that?

"I'm not a Healer, Bill."

"But right now you're the only person who has the faintest idea of what to do."

Draco looked around to see that Bill was right. "I'm not making any promises," he said, and walked forward. He knelt by Fleur and placed a hand on her womb. She was right, the baby wasn't moving. He reached out with a bit of magic. It wasn't wandless magic, just a searching of life from one magical creature to another. He would have liked to do a spell, but a wand created a concentrated force, something that the lightning would affect and distort. The baby's heartbeat was faint and erratic. There was the faint buzz of electricity, and he pulled his magic back just as there was a bolt of lightning. When he reached out again, the heartbeat was fainter.

"I need hot water and soap," he began, rolling up his sleeves. "We have to get the environment as sterile as possible. I also need every potion and medical kit you can find. Ron, throw me some of those towels."

Ron did so and Draco spread the towels underneath Fleur's legs.

"I also need the room as empty as possible, so if you're not doing anything vital, you can leave."

The room cleared out and Draco got up as well.

"Bill, help Fleur take her trousers off," he said, not exactly wanting to do so himself. He was a little uncomfortable with this.

"Yeah," said Bill.

Draco walked back a few steps and Kingsley joined him.

"The baby's heartbeat is erratic," he told the Auror quietly. "And her water hasn't even broken yet. Veela's are affected by the weather, and Fleur's part Veela and witch, so this magical storm is affecting her even more. I don't think the baby's going to survive a natural birth, not when we have no professional help."

Kingsley looked grave, glancing over at Fleur on the floor. "Can we do anything?"

Draco gave a short laugh, but it was cold. "There are always options. The question is, which one is less likely of killing any of them?"

"At times like this, you ask the mother. Only she has the right to choose," said Kingsley.

Draco nodded, swallowing hard. He had known that of course, but the mother almost always chose the option that had the best odds for the baby, discounting her own health. The father almost never understood. His reluctance must have shown in his eyes because Kingsley spoke again.

"The only way he would hate you is if you did nothing."

Draco glanced up, but then Bill's voice brought him back.

"Draco, her water broke!"

Draco turned, seeing the towel draped over Fleur's hips for privacy and then the liquid soaking the towels under her and wondering, for a split second, if maybe he wouldn't have to tell them anything, but then he came closer. The liquid wasn't supposed to be that pink, and more red was leaking out. Fleur was bleeding.

"This is good, right?" Bill was asking, not seeing the blood and taking Fleur's hand again. Fleur knew the truth, however, women usually did. She was looking at him, and the worried, scared expression in her eyes told him she knew what he was going to say.

"Fleur," said Draco calmly, "the storm is affecting you and your child. Right now you are bleeding and I can't risk any spells to stop that. Your baby will most likely not survive a live birth; the trauma will kill it. That leaves us with two options. You can give birth normally and hope for the best, or I can try a Caesarian, cutting you open and taking the baby out. Caesarians are performed every day in Muggle hospitals, however I have no equipment. The baby will most likely survive the surgery, but it could be dangerous for you. I have to know your decision."

"No," said Bill. "No way you are performing surgery on her." His tone was flat, hard.

"Bill," said Draco, looking him in the eye. "It's not your decision."

"No," said Bill, turning to Fleur. "Sweetie, don't. Ddon't risk it."

She looked up at him and smiled through her pain. "It's our baby," she told him. "I can't do that." She looked at Draco. "Try the Caesarian."

Draco nodded.

The door open and Hermione hurried in, her arm full of potions and medical kits. She piled them on the floor and went to leave but Draco stopped her.

"Granger, I need a knife," he said and upon hearing Bill's sharp intake of breath, "also a Muggle radio if you have one. One with battery power."

"I have one, but what for?"

"Just get it, quickly."

Mr. Weasley entered the room with a pot full of steaming water and a bar of soap. He set it a few feet away from Fleur, and Draco made sure that his sleeves were properly rolled up. His shirt was still wet from his trip outside and so the material wasn't moving. He plunged his hands in the water and then lathered up before rinsing. Kingsley followed suit. Sirius came in with another pot of hot water.

"Put it beside Fleur," said Draco, "but not too close."

Hermione came in with the radio and Harry entered with an arm full of knives. "We didn't know what you needed them for, so…," he put them beside the hand washing water.

"Granger, put the radio by Bill and play something soothing," said Draco. "Potter, send in Ginny, will you? Granger, stay here as well."

Hermione found a radio station playing soft jazz and then Ginny came in, shutting the door behind her.

"I need you two to grab a blanket and hold it as a screen," said Draco.

"A screen, for what?" asked Hermione.

"Ever hear of a c-section?" asked Draco.

"A what? You can't do that!" Hermione exclaimed.

"The storm's affecting the baby, and this is the only way to be sure that it lives." He picked through the bottles of potion and found quite a few localized pain relievers, two anti-bacterial cleansers, and a sleep-aid. He couldn't make a numbing potion out of this. He looked up at Ginny. "Can you do this?" he asked.

She nodded, her face set. He knew she would pull through if needed.

"Good," he said.

Bill watched as Ginny and Hermione held up a blanket between them, the bottom draping over Fleur's chest and then stretching so that her lower half was cut off. He gripped Fleur's hand tighter. He couldn't see what Draco was doing; he didn't think he wanted to.

"It's going to be okay," he told her. "It's going to be fine."

"Fleur," came Draco's voice, "I'm applying a crude form of numbing potion to your stomach. If it hurts, just let me know, and I can put some more on, alright?"

He sounded so calm, as if he was merely putting a bandage on a paper cut. It was reassuring, but Bill wondered how nervous he really was.

Fleur flinched at something, and he was immediately bending closer.

"Does it hurt?" he asked.

"Cold," she said. "Surprised me."

She suddenly gasped and tensed. Another contraction.

"Fleur," said Draco from somewhere beyond the blanket. "Do not tense up. I know it's hard, but you have to fight back the contraction, okay? Just relax, it's going to be okay, but you have to relax."

Fleur nodded, her face dripping with sweat. She never sweated before; she said that if anything, ladies 'glistened'. Bill hated to see her like this, and there were sounds beyond the curtain, sounds of knives and he didn't want to listen. He turned up the radio, blocking out whatever Draco and Kingsley were doing.

"Fleur, you love this song," he said, moving so that he was sitting, not kneeling, his back to the blanket. She looked up at him, biting back a gasp and a cry.

"Just listen," he said.

Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away…

Fleur screwed up her face and there was the soft sound of a knife cutting through flesh. She gasped. Bill, sitting closest to the blanket, could just make out Draco's voice.

"Kingsley, getting the numbing potion, and soak the skin as much as possible. It's most effective right as it sits in, so I'm going to follow you with the knife. Watch your fingers."

"Got it," said Kingsley's deep voice.

Bill tuned them out, not wanted to hear what was happening. He wife was in pain, and he could do a thing. He could only hold her hand.

Come fly with me, let's take off into the blue….

He mouthed the words to her, rubbing her hand now. There was a muffled curse from behind the curtain, Draco's voice. No one else said 'merde' quite like he did. There was a squelching noise and he nearly gagged. He concentrated on the song and on Fleur's face. He mouthed the words to her.

Once I get you up there, where the air is rarified…

Her face screwed up again; he swallowed hard. He could hear Kingsley say something to Draco in a quickened tone, but so quietly Bill couldn't make out the words. He did catch the tone thought. Worried. Unsure. Afraid.

We'll just glide, starry-eyed, once I get you up there…

Fleur groaned. He couldn't hear Draco or Kingsley anymore. What were they doing? Did something go wrong? Was it all too late?

Please, no, he thought silently.

Fleur gasped, her hand tightening on Bill's.

Take the baby if you have too, Bill thought. Take the baby, but not my wife. Not my wife, please.

I'll be holding you so near, we'll hear the angels cheer – just because we're together…

There was a loud cry, a child's cry, a baby's cry. For a second everyone looked over at the blanket, and then the cry hiccupped and continued. Fleur gave a gasping laugh and Bill laughed as well, wondering if maybe this would all turn out alright after all. His gaze locked with Fleur's and he saw tears in her blue eyes.

"That's our baby!" she said.

His mother was laughing now, patting Fleur's hand, reaching over to grab Bill's free one. He could see Ginny and Hermione watching the going on's behind the blanket and they were both staring. He could just hear Draco's, 'Merlin, I hate children', and then Kingsley ducked around the blanket, a bundle in his hands. It was a bloody, tiny bundle, wrapped up in a soft towel and there was a red, wrinkled face peeping out from the folds. It appeared to be trying to scream its face off.

"It's a boy," said Kingsley, gently placing the bundle in Molly's hands. Bill could see Fleur straining to see her baby, to hold her baby, and he wondered why Kingsley hadn't given the baby to her. Why hadn't he given the baby to him? Why was Kingsley looking so somber? He looked back at his wife and he knew why. Fleur was pale, too pale.

"Kingsley, get the hell back here!" came Draco's voice.

Bill completely forgot about the miracle of birth. "What's going on?" he demanded. "What's wrong?"

"Did you see our baby?" asked Fleur, turning to him with a smile on her face, but her eyes were glazing. "Our pretty baby?"

Bill looked across at his mother who was holding his child, his son, in her arms but she was looking at Fleur in alarm.

"No," said Bill. He scrambled to his feet, darting around Hermione so that he could see what was happening. He almost wished he hadn't because he had no desire to see inside a person, but it was his wife. He needed to know. "What happened?"

"She's bleeding out," said Draco. He was holding something blood soaked, and Bill had to look away.

"Is she going to be okay?" he asked.

"Not if I can't get the bleeding stopped, and I could get the bleeding stopped if it would just stop storming outside," Draco's voice was curt. He was worried.

Bill was about to ask what the hell the storm had to do with anything, when suddenly he saw. There was a bolt of lightning and Fleur jerked. Draco swore, grabbing another towel.

"Why the storm?" asked Bill.

"Because Veela's are affected by the weather, but Fleur's also a witch, so the magic and the storm combined are playing havoc with her body which is already in a state of shock due to the rather intrusive surgery just performed," Draco snapped back.

"Bill?"

That was Fleur and Bill ran back to kneel in front of Fleur. "What is it?" he asked, cupping her face.

"I just...," Fleur trailed off, her eyes staring at something he couldn't see.

"No!" said Bill. "Fleur, honey, stay awake, stay focused!"

Her eyes turned to his. "Did you see our baby? So beautiful, so…beautiful."

"No, Fleur, baby, stay with me, okay? Stay with me?" He was begging now.

"I just wish…just wish it would stop storming," said Fleur, in a day-dreaming voice. She didn't know what she was saying.

There was a beat and then Draco ground out "Stupide!" It was with the French pronunciation, and it sounded as if he was criticizing himself. "Kingsley," Draco's voice demanded. "How good are you at healing charms?"

"I thought the storm prevented magic."

"If I found a way to block out the storm, could you fix her?"

A pause. "Yes," said Kingsley.

"Good," said Draco. "Just don't report me. Bill, Granger, Weasley, get back."

Everyone looked over at him, or over at the blanket that still separated them.

"Get back to the edges of the room," Draco demanded again. "Now. All of you."

Ginny and Hermione obeyed, as did Molly, gently holding the bundle which was still screaming away, letting them know that the baby was alive. Bill looked over at Draco who was now visible, the screen gone. His hands were covered with blood, all the way up to his elbows, and Kingsley was similarly splattered.

"I'm staying here," said Bill.

Draco nodded, then turned to Kingsley. "When I put the shield up, start."

"Shield?" asked Kingsley. "What-?"

Draco pulled out his wand, and after the next bout of lightning, called out "Contego!"

A blue, shimmering light suddenly burst around the four, holding them in a dome.

"Start healing," said Draco.

"What is this?" asked Bill, even as Kingsley pulled out his wand and started muttering incantations.

"A shielding spell," said Draco. "Particularly good at blocking dark spells, and at the moment, that's what the storm is, that is what's making the magic go haywire. Because it is a shield spell-,"

He cut off as a bolt of lightning illuminated the room, but it seemed to reflect off the shield, and Fleur didn't move. Draco swallowed, as if forcing something unpleasant away.

"Well, it does that," he said. "Kingsley, how is it going?"

"I stopped the bleeding, but I can't close this."

Bill glanced over at Draco who was frowning.

"Did you try integro?"

"And resarcio," said Kingsley, "but look."

Draco leaned forward, but Bill didn't. The sight of Fleur's blood was making him ill.

"What now?" asked Kingsley.

"Try resarcio again, sometimes it just needs another go."

Kingsley nodded and tried the spell. There was a violent bout of lightning, as storms are bound to do as they are dying out. It made Bill jump at the shock. The shield flickered once, Fleur gasped in pain, Kingsley called out 'Draco!' The blue light solidified.

"Sorry," said Draco, but his voice was strained. "Did it work?"

"No, and she's bleeding again."

"Kingsley, have you ever used 'contego'?"

"No, but I can. It's something they teach us for special battles even though the official stance is that the spell is banned."

"Good. I need you to call up a shield under mine."

"What are you going to do?"

"Drop my shield and use 'percuro'."

"If you haven't used that spell before-,"

"I have, and Snape is fine."

Kingsley frowned but Bill spoke up. "That's the one you used on his lung."

Draco nodded.

"Alright," said Kingsley, and then he pulled up an additional shield. Draco let his own fade out and then he pressed his wand on Fleur's stomach. He cast the curse silently, but it was easy to see that it was working. Bill watched, entranced, as Fleur's breaths started deepening. A bit of color came into her face even as Draco paled, just like he had when he healed Snape.

Bill knew why; these spells used the caster's energy to heal the other. That was why so many potions were used now instead of spells.

Draco broke the spell off after a minute, taking in a breath and bracing himself with a hand on the floor.

"Draco," said Bill, worried for the boy.

"She's just sleeping," said Draco, misunderstanding the concern in his voice. He reached out and grabbed Fleur's wrist, pressing two fingers on the underside. He was silent for a few moments, but then released Fleur's hand. "Her pulse is steady," he said.

"The rain is stopping," said Kingsley, looking through the blue light to the window, but it was still apparent that the storm was ending because the outside sky was growing lighter.

Kingsley let the blue light disappear, the strain on his face easing as well. Bill turned to Draco, not liking the fact that the boy was so pale, but at the same time, completely grateful. He caught Draco's gaze, all of his thanks and gratitude and relief in his eyes and Draco nodded.

Bill opened his mouth the say something, but then his mother came forward and placed the tiny bundle in his arms. Bill stared at his son who blinked up at him with the widest eyes Bill had ever seen.

And of course the song is 'Come Fly with Me', sung first by Sinatra and then by Michael Buble, or however you spell his name. So, crazy chapter, and in the next, we learn what they name the baby. Leave one (a review, not a baby).





4. A Cryptic Message

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, paying my college tuition wouldn't be such a big deal.

Author's note: Hey. I am so sorry for making you all wait a month. It has just been crazy around here, not a bad crazy exactly, but just hectic. So, apologies again, thank you to all of my reviewers, and here's the next chapter.

p.s. Did I mention I was sorry?

Kingsley let the 'contego' shield drop. The room brightened in an instant, the shades of red coming into view now that the blue dome was gone. Draco glanced outside and saw the clouds thinning, now white instead of grey. He looked back down to Fleur, but caught Bill's gaze instead.

The hazel eyes were thankful, more than thankful, and Draco nodded, but more out of relief. He was a genius, not a surgeon, and the fact that Fleur actually pulled through was more testimony to a mother's strength and pure, damn luck.

Bill opened his mouth, no doubt about to annunciate his gratitude, but then Molly Weasley was there, handing over the crying infant to his father. Draco watched as Bill held his son, the newborn's cries slowly subsiding, and the two just stared at each other. The rest of the room stared at them, grinning sappily. Altogether, it was an emotive, touching scene that Draco could have done without.

He rolled his eyes and then scourgified the blood off of his hands and arms. It took him two tries and he frowned. He needed a strong cup of coffee, or a shot of Ogden's whiskey. Or a sip of Angel Flight.

Draco paused at that unbidden thought, but instead of pushing it away, he turned it over carefully in his mind, examining it. He was pleased to determine that it was only slightly stronger than a whim. The knowledge of the drug was always in his mind; whenever he drank an alcoholic beverage, he always knew he could go one step further. The thought of Angel Flight was more pressing than that knowledge, but only by a hair. It was an itch in the back of his mind, and Draco could easily ignore an itch. In a few days, it would fade.

He really could use a cup of coffee though - he was completely drained. Calling up the shield took energy, and using the healing charm was akin to giving blood, but instead of a transfusion of red blood cells, he was giving a bit of his magical reserves. He could always go to bed a bit early to recover thought, so he wasn't too worried.

There were suddenly voices in the other room, or rather, those who were in the dining room became louder, and Draco could distinguish the even tones of Albus Dumbledore. The door into the living room opened and the Headmaster stepped in, quickly crossing to Fleur.

He preformed an advanced diagnostic charm and then looked to Bill and preformed the same on the baby.

"Molly," he said, not looking up from the child, "would you Floo over to the school, the infirmary entrance, all the others are not yet operational, and ask Poppy to come over. I think she will be able to look after Fleur now that all of the excitement is over."

"The school nurse?" inquired Mrs. Weasley.

"Poppy's been aware of our little group for some time now," said Dumbledore, as Mrs. Weasley got up to leave. "Merlin knows I can't put much past her." He suddenly twinkled as the newborn flailed a tiny arm. "And Poppy will take a look at you too, yes she will, although I think she will find you perfectly healthy." He pronounced the last with a soft touch to the baby's nose.

Draco wondered what it was about babies that caused adults to beam ridiculously. And the high 'baby' voices were obnoxious as well. Yes, children did hear higher-pitched frequencies better than low ones, but honestly, it was an infant. It really didn't understand anything that was said to it.

"A boy?" asked Dumbledore to Bill.

"Yes," said Bill.

"He is a beautiful child," said Dumbledore. "Who preformed the caesarian?"

Bill looked over to Draco and Dumbledore smiled. "Of course. Do you have an interest in Healing, Draco?"

Draco would have shrugged, but he was too tired. "I read the concept in a book once."

"You appear to be quite adept for simply reading about the procedure."

"It's really just knowing the human anatomy."

"Have you ever considered a career in Healing?"

Draco raised an eyebrow and snorted.

Pomfrey bustled into the room, immediately kneeling next to Fleur and casting half a dozen different, detailed diagnostic charms. She looked up at the room in irritation.

"I'm with a patient."

Ginny and Hermione made their way out of the room, being besieged by the rest of the Weasley clan once they left the door, but then Dumbledore stepped out and seemed to disperse the crowd. Draco took Kingsley's proffered hand and allowed himself to be hoisted to his feet. There was a moment of dizziness, but he had prepared for it and managed to walk out the door without swaying. His inner ear found his balance by the time he reached the dining room, and Charlie Weasley slipped past him and into the living room before the door shut.

Dumbledore had sent the rest of the family upstairs to check for damage caused by the storm and Draco was relieved at the lack of people. He didn't think he was up to answering any questions. He walked straight into the kitchen and fumbled for the coffee.

Dumbledore neatly swiped the can from him and then firmly guided him back into the dining room. Draco didn't offer much resistance but sat in the chair the Headmaster directed him towards. Dumbledore summoned a chocolate bar from the kitchen, unwrapped it, and set it in front of Draco.

"Eat this," said Dumbledore. "Hermione, if you wouldn't mind, I think you could all do with a spot of tea?"

"Of course," said Hermione. Ginny followed her into the kitchen to help.

Draco broke off a square of the chocolate and bit into it. It was a good brand, not too sweet. He wondered how much of the comfort he felt was really from the cocoa and how much of it was purely psychological, but he was too tired to do much more than wonder. He broke off a second piece.

"How's the Ministry, Kingsley?" Dumbledore asked, summoning the Auror his own chocolate bar because the Auror was looking worn.

"Impossible to tell," said Kingsley. "The storm was just getting started when we were evacuated, but even then…," he trailed off and shook his head. "They brought in all of the warders they could to pull up shields so hopefully that helped some. I hear you felt the storm coming a long way off."

"It is one of the benefits of old age," said Dumbledore. "My right knee aches when a storm is coming and my left throbs in the presence of strong dark magic."

"So both of them ached then?"

"No," said Dumbledore. "My toes were particularly tender this morning."

The two Gryffindor girls returned with the tea, Ginny setting a mug in front of Draco with a small smile.

"Ah, thank you, Hermione," said Dumbledore, as he accepted his own mug and then he turned back to Kingsley. "I realized something was causing my toes to ache later in the day and Severus realized something was wrong after a few of his more volatile potions reacted so he made a few inquires. It turns out Tom has been more active than we first thought. We understood the small amount of revels and raids to be an indication that he hadn't gained the necessary support for something larger, but now it appears he was just hiding 'under the radar', as the Muggles say."

"The storm didn't really make your toes ache though, did it?" asked Hermione awkwardly. She obviously felt inquiring after the Headmaster's toes was rude, but curiosity wouldn't let her keep silent.

"The storm was made of dark spells," Dumbledore explained. "After repeated exposure to such magic, one requires a certain feel for the curses, much like older fishermen can tell when a storm is coming even when the skies are clear."

"Is that how you knew?" asked Ginny.

There was a pause and Draco looked up from his tea to see that she was staring at him expectantly.

"Oh." He gave a half shrug. "I'm familiar with dark magic, so yeah, I was more attuned to the storm."

"Draco here has already dissected half of the storm," said Kingsley to Dumbledore.

"Not really," said Draco. "It's just a theory."

"Still, quite an accomplishment," said Dumbledore. "We'll have to let you poke about a bit at the Ministry then and see if you can't find out more about the storm."

Draco nodded, actually quite excited about having a chance to survey the damage. The living room door opened and Pomfrey stepped out.

"I thought you would like to know that Bill and Fleur have a healthy son, fifteen inches long and seven pounds. A little small, but that isn't surprising."

"And Fleur?" asked Ginny.

"Sore, exhausted, and a little tender, but the surgery, while crude, went incredibly well. She'll be off her feet for a week, just to be on the safe side, and we'll be watching her for any sign of infection, but she'll recover. I am told that it is thanks to you, Mr. Malfoy, after using an illegal shield charm and a spell that requires certification from a medi-wizard to perform legally." Her tone was on the side of disapproving.

Draco met her gaze and raised an eyebrow. Pomfrey frowned.

"You do look a bit peaky," she said, crossing over to him and raising a hand to lay on his forehead. He jerked away.

"I'm fine."

"Let me be the judge of that," said Pomfrey. "It's amazing you aren't falling asleep right now. And look at you, you're soaking wet. What did you do? Stand outside in the storm?"

Draco looked down. He was still damp, wasn't he? The discomfort had been pushed out of mind when he had been delivering the baby, and afterwards the exhaustion had taken precedence. Now, however, he was experiencing the full irritation of damp clothing, but he merely shrugged.

"Only for a few minutes," he said.

Kingsley snorted and Pomfrey rounded on him.

"Don't think I haven't forgotten about you. You're next on the check up. There is a reason that spell is illegal."

She dug into her bag and pulled out a vial. "Drink," she told Draco.

Draco looked at the liquid before downing it. The potion was simply a blend of energy restoring drafts and vitamins, and he couldn't detect any sleep aids.

The living room door opened and Charlie stepped through.

"Fleur's finished the medicine," he said to the nurse.

"Good," said Pomfrey. She turned back to Draco. "I want you to take a hot shower after you finish that chocolate bar and then it's straight to bed, understand?"

"I was-," Draco started but the nurse frowned. He cut himself off as he realized that Dumbledore was echoing Pomfrey's unrelenting expression and he rolled his eyes.

"Fine."

He bit into another piece as she left, calculating exactly how long he could make the bar last. He frowned when he realized the room seemed to be revolving slowly in a clockwise manner. He wasn't that tired; he really wasn't. He blinked, forcing the room to a stand still, but then it began drifting the other way.

It took him a few moments to realize that Dumbledore and Kingsley were exchanging looks after glancing his way and they weren't even being coy. They really didn't have to with how spacey he was being at the moment.

He stood. "I'm heading up."

He moved towards the stairs, but then Charlie was there.

"You need some help?" the red-haired dragon keeper asked.

"Unless I suddenly revert to a state of being reminiscent to my toddler years, no, I should be able to navigate a flight of stairs with a successful result."

Charlie grinned but his cheeks reddened slightly. Draco took a small amount of pity on him.

"Bill told you to check up on me, didn't he?"

"He's a little worried," Charlie admitted.

"Tell him I'm fine."

Draco continued up the stairs, stopping by his room to grab a pair of clean sweat pants and a worn t-shirt before continuing to the bathroom. He was relieved to strip off his wet clothes, and even more relieved to step into the hot shower. His back stung under the spray; his burns were almost healed, but still a little tender.

He checked them as well as he could when he stepped out of the shower, turning around and straining to see the reflection in the mirror that had an anti-steam charm on it, mostly likely put on by one of the girls in the house. It was only when he looked at the tattoo that the silence in the back of his mind was noticeable. It had been busy in the house, and for the noise and distraction, he was grateful.

He pulled on the loose pajama pants, giving the burns one last check. They could use a little more salve, but that would mean finding someone to help him which would mean letting someone see. He pulled on his t-shirt; the salve wasn't necessary.

There was a knock on the door.

"I'm out," he said, pulling the door open, expecting to see Ginny or Hermione standing there. Instead it was Sirius.

"How are you doing?" the man asked.

Draco immediately knew by the look in his eyes what he was talking about. "It's loud here," he said simply.

Sirius gave a wry grin. "It usually isn't this eventful," he said, but then stopped and reconsidered. "Alright, so there's usually something going on, but this is the first time a baby's been born in the middle of a freak storm."

Draco felt a half-smile tug at the corner of his lip.

"How's your back?" asked Sirius suddenly. He held up a small jar of burn salve. "I thought you could use this, and I figured you wouldn't want anyone else to, well, it is…personal, and hard for other people to understand who haven't grown up with the culture."

Draco hesitated, but then nodded. Sirius unscrewed the lid and Draco pulled off his shirt. Sirius applied the balm and then taped gauze over it.

"Thanks," said Draco, pulling his shirt back on.

"I think your back should be fine after this," said Sirius, "but if you need an ear, or a voice, let me know."

Draco nodded and Sirius walked off. Draco grabbed his wet things and then walked down the hall to his room. He threw the clothes into a pile and shut the door. He didn't bother pulling down the covers on the bed, but simply lay down. He drifted off within moments, something extraordinary for an insomniac.

He was standing in the entry room of the Department of Ministries, but the seven doors weren't revolving as they had when he had entered with Voldemort. Instead, they were stopped, and the door to the Veil was open. He could see inside, could see the cloth blowing in the invisible wind. He could also see that the door next to the Veil room was closed, but light was shining from underneath the bottom.

'So, you took our advice.'

Draco whirled around, but he couldn't see anyone there. 'Hello?'

'You know where we are; you just don't want to admit it.'

Draco turned back to the Veil. 'So I know where you are, but who are you?'

'The ones that urged you to follow the members of the light, even though you are not of life yourself.'

'So why did you?'

'We can gaze at possibilities.'

'And you thought we were a good match?' His tone was disbelieving.

'You are shadow, yes, but shadows cannot exist in the dark.'

'And what? You just wanted to give me some friendly advice?'

'You will be instrumental in the conflicts to come.'

'And you're rooting for the light, I take it.'

'Aren't you?'

'I was wondering if you were taking the stance of there needs to be a balance.'

'When good wins, who really looses?'

'Besides, the bad guys you mean.'

Amused laughter. 'We do not step into the affairs on your own plane, unless the conflict involves our own.'

'The Horcruxes,' said Draco.

'It is an evil that has the power to destroy your world. You must come back; there is more to discuss.'

'Why can't you tell me now?'

'The connection is fading.'

'What do you mean?'

'We can contact you like this because you came into contact with us, but the connection never lasts for long.'

'So why didn't you just tell me before?'

'We have our reasons.'

'That doesn't tell me anything.'

'The connection is fading; you must return.'

'You still haven't told me who you are.'

There was no answer and the room started blurring.

'Wait!'

But even as he started forward he jolted up from his bed, panting slightly and trying to orient himself. He ran a hand over his face and sighed.

"Shit," he said, feelingly.

He flopped back on the bed and stared at the ceiling, turning the dream over in his mind before pushing it away and glancing to the clock. It was eleven p.m. He had slept the entire day.

He tried closing his eyes again, wondering if he could fall back to sleep, but he was simply too awake, and his eyes kept blinking open. He groaned and sat up. There were always his projects downstairs to work on.

Draco pulled off his sleep pants and pulled on a pair of khaki trousers. He then put on a clean oxford over his t-shirt but didn't bother to do the buttons up the front. He was only wearing it to hide the scar on his arm. He left his room and headed down the stairs, surprised to find that there was light coming from the dining room as well as the soft murmur of voices.

He walked in to see Dumbledore and Bill talking over cups of tea, both looking up when he entered. Bill grinned.

"I told you he wouldn't sleep all night too," he told Dumbledore. He turned to Draco. "How are you feeling?"

Draco frowned at him. "Do you realize how many times I have been asked that question in the past two weeks? It's ridiculous, unnecessary, and tiresome."

"So is having you answer 'fine' every time I ask," Bill returned, but he was still grinning, so it meant he wasn't at all put off by Draco's snark.

"How is your family?" asked Draco, pulling out a chair and sitting. Dumbledore poured him a cup of tea and he accepted it with a nod.

"They're doing great," said Bill, his grin widening, though Draco didn't know how it was possible. "Of course, you realize that before long the entire Weasley family will owe you a life-debt?"

Draco snorted.

"I'm serious," said Bill. "First me, then Ron, now Fleur and the baby. And you saved Ginny from the ghoul that one time in school."

Draco shrugged and sipped at his tea.

"Draco," said Bill, "has anyone told you that you're incredible?"

"Pansy, on several occasions," said Draco, "as well as several other older female Slytherins and about half of the Ravenclaws girls who graduated last year."

Bill punched him lightly on the shoulder. "I'm being serious," he said. "You are amazing, and thank you, for everything."

Draco rolled his eyes, but he could feel his cheeks grow hot. He took another sip of his tea.

"You still haven't met the newest addition have you?" asked Bill.

"Bill, I pulled it out of your wife. We've met," said Draco dryly.

"But not properly," said Bill. "Come on."

He stood and headed for the door, clearly expecting Draco to follow him. Draco hesitated, but then he realized that Bill was looking…anticipatory? Did he really want that much for Draco to see his child? Did it really mean that much to him?

Draco got up, strangely touched that Bill seemed so eager.

"I don't want to wake anyone up," he said, lingering back.

"Fleur woke up a while ago," said Bill. "Come on."

And then Dumbledore was there, shooing Draco in as well, and Draco stepped into the room. Fleur was awake and sitting up on a transfigured bed, cocooned in pillows and blankets. She was smiling and holding her baby as Mrs. Weasley fawned over the both of them.

"Look who it is," Fleur told her baby in the high-pitched tones everyone uses when speaking to a baby. "Is that daddy? Yes, it is. Yes, it is."

Fleur and Mrs. Weasley both laughed delightedly when the baby sneezed.

"Come on," said Bill, dragging Draco closer to the bundle and the still-red face. "Well?" Bill asked, expectantly.

"Congratulations," said Draco.

Bill laughed, then lightly pushed him over to the chair right by the bed. "Sit here," he said.

Draco sat and looked at the Weasley in askance, but then Bill gently took the bundle from his wife. Draco immediately saw where this was headed.

"Oh no," he said, starting to get up. "Bill, no. Keep it away from me."

Bill just grinned and took a step forward so Draco couldn't leave the couch without brushing by him and Draco wasn't going to do that, not when Bill was carrying the baby.

"No," he said again. "Bill, I'll break it or something."

Bill laughed and stepped forward again and Draco had to sit down to avoid touching the infant and then Bill was holding him out. Draco was a genius, and so when holding the baby became inevitable, he let the child be placed in his arms and held it with a perfect form, if not a little gingerly. Once the baby was settled in the crook of his arm, he looked down at it and stared.

The boy was awake and staring up at him. Draco knew that babies couldn't see far when they were first born, but it looked as if the child was looking straight at him. It had clear blue eyes, eyes that would stay blue even as he grew older, and its hair was nothing more than orange fuzz. One free, tiny arm waved about as the child squirmed and then shut his eyes. Draco reached out with his free hand, intending on tucking the arm back inside the blanket, but then tiny, fragile fingers wrapped around his thumb and Draco froze. For such a small body, it seemed rather strong.

He looked up to see that everyone was watching him, stupid grins on their faces.

"Poor kid has your hair," he told Bill, just to break the mood.

"Yeah," said Bill, "but he's got his mother's eyes."

"I am glad he has your hair," said Fleur.

"Umm…I think it fell asleep," said Draco, trying to remove his finger, but the baby wasn't going to let go and he was afraid of waking it.

"It?" asked Bill. "It's a baby. You can't call him an 'it'."

"And yet you seem to be lacking a name for him," said Draco. "Still haven't decided then?"

Bill hesitated, glancing over at Fleur who nodded.

"Actually," he said, "we wanted to talk to you about that."

"You do realize, that while I am a genius, that does not mean I can come up with the perfect baby name, right?" he asked.

Dumbledore and Mrs. Weasley laughed; Bill ran a hand through his hair.

"Well, you saved his life," he said, "and you saved Fleur. I was wondering, we were wondering," he corrected himself, taking Fleur's hand, "if we could name the child after you, not Draco, because I have a feeling you'd hate that-,"

"It's a terrible name," agreed Draco. He had never been teased about it, because no one had the guts too, but it wasn't exactly a common name, even in the wizarding world.

"So, we wondering…what about Lukas?"

Draco blinked, and then stared down at the baby in his arms.

"I mean," Bill said quickly, "you can say 'no'. I understand completely if you didn't want us using that name, but I thought, well- we do owe you, and you can definitely let us know if we're over stepping our bounds, and -,"

"Yes," said Draco, looking up and cutting Bill off. Bill suddenly looked crestfallen, and Draco realized how his answer had sounded.

"I mean, no, you haven't over stepped the bounds," he corrected. "I would be honored if you named him Lukas."

Bill grinned. "Thank you. I've already started thinking of him as a Lukas."

"What's the middle name?" asked Draco.

"Arthur," said Fleur. "Lukas Arthur Weasley."

"You do realize that his initials spell 'law', right?" asked Draco.

Bill shrugged. "So we've already planned out his career and interests, nothing wrong with that." But his eyes were sparkling, which meant he was just teasing.

"Do you, uh," said Draco, nodding at the baby in his arms and looking up at Bill. "I'm not exactly…fond of babies."

"Better get used to it," said Bill, making no move to take his son. "We're making you godfather."

"Don't I get a choice?" asked Draco.

"'Course not," said Bill, and then he paused. "If you really didn't want," he started.

"No, I do," said Draco quickly, trying to wrap his mind around the fact that he was going to be godfather to the baby in his arms, and that Bill was naming him Lukas. He was overwhelmed and pleased all at once. "I'm just not babysitting," he told Bill, completely serious about that, at least, not until the kid was fifteen and could take care of himself. Who knew how badly he would mess the kid up?

"What about changing diapers?" asked Bill.

"Not ever," said Draco.

"Fair enough," said Bill.

"Could you take him now?" asked Draco, freeing his finger from the baby's grasp. "Before I drop him, or something?"

Bill laughed and then took his son from Draco. Already he was an expert at handling the baby, with a hand supporting the infant's neck and moving so gently Lukas didn't even stir. Fleur smiled at them both, but she looked tired, so Draco stood, giving Bill a half-smile in parting.

Mrs. Weasley was talking with the Headmaster at the door, but Dumbledore bid her good-night, and Draco moved to step out as well. Before he could, Mrs. Weasley reached out and gently took his hand, stopping him from leaving.

"You are a miracle," she told him sincerely. She kissed him on the cheek. "Thank you."

Draco left the room, a bit startled, and the Headmaster gave him a smile.

"Don't stay up too late, my boy," he said, and then threw some Floo in the fireplace and stepped through.

Draco ran a hand through his hair. He wasn't tired and there was no way he was going to be able to sleep, not after he had just slept the entire afternoon and evening away, so he went to his study and picked up the dagger.

Bill was up early because Lukas was. His son was hungry and he wanted everyone to know it. Bill passed his son to Fleur and after Lukas' early breakfast, both of them fell asleep once more.

Bill watched them for a few moments, both sleeping soundly on the large bed Dumbledore had transfigured for them. Fleur said it was the most comfortable mattress she had ever slept on, and Bill believed her. She never slept this deeply, but then again, she had never recovering from a c-section before either.

He slipped out of the room to find some breakfast for himself, and was surprised to see that his mother, Kingsley, Sirius, and Charlie were all up. The soundproofing charm Pomfrey had put around the living room to give Fleur some peace and quiet must really work.

"Ah, there's the new father," Kingsley greeted him, toasting to him with a mug of coffee.

"Doesn't look like a new father to me," said Sirius. "Isn't he supposed to be dead tired with graying hair?"

"It's just the first night," Kingsley rejoined. "Give him some time."

Charlie laughed along with them but then turned to his older brother.

"So, what's the name?" he asked. "Or did you just refuse to tell us what you had decided on a month ago because you had no idea?"

"We had no idea," Bill admitted. "But his name is Lukas Arthur."

"Lukas," said Kingsley. "That was Draco's half-brother, Laney's father, right?"

Bill nodded.

"It's a good name," said Kingsley and Sirius agreed.

"But you do realize that your kid's initials spell law, right?" he asked.

"Pushing him in any particular direction, Bill?" asked Kingsley.

Bill grinned. "Just a little bit." He noted that Kingsley wasn't wearing his Auror robes. "Day off Kingsley?"

"Until further notice," said Kingsley. "They're still trying to ascertain all of the damage at the Ministry and there are some Aurors at the secondary office, but the rest of us are off."

"Not just the Ministry was hit though," said Sirius. "St. Mungo's is in pretty bad shape as well." He passed the paper over and Bill looked at the front picture of the hospital. He whistled.

"Point to the Death Eaters on this one," said Kingsley. "Dumbledore is going over to the Ministry later today to help piece together the content of the storm. Do you think Draco will be up to traveling today?"

"I wouldn't even be able to begin to keep him here," said Bill. "And it's not as if he's already working too hard."

"Well, he is a Malfoy," said Sirius. "You didn't think he would be easy to get along with, did you?"

"Point," Bill allowed.

His mother came into the room with a fresh pot of tea.

"How's Fleur?" she asked.

"Sleeping," said Bill.

"Hey, Molly, do you need any help?" asked Sirius.

"We're all here with nothing to do," Kingsley chimed in.

Molly looked at them. "Do I want two bachelors in the kitchen with me trying to make breakfast? I'm going to say no." She laughed and then traveled back into the kitchen.

"I think she just insinuated that we were bad cooks, Kingsley," said Sirius.

"Everyone knows I can't cook," said the Auror, shrugging his large shoulders. "It doesn't need to be insinuated."

Breakfast only took a few more minutes, and the teens of the house surprised everyone by actually coming down without having to be woken up. Bill figured that they had been motivated by the prospect of seeing Lukas, because Pomfrey hadn't allowed any visitors yesterday, due to the risk of infection. He was proved correct when Fred and George turned to him expectantly.

"When can we see our nephew?" asked Fred.

"After breakfast," said Bill.

"Have you come up with a name yet?" asked Fred.

"It is Gred, right?" asked George, looking rather expectant.

Ron made a face. "If you did, I will claim no relation."

Hermione smacked him on the arm but Harry laughed.

"Lukas," said Bill. "Lukas Arthur Weasley."

"Lukas as in Draco's half-brother?" asked Ron.

Bill nodded.

"I like it," said Hermione, and the other Weasleys nodded as well. Ginny smiled but then scrunched up her nose.

"Are you trying to push him to become a lawyer?"

Bill sighed. "Yes, his initials spell 'law'. We're aware."

The table laughed at him and then Molly came in with a plate of toast.

"Where's Draco?" she asked.

"Wasn't in his room," said Harry.

"I know where he is," said Bill. He got up and walked down the hall to the back room. He pushed the door open and found the boy hunched over a notebook. It was immediately apparent that Draco hadn't gone to bed after waking up yesterday night. He was still in the same t-shirt and trousers, although the button-up shirt he was wearing before was slung over the back of the chair.

"Draco," said Bill, when Draco failed to look up from the notebook. He was writing swiftly as he glanced between two open books and then a bottle with a small amount of clear liquid in it. The liquid was bubbling slightly.

"Hmm?" asked Draco, not paying attention to him at all.

"Breakfast is ready. Did you even get any sleep last night?"

"I wasn't tired," said Draco, now picking up the bottle with his free hand and raising it to the light. He frowned and made a note in the pages.

Bill was about to start a lecture when he noticed something on Draco's bare arm. He stepped further into the room, reaching out and halting Draco's writing with a hand on the boy's shoulder. Draco glanced over, brows knit, but Bill was already pulling Draco's arm up so he could look at the scar.

He knew when Draco finally realized his intentions because he could feel Draco stiffen and try to pull away, but he didn't let go.

Draco's arm was still sporting a few bruises where his blood vessels hadn't completely healed, and the marks were dark against the pale skin. The scar itself was a still-red welt, running jaggedly for several inches. It was strikingly serpentine, and then Bill turned Draco's arm over to see the identical wound on the other side.

He looked up at Draco, but the grey eyes were downcast, studiously examining the table.

"Does it hurt still?" he asked.

"It's fine."

"You know, the trouble with saying that all the time is that I no longer believe you."

The grey eyes slid up to meet his gaze. "Only when I strain my arm or put too much pressure on it."

"I had no idea it was this bad," said Bill. "I didn't think it was this long, because the blade…," he trailed off, realizing the truth. The blade wasn't that wide; Voldemort had speared Draco's arm and then pulled his hand, causing the long gash.

"Yeah," said Draco softly.

It was that soft tone that had Bill pause. The scar was a sore point with Draco, but there was more too it than that, something else was disturbing him. He knew that Draco wouldn't reveal anything further, so he would have to dig deeper.

"It looks like a snake," he said, trying to start a conversation, but Draco visibly flinched at the word 'snake'.

Bill paused, knowing that he had just hit the reason for Draco's discomfort, but not knowing why. Why would a snake-?

"Ah," he said, answering his own question.

He let Draco pull his arm away, and then the white-blond deliberately picked up his quill again.

"It's entirely different from a Dark Mark," said Bill.

Draco didn't look over.

"Draco, the Death Eaters sign up for their jobs; they want the mark. This is Voldemort's sick way of punishing you for not taking it."

"It's in the same place as a Dark Mark," said Draco. "I'll still be wearing long sleeves for the rest of my life with the rest of the Death Eaters."

"Why?"

Draco looked at him with an incredulous expression.

"It's nothing to be ashamed of," said Bill.

"I'd rather not spend the rest of my life having people stare at my arm," said Draco.

"Harry seems to cope with the stares."

"He's the sodding Boy-Who-Lived."

"And you're the son of Lucius Malfoy who denounced Voldemort to his face. There are going to be stares even without the scar."

"It's ugly," said Draco.

Bill frowned. Since when was Draco concerned with looks? His confusion must have shown because Draco sighed.

"I know that people think I'm attractive in a…fey sort of way, but I've never drawn attention to my looks on a day to day basis. Sometimes I do, when I need to get noticed or I need to make a point, but it's not as if I don't care how I look. I like being clean and neat and dressed well. This," he said, gesturing at his arm, "is crude and ugly."

Bill was silent, turning Draco's words over in his head. It was true. He had never seen Draco dress to draw attention, purposely looking handsome. On the occasion he was wearing finer robes, it was only to annunciate the quality of the robes, and how expensive they had been, but still, he had always dressed well. His sense of style was so developed, and he wore high fashion so casually, it was almost as if he was accidentally dressed so well.

"Well, it is winter now," said Bill, "so you will be wearing long sleeves when you go out, and when you are at fancy dinner parties and whatever it is you rich people do, you will be wearing a jacket so people won't be able to see. I think the rest of it is just trying to accustom yourself to the scar. Once you accept it, people will see that, and they won't keep making such a big fuss about it."

"And how do I get used to it?" asked Draco.

Bill crossed over to the discarded oxford and picked it up. "Don't wear this to breakfast."

Draco raised an eyebrow, but then gave a short nod. Bill pulled out his wand and banished the shirt to Draco's room. Draco turned back to his book.

"Breakfast is now," said Bill.

"I'm in the middle of this," said Draco.

"Two minutes," said Bill. "Then come in, alright?"

"Yeah," said Draco.

Bill walked back to the dining room where his mother had finished bringing out the food.

"Where is he?" she asked.

"He'll be in," said Bill sitting down. He poured himself a mug of coffee and then passed platters around the table, filling his own plate with grilled tomatoes, eggs, and toast. Four minutes later he sighed and pushed back his chair.

Draco was still in the study, still looking at whatever liquid was in the bottle and consulting the book.

"Draco, breakfast," he said.

"Yeah," said Draco, making no move to put down the book.

"Now," said Bill.

"Two minutes," said Draco.

"I gave you two minutes four minutes ago."

"I know, but this is rather important."

"One minute," said Bill.

Draco nodded.

"And I mean one, Draco. One."

"Yes," said Draco.

Bill rolled his eyes and went back to his breakfast. Three minutes later he sighed and started to get up while the rest of the table snickered at him.

"Do you want me to get him?" asked Ginny.

Bill paused. "Think you'll have better luck?"

She smiled. "I just might."

I know, I don't deserve reviews for making you all wait and causing half of you to assume that something terrible (like a freak meteor landing on my house) happened. But, just because I don't deserve it, doesn't mean you won't give me one, right? Right? (inserting puppy dog eyes and a trembling lower lip).

Anyway (cough), yes, I will be updating Tuesday, this Tuesday. As long as a freak meteor doesn't land on my house. Cheers!





5. Breakfast and Boy Talk

Disclaimer: Nope!

Author's note: So, here it is, and I'm just an hour late. I had a bit of trouble writing this chapter, and I didn't find my must until two hours ago, so apologies if there is a greater abundance of typos, I only looked over it once before posting. And, I won't be able to reply to reviews this time, because I have to get this up to make the deadline, but thank you.

Another note, I may be late posting next week because I'll be moving back to college, but if so, I'll try my hardest to put it up the following day.

One more, a reviewer asked if the other stories were necessary to understand this one, and yeah, there are some definite occurrences that need to be read. However, if you like this story, the other ones should be good reading as well. If that looks a little daunting, drop me your email and I can leave a synopsis, but I hope you check the story out.

That being said, THANK YOU to all my reviewers and I'm so sorry I won't be replying, but this is late, and college packing is calling. Thanks again, and enjoy!

Draco gently swirled the clear liquid in the glass. It didn't make sense.

He had taken a very small shaving from the knife blade, ground it into a fine powder, and then sprinkled it in a small amount of water and a weak truth serum. If there were dark curses on the blade, the water would have turned red. He kept waiting for the water to change, because there was no way the knife could turn invisible without the use of dark magic. All of the signs were there: it had only produced the invisibility after being covered in Draco's blood, it was protected by an insanely strong amount of wards, and its décor was primarily serpentine. If this wasn't a knife belonging to a dark wizard, than Salazaar was a Gryffindor.

Still, that didn't negate the fact that the water was not turning red, which mean the wards and spells on the blade were not dark ones.

He frowned, and flipped through the book again. Maybe he was just missing something.

Sometimes he got absorbed in his work. When this happened, he could know when someone entered the room, and he could answer questions and hold a stilted conversation, but usually only with the people he felt comfortable around. Sometimes he really got absorbed in his work, and wasn't even aware of what was happening around him. That was why he jumped when the book he was reading was slammed shut.

He jerked up to see Ginny Weasley smiling at him.

"Interesting read?" she asked.

Draco frowned. "I was in a particularly engaging section, yes."

"Then you won't mind coming back to it after breakfast."

"I'm in the middle of an analysis," said Draco, reaching for the book, intending on flipping it open again, but Ginny snatched the book and pulled it away.

"It's time for breakfast," she said.

"I'm aware of that," said Draco.

"Then why aren't you eating?"

"Because I'm rather busy at the moment."

"Not anymore you're not," said Ginny. "Come on. The book will still be here when you come back."

"Weasley, just give me the book," said Draco.

"Say my name," said Ginny.

"Ginevra, give me the book."

Ginny scowled at the use of her full name; Draco smirked and held out his hand, his right hand. He was trying to use his left, with the scar clearly visible, as little as possible.

"Umm, no," said Ginny.

Draco started forward and she skipped backwards.

"Weasley," Draco started, but she raised her eyebrows. "Ginny," he amended.

"Yes, Draco?" she asked, giving him a sickeningly innocent smile.

"Can I have my book back?"

"Are you going to come to breakfast?"

"Fine. Yes."

"Good, then you can have it." And she promptly left the room, taking the book with her.

"Weasley!" Draco snapped, following her.

"This is just insurance," she called back.

Draco sighed, but entered the dining room. Ginny had retaken her seat, his book still in her lap and Draco pointedly ignored her. He pulled out the chair next to Harry, ignoring Bill as well. He had, no doubt, sent his little sister to pull him away from his study when was in the middle of an experiment. He disregarded the fact that the knife really could wait, and that he had already told Bill he would be in for breakfast. Twice.

"Go ahead and sulk all you want Draco," said Bill.

"I'm not sulking," said Draco, accepting the bowl of eggs from Harry and spooning some on his plate.

"I don't know, George," said Fred. "I think he's sulking."

"He looks like he's sulking," George agreed.

"Why do you suppose ickle Malfoy is upset?"

"Did the little ferret not sleep well?"

Draco turned his glare on them and then reached out to take the plate of toast Bill was handing his way. The eldest Weasley was not at all put off by his irritability; sometimes Bill was so nice it was a little aggravating.

"Shit, Draco, what happened to your arm?" asked Harry suddenly, catching sight of the scar.

Draco took a piece of toast and then passed the platter along as if he wasn't off put by the question. He gave a slight shrug.

"A knife," he said, and then took the serving bowl of grilled tomatoes Bill held out. He scooped a few onto his plate and tried to pass it on to Harry, but the Boy-Who-Lived was staring at the scar.

"What about a knife?" asked Hermione, taking the tomatoes as her boyfriend wasn't paying attention to Draco's attempts to pass them on. She saw the mark on Draco's arm. "A knife did that?" she asked in disbelief.

Her voice carried; so did the word 'knife'. Heads turned in her direction, following her gaze to Draco's arm.

"What happened?" Hermione continued.

Draco glanced to Bill, sending him a dark look, but then turning back to Hermione.

"The Dark Lord ran a knife through my arm," he said. "Would you pass the coffee?"

A moment of silence. Ron gave Draco a sympathetic grimace; Kingsley cleared his throat. Harry broke out of his shock and passed the coffee for Hermione.

"Here you are," he told Draco.

Draco gave him a short 'Thanks' and then Harry started a conversation with Ron, rather deliberately. He obviously understood what it was like to be gawked at, but curiosity was apparently a Gryffindor characteristic.

"Whoa, wait just a minute," said Fred.

"Hold up there," said George. "Malfoy here got his arm skewered-,"

"And no one is in the least bit curious?" Fred finished.

"Boys," Mr. Weasley started, but Fred and George spoke over him.

"When did Voldemort stab you?"

"And why didn't you tell us?"

"Yeah, mate, because that's pretty wicked."

"It's not a Potter, but definitely up there."

"Oi," said Ron, getting their attention. He flushed slightly when they looked his way. "It wasn't exactly cool, just so you know."

"How would you-?" Fred and George started, but Hermione figured it out.

"You were there?" she asked.

"Well, we were kidnapped together," said Ron, shifting a bit in his chair and glancing to Draco. Draco was startled that Ron was defending him, but he appreciated it.

"What happened?" asked Hermione.

Draco really didn't want to answer that, but judging by the 'we're trying not to look too interested, but we want to know exactly what happened because we are sickly curious' looks he was receiving from most of the table, it would be quicker just to get it over with now. And, as much as he hated to admit it, Bill was right. If he acted as if he was okay with it, as if it didn't bother him that much, they would adopt the same attitude.

He held up his arm. "Apparently the Dark Lord was a little angry I wouldn't take his mark, so he gave me one anyway."

"And that's on both sides?"

"The knife went through my arm, yes," Draco confirmed, showing her, and consequently the rest of the table, that the mark was identical on the other side.

"That's sick," said Hermione.

Draco shrugged and then poured himself a mug of coffee. There was another moment of awkward silence and then Kingsley spoke up.

"If you're not too busy later this morning, Draco, I'm meeting Dumbledore at the Ministry at eleven to help analyze the damage, if you still want to come, that is."

"Of course," said Draco quickly. Like he would pass up that opportunity?

"Have anymore thoughts on the storm?"

He did, quite a collection in fact, but no one else at the table was speaking, they were all listening in, and Draco found the attention to be disconcerting.

"A few," he said, avoiding the gazes and looking down at his plate. Suddenly it was like dining in the Malfoy home, where the tension was stifling and the food seemed heavier, weighted, sticking to his throat as he swallowed. He gulped at his coffee.

"Charlie, Ron," said Bill. "Later today I'm heading home to bring the nursery set-up back here, could I have some help sending things through the Floo?"

And just like that, the attention shifted and Draco turned to Bill as well, thankful and surprised. Bill and Fleur would be staying at the Headquarters? His question was echoed by half the Weasleys.

"You're moving in?"

"Can't get enough of us?"

"When did you decide this?"

"How long are you staying?"

Bill took a sip of his own coffee before answering.

"Well, Christmas is coming up in a few weeks, so instead of going back home at the end of the week, only to return for another week during the holiday, Fleur and I figured it would just be easier to stay here. Besides, this way there will be plenty of willing babysitters for Lukas so Fleur and I can get some sleep when we need it."

He didn't say anything about staying to look out for Draco, but Bill looked over in his direction, and Draco could read it in his eyes. He gave a nod of thanks; he didn't think he could cope with a houseful of Weasleys by himself.

"Well, we'd love to stay and chat," said George.

"And we really mean that," said Fred.

"But Forge and I have to head out to the shop."

"Ah, the joys of bratty children at holiday time. I'd feel bad for the parents-,"

"But it just means more profit for us."

"Besides," said Fred, "it's the parents' fault their children are prats anyway."

"Bill," said George, "when we get back, we wish to see our nephew."

The both grinned and levitated their plates into the kitchen before Apparating away.

"Well, I don't have work," said Ron. "Can I see him now?"

"In a few minutes," said Bill. "I want to finish my breakfast and make sure Fleur's alright with visitors."

Charlie stood as well, having finished, and while most of the occupants of the Order Headquarters were still eating, Draco thought he could probably make an exit. He skidded back his chair, but he was arrested by a sharp voice.

"Just what do you think you are doing, young man?"

Draco froze and turned to see Mrs. Weasley looking quite disapproving. He blinked.

"I was going back to my study?" he said, but the statement came out sounding more like a question, something which irked him.

"Not until you finish your breakfast. You haven't eaten enough to keep a bird alive."

"I should hope not," said Draco, making no move to pick up his fork. "Birds eat their body weight daily."

The look on Mrs. Weasley's face changed from disapproving into a stern frown. She wasn't the least bit menacing, at least that's what Draco tried telling himself, but he found himself scooting his chair back towards the table and his hand reached for his fork. He chewed a piece of egg and then swallowed it with a sip of coffee, trying his best not to choke. He was never able to eat when ordered and he looked to Bill, hoping the new father could get him off.

Bill read the desperation in his eyes, but instead of excusing him, he turned to Kingsley.

"Any word on the damage count at the Ministry yet?"

"Well, the buildings are still standing," the Auror began, "but that's just because it is underground. Most of the damage came from the inside with instruments exploding from the magical interference."

"But how much damage could that really cause?" asked Hermione.

Bill jerked his head at Draco's plate and Draco sighed but began to eat as Shacklebolt elaborated. He knew that Bill was just helping distract him, but it really did help.

"Quite a bit, actually. All of the elevators are demolished because the pulley charms on them snapped and they dropped to the lobby floor and smashed through a good deal of the walls there. The windows with the enchanted scenery burst, sending shrapnel into the walls. The lights exploded as well and it will take a while to get the magicians in to set that up again."

"Wait," said Harry, looking up at that. "Magicians?"

"Not the card trick kind," Hermione explained. "Magicians in the wizarding world are like electricians. They install the torches that light up when someone walks past, or in the Ministry's case, the glowing crystal balls, or the overhead lamps."

"Oh," said Harry.

"And all of the magically-vertical cubical walls were thrown half-way across the room, taking out most of the desks," Kingsley continued.

"I knew the Ministry would regret not spending the extra money to set them up manually," said Mr. Weasley, shaking his head.

"And once you get past the structural damage, there are the little pieces that will make it a pain to clean. All of the notepads for the airplane memos were excited, and the place is swimming in paper airplanes, at least that's when my contact says. Also the re-filling inkpots blew up, sending ink every where and some of that is indelible. And, on top of that, the fountain statue is wrecked again."

Ron, Harry, and Hermione laughed at that. Draco remembered their fight in the Ministry at the end of fifth year that led to the destruction of the fountain, which really was a blatant piece of wizard superiority propaganda. He drank the rest of his coffee and stood. His plate was empty, except for a half piece of cold toast, and he was feeling full. This time no one stopped him as he cleared his plate and then walked upstairs, deciding on a shower before going back to his study.

He grabbed a set of clothes out of his trunk before walking to the bathroom, and decided that he really did need to unpack. Anti-wrinkle charms were simple, but rather lengthy.

He took the two minutes that unpacking required after his shower and that simple act relaxed him just as much as the hot water. It was more than a temporary hotel room now, but he wasn't quite ready to call it anything more just yet. He headed down into his back room and pulled up short.

Ginny Weasley was in his study, bending over the table and poking at his knife.

"What are you doing?" he asked.

She looked up and didn't even have the decency to look abashed. She held up his book.

"Returning this," she said. "You have a lot of stuff here." She crossed over to the walls and looked over the runes.

Draco glared, but stepped into the room, checking over the table to make sure she hadn't messed anything up.

"Don't you have anything else to do?" he asked pointedly.

"Yeah, I suppose," she said, giving the runes a last look and then turning to him with a smile. "So Bill made you godfather, huh?"

"Yeah," he said, the topic change throwing him slightly.

"I think that's cool," she said. "And you were as well, yesterday, with the whole… birthing thing."

She was obviously getting somewhere with this and Draco merely waited, watching her closely as her cheeks flushed.

"I want to apologize for snapping at you during the storm," she said. "I get a little freaked out, as you noticed."

He shrugged a shoulder. "Everyone has a Boggart," he said.

She shrugged as well, scuffing her foot on the floor and studying the objects on the table again.

"Is a childhood thing?" he asked, just to break the silence. He had been planning on telling her to get out, but he was curious.

"Not really," she said. "Just bad memories."

She walked closer to the table and Draco frowned. She had told him enough to answer his question, but not enough to reveal anything more. It was apparent by her tone of voice that the conversation had ended, and asking another question would be blatantly obtrusive, not to mention it would also show he was intrigued. It was a Slytherin answer; his curiosity doubled.

She picked up the knife again, and then looked over to Draco, her eyebrows raised.

"This isn't the knife that was stuck through your arm, was it?"

"It is," said Draco.

"That's a little…atypical, isn't it? Keeping the knife that Voldemort marked you with?"

"It helped me get out."

"And what's this?" she asked, now picking up the glass of water and peering through it.

"I'm testing for dark curses on the knife," said Draco, wondering if she knew how obnoxious she was being.

"And this means yes?"

"It means no," said Draco shortly.

"You sound upset. Did you want dark curses on the knife?"

"I'm not upset, and no, I don't want dark curses on the knife, I just know there are and I have not yet ascertained the reason to why the test isn't showing that."

"Or maybe there just aren't any dark curses on the knife."

"There has to be."

"Why does there have to be dark curses on the knife?"

Draco sighed. "Look, Weasley-,"

"Ginny," she corrected him.

"Ginny," he amended. "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I would actually like to get back to working."

"You mean I'm bothering you."

"Yes," he said.

She considered that for a moment and then smiled. "Alright, I'll get out of your hair on one condition."

"I shouldn't have to agree to a condition to get you to leave," said Draco.

She shrugged. "I don't see why it's such a big deal to explain a knife to me."

"Fine, what is it?"

"No more calling me Weasley. It's Ginny, and no cute plays on the name either, like Gin-gin, Ginna, or Gineve, and it is most definitely not Ginevra, got it?"

"Yes," said Draco. "Ginny."

"Good," she said. She gave him a parting smile and left. Draco rolled his eyes and picked up the book she left on the table.

By eleven, he was still no further in determining why the dark curses on the knife were avoiding the water test, so he started to prepare a more thorough investigation. He put it on hold when Kingsley knocked on the door and followed the Auror into the living room.

"We're Flooing straight in, but there's only one operational fireplace, so there may be a bit of a wait. You aren't claustrophobic, are you?"

Draco shook his head and took the pinch of Floo. He followed the black Auror through the fireplace and sure enough, instead of appearing directly on the other side, he could feel the cramped, warm brick. From the heat he could determine that he was about half-way up the 'chimney', but he was descending at a steady clip which meant people were stepping out of the way in a timely fashion.

He stepped out into the atrium of the Ministry of Magic and instantly began surveying the damage. The entrances for the elevators were all blown out, but most of that debris was being swept up by construction teams. The fountain was roped off, and from the breaches in the wall, and by the slight water damage on the floor, it appeared that the lobby had been flooded as well. A few craters had been blown into the walls where magical torches used to stand and the fireplaces were in the process of being reconnected.

"Draco, over here."

Draco turned and caught sight of Dumbledore and Kingsley standing a bit away from the Floo and he walked over to join them, still cataloguing the damages. A few of the magical portraits seemed to be melted onto the walls.

Dumbledore twinkled down on him. "Getting any ideas on the storm?"

"A few," said Draco. "I'm going to have to see the other rooms though and compare the damage."

"We can do that," said Dumbledore. "Minister Fudge has called me in to assist in any way possible and I have clearance into the entire ministry, though I'm afraid we'll have to take the stairs. This way."

Draco nodded and followed the Headmaster.

Ginny scrunched her face up in the mirror. Sometimes she detested her freckles. They were so childish, so 'country bumpkin' like, but there was no way she would ever stoop to concealing them. First of all, finding a good concealer was always a pain. Her skin wasn't white, but she did have a red-head's complexion and so the tinted cover-up never matched well enough. She could use an invisible potion to vanish her freckles, but that either dried her skin out, or made her break out.

Secondly, the ones that worked were rather expensive and while she could afford them, that would mean skimping on her wardrobe and she was sick of buying the cheapest outfits available.

Thirdly, if she did start using a cover-up to hide her freckles, everyone would know. The Weasleys' were all red-haired and freckled, just like all Malfoy's were pale and blond. If she showed up to school with smooth skin, people would wonder why she was trying so hard, and who she was trying to impress.

Fourthly, there were days when she just rolled out of bed and ran to class just managing to throw on her uniform. She wouldn't want to have freckles one day, and be clear the would be something she would have to keep up with, and frankly, she couldn't be that high maintenance all the time.

She sighed and comforted herself by brushing out her hair which was one hundred percent naturally red. Being a Weasley meant that she didn't have to hear questions about the authenticity of her color and if 'the curtains matched the covers', which was more than just a relief. And as far as Ginny was concerned, she had the best hair of the Weasley children, well, Bill's hair was nice, and when he didn't dry it with a charm, he could get perfect curls. The ends of Ginny's hair curled, giving her hair amazing movement and body, but if she wanted curls, she would have to use a serum and scrunch her hair.

She set the brush down and then ran her hand through her hair, studying her reflection once more. Freckles were just so…so unrefined and inelegant. She made a face at herself and left the bathroom, walking down the hall to Hermione's room and taking her place back on the bed.

"Took you long enough," said Hermione. "What about this one?" Hermione turned the magazine to Ginny.

Ginny looked at the featured witch. "I like her shirt," she said.

"But the haircut?"

Ginny looked up. "Mione, your hair is so thick, that if you did want to chop it above your shoulders, you would have an afro."

Hermione sighed. "I know, I'm just so sick of…of this." She tugged helplessly at a strand of curl. While Hermione had learned to control the frizz of her hair, there just wasn't anyway around the fact that she had very thick, very curly hair that was nearly unmanageable.

"It never bothered you before," said Ginny. "Why now?"

"I don't know," said Hermione, flopping back onto her pillows. "I guess I've just hit the point where I need a change, desperately."

Ginny wasn't exactly buying her story. While she understood where Hermione was coming from – in her third year she had begun to grow her hair out from an above shoulder length which left it without a style and limp – Hermione was more than just looking at different hairstyles. She was looking at attractive, sexy witches with gold-blonde hair falling in soft waves down their back or cut in face-framing layers. The witches in the pictures were simpering and primping, tossing their heads every now and then, shaking their hair only to have it fall back in perfect place.

"You aren't planning on dying your hair, are you?" asked Ginny casually.

"What? Oh, no," said Hermione. Brief pause. "Do you think I should?"

Ginny shut the magazine and tossed it to the floor where it joined the others. "Hermione, is there something you want to tell me?"

Hermione sighed, but then sat up, facing Ginny and tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

"You think that Harry is good-looking, right?" she asked.

"Yes," said Ginny, wondering where this was going.

"How good-looking would you say?"

Ginny hesitated for a second. This was Harry she was talking about. The boy who she had a crush on for the first five years of school, but then realized the truth, that somehow he wasn't enough, and now he was dating her best girl friend, and was best friends with her brother. While she was perfectly fine admitting that she thought Harry was extremely attractive, she wanted to do it in a way that wouldn't make Hermione think she still liked him.

"It's alright," said Hermione, correctly reading her pause. "I know you don't like him like that anymore."

Ginny laughed. "Oh good, because I couldn't really think of a way to say that 'your boyfriend is bloody hot' in a purely plutonic sense. Harry is very good-looking, and he has a great body. He could do with losing the glasses, but it's pretty easy to look past them. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give him an eight point five."

"Really?" asked Hermione, looking somewhat disappointed at that.

"Not high enough?" asked Ginny.

"No," said Hermione, "well, I'd give him a nine, but…but where am I on the scale?"

Ginny's eyebrows shot up on their own accord. "You don't think you're hot enough for him?" she asked.

"No," said Hermione quickly. "I mean, well, I know that there is more to life than looks and that people deserve to be rated by their personality and heart but…,"

"But," Ginny prodded.

"Lavender said something to Pavarti about how she was surprised that Harry was dating me because he could have any girl in school."

"Well then Lavender's a bitch," said Ginny, "just like those witches in that fashion magazine. Hermione, Harry is with you because…because you're just perfect together. You two, and I'm going to sound totally cliché and cheesy here, complete each other. He's the sporty one, and you like books. He can be laid-back, and you take charge. He could use a little help in the study arena on occasion, and you don't need help at all. It's like a movie romance."

"But if we have nothing in common, how long are we going to last?"

"You're a lot a like in the important areas," said Ginny quickly, trying to comfort her best friend. "You both grew up in Muggle homes, so you both love magic that much more. You are two of the kindest people I have ever met, and I really mean that. You both have these amazing ideals about how the world should work, and instead of giving up when you see it isn't so, you try to change it. You have so much in common."

"You think so?" asked Hermione.

"Definitely," said Ginny. "Besides, one other thing you have in common, is that you both love each other, and when you look at him, and when he looks at you, both of you smile like you can't help it. So sod Lavender Brown; she's a skank anyway."

"Ginny!" said Hermione in shock.

Ginny shrugged. "Well, she is. She'll bang anything with a broomstick."

Hermione stifled a laugh. "Does your mother know you talk like that?"

"No," said Ginny. "Let's keep it that way too. Merlin knows what my brothers would do."

"They would want to know exactly where you learned such language and then proceed to beat said source to the ground."

"Most likely," Ginny agreed.

Hermione lay back down on the pillows. "Alright, so I'm forgetting whatever Lavender Brown said, but I am rather tired of this mass of curls on my head. What should I do?"

"Have you ever tried a straightening serum?" asked Ginny.

"I've tried a few straightening charms."

"Those never work well, in fact, all beauty charms never last long. You actually have to buy a product, but I do have some."

"You straighten your hair?" asked Hermione.

"Only when it's humid because my hair can get as frizzy as yours in second year."

"Ouch," said Hermione.

Ginny laughed. "Come on. We'll give you a make over."

She dragged the older girl to the bathroom and then shut the door.

"Stick your head under the bath faucet. With your hair, I think it's going to need to be soaking wet for this to work."

Hermione obligingly wet her hair as Ginny pulled out the straightening serum from Ravenlocks Hair Boutique and a bottle of conditioning, anti-frizz lotion.

"Merlin, your hair is long," said Ginny when Hermione's hair was drenched. "Without the curl you've got another five inches at least."

"What should I do?" asked Hermione.

"You just sit and let me play hairdresser," said Ginny. "I'm sister deprived."

"You and me both," said Hermione. "Let me tell you, only child isn't all that fun."

Ginny began combing through Hermione's hair with a wide-tooth comb.

"You know what?" Ginny asked.

"What?" asked Hermione.

"I think I would give you an eight on the hot scale," said Ginny. "I mean that in a total sisterly way."

"Really?" asked Hermione.

"Oh yeah, easily," said Ginny. "You've got amazing skin and it's on the tan side."

"I don't help it any," said Hermione. "I don't go outside unless I have to."

"You should," said Ginny. "Whenever I go out, my freckles multiply."

"You don't like your freckles?" asked Hermione.

Ginny made a face and then picked up the bottle of serum and squirted a good amount into her hand. She added some of the conditioning cream and rubbed her hands together.

"Most definitely not," she said, working the hair care products through Hermione's thick locks.

"I think they're cute."

"I'm sick of cute though," said Ginny. "I would like to look older, a bit sophisticated."

"Sophisticated, huh?" asked Hermione. "Who do you want to look sophisticated for?"

Her tone was teasing, but Ginny still flushed. Hermione, like any girl, could smell a love interest even in the middle of a Quidditch match.

"Who?" she asked. "Who is it?"

"It's no one," said Ginny, but she was still blushing furiously.

"It is not no one. Come on, Ginny, tell me. I told you when I liked Harry."

"Only because you were afraid I still liked him and would be broken-hearted if you started dating."

"But I still told you," said Hermione. "Come on, I won't tell, promise."

"I don't know," said Ginny. "It's kinda…well, there is no hope, and I don't even know if I like him. It could just be an infatuation." She cast a gradual drying charm on Hermione's hair.

"Oh, please," said Hermione. "If you tell me, I could tell you if there was hope."

"It's embarrassing," said Ginny.

"Do you think telling you about Harry was easy?"

Ginny sighed. "Fine, but you can't tell anyone, swear?"

"Swear," said Hermione.

Ginny leaned back on the wall, but she couldn't look Hermione in the eyes. "It's Draco," she said quickly, preparing for the discouragements to follow. Instead, Hermione was silent. Ginny looked up to see the older girl studying her thoughtfully.

"What?" she asked.

"Well, I can see why," said Hermione. "He is gorgeous. A definite ten."

"Nine," said Ginny, shaking her head. "Maybe a nine point five. He's a little too pale and a little skinny and angular."

"Picky," said Hermione.

Ginny shrugged.

"But still," said Hermione, "on the occasions he has talked to you, he hasn't walked all over you. You can stand your ground around him, which is a plus."

"But he is still the Slytherin Ice Prince and sex god," said Ginny. "Not the kind of guy I usually go for."

"The guys you have gone for have been, well, you seem to get bored with them," said Hermione. "How many dates have you been on this past year?"

"I can't help it," said Ginny. "They're just so safe and…flat. There's no excitement."

"Well it explains why you're crushing on Draco Malfoy. You can't get more dangerous than him."

"I don't think he even notices me though."

"Maybe you just have to make him."

"How? It's not like I can actually flirt with him, not with my parents around, and I have been attempting to interact with him. He's just…,"

"First of all, is it even possible to flirt with Draco? Secondly, you are living in the same house as him. I'm thinking that calls for some tank tops? Coming into breakfast with your hair still wet from the shower? He's a teenage boy and you are the only single, attractive girl in this whole house. It shouldn't be too hard."

Ginny considered that. "Alright," she said. "But you have to help."

"I love playing matchmaker," said Hermione.

"But no telling anyone," said Ginny.

"My lips are sealed."

"Good. I think your hair is dry too. Look in the mirror and tell me what you think."

Hermione stepped in front of the mirror, staring at the sight of her face framed by perfectly smooth, straight hair. Granted, her hair was fuller than the current fashion of straight hair demanded, but the body looked better on her. She squealed and then threw her arms around Ginny.

"I love it!" she cried.

"An eight point five with that hair," said Ginny, fixing a few of the strands. "Let's go show that boyfriend of yours."

Harry and Ron were immersed in a game of wizard's chess, Charlie coaching Harry in a few spots. Hermione perched on the edge of Harry's chair, and the boy-hero slung an arm around her waist.

"Hey babe," he said, smiling up at her.

Ron captured his knight and Harry looked back down at the board, sighing with frustration.

Ginny caught Hermione's gaze and they both roller their eyes. Four moves later and the game was over, Ron the victor. Harry just shook his head and reached up to grab a consolation kiss from Hermione. He pulled back, tilted his head to the side, and smiled.

"You straightened your hair," he said, reaching up to play with a piece.

"Do you like it?" asked Hermione.

"Very pretty, but I like it curly too. I like this more." And he leaned in for another kiss.

Ginny smiled.

So, I'm thinking in the next chapter there will be a small Lucius encounter AND some really bad news for the Order, but it's not someone dying. Again, I will try very hard to get an update next Tuesday, but with heading down to college, I might be a day late. Please leave one!





6. Discovery of a Decoy

Disclaimer: Nope, not mine.

Author's note: I'm going to get this up with two minutes to spare, literally. Going back to college was a bit more work than I thought and I've loads of homework already and a test next week. Crazy, and because of that, I am, once again, unable to reply to reviews. Very sorry about that, but I will begin again next week with the next update. Also apologies for typos as I didn't proofread all that muchly. Thanks to my reviewers, love y'all!

Draco stepped into the main office area for the regulation of magical animals and gazed about the room. It was much like the other floors he had already visited. Cubicle dividers were strewn across the floor, some lying on top of desks and others crashed into the water coolers or filing cabinets. Papers were scattered among the debris and black stains marked where inkpots had shattered. The walls were dented in some areas and the ceiling was cracked. The room was lit by a spread of portable, floating crystal glow balls that were brought in by the emergency magicians.

"A complete mess," said Kingsley behind him. "Just like the rest of the floors. I hope this tells you something."

"If it was just like the other floors, I would still be trying to decide if they used a weather-manipulating spell along with a magical interference charm or if the weather spell was incased in a dark magic field."

"And?" asked Kingsley.

"Well I don't know just yet," said Draco. "I'm going to have to talk to whoever was in charge of warding this floor."

"I can check the report," said Kingsley, "but I don't see the difference."

"The filing cabinet, right there," said Draco. "It's still shut; the locking spell on it held. All of the desk drawers are closed as well. In fact, the way this debris is scattered, it looks as if there was one or two gusts of wind, but then whoever was called in to ward this room used a different type of shield, preventing further damage. I need to know what that spell was."

Kingsley raised his eyebrows. "I'll go find out."

The Auror left and Draco stepped further into the room, scrutinizing the scene, but he was still at a loss. This type of damage could have been caused by a few curses, and all of them were difficult to control. Whoever the Dark Lord had found to create this type of storm was good, very good, and that did not bode well at all for the Order.

"What are you thinking?" asked Dumbledore behind him.

Draco didn't turn around. "I could ask you the same question, or are you just testing me?"

"Not testing," said Dumbledore. "I have several theories, yes, but I have not had the experience in dark magic as you have. You must have narrowed down the ingredient list for such a storm."

"Not completely," said Draco. He nudged aside a few papers with his foot and stared at an ink spot on the carpet. There were no pieces of glass accompanying the dried ink; the pots were charmed to dissolve should they ever shatter. The glass had remained from the bits of bottle on the other floors as the magical storm had interfered with the glass charms, but not on this floor. Draco really wanted to know what shield charm the warder had used.

Behind him the door opened and a woman's voice echoed, coming clearer as she stepped out of the stairwell into the room.

"I already gave the Auror's my report, and I really don't think that this is necessary. I just want to go home; I've been here since six in the morning filing out papers and signing forms, and frankly, I'm sick of it."

Draco turned.

The woman was beautiful. She was of average height but she had a good figure. Her hair was dark and smooth and she flipped it over her shoulder as she spoke. She wore make-up, red lips and dark eyes, and a pin-stripe short skirt and jacket combination. Her face was irritated.

"This is a private investigation," said Dumbledore, smiling at the woman and she softened.

"Professor Dumbledore," she said, stepping over a piece of chair to shake the older man's hand, which was quite a feat in her heels. "It has been awhile."

"Five years now since you graduated, isn't it?" he asked.

"It is indeed. I didn't realize that you were investigating the storm." There was a question in that statement.

"Yes, Minister Fudge gave me a call and asked for assistance. I, in turn, elicited this young man's help and he has a few questions for you."

Dumbledore turned to Draco and the woman turned as well, her expression darkening as she recognized him.

"Professor, you do realize that is a Malfoy, right?" she asked, disdain evident in her voice.

"Draco is no longer affiliated with his father," said Dumbledore lightly. "Draco, this is Coriander Thompson."

"Draco, is it?" asked Coriander.

Draco knew what type of girl she was. She was one of those women that, should she ever be at a bar, she wouldn't ever have to pay for a drink, and she was smart, opinionated. It was the type of girl that he went for, and he knew exactly how to get her. He put on an expression of forced interest and held out his hand, not staring at the bit of cleavage she showed and looked her straight in the eye.

"Draco Malfoy," he said. And he didn't pull his hand back, not even when she pointedly ignored him, and when the silence became uncomfortable, and when Kingsley and Dumbledore were both looking at her, wondering why she wouldn't shake his hand, she finally blushed.

But it wouldn't do to leave her uncomfortable, to be the fault of this etiquette breach. He looked down on his hand and gave an embarrassed chuckle.

"Oh, sorry," he said. "You're right." He wiped his hand on his trouser leg and held out his left instead. "I was poking about a bit, but I swear this one is clean."

And she shook his head hesitantly, wondering if he really hadn't noticed her rudeness, wondering if he had just saved her face in front of Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts and Kingsley Shacklebolt, one of the top three Aurors in all of England for the fifth year in a row. And now, she owed him something.

"Professor Dumbledore said that you had a few questions," she said. "I wasn't aware that you held a consulting position."

The slight condescension in her voice meant that he hadn't won this battle by far. Coriander Thompson was goal-oriented; she had to be if she was called in to ward the Ministry when she had only graduated five years ago. He remembered her, of course; their schooling had overlapped by two years. She was a Ravenclaw and both her parents were Muggle-born. Ravenclaws were attracted to status and intellect. He had both, and he was just as good looking as she.

"I don't," he said, "but the Professor thought I would be helpful when it came to this."

There, he was giving his reference. Dumbledore had asked him specifically and she would realize that meant he was quite intelligent. He spoke again, just to drive his point home, incorporating a few Muggle phrases.

"There are a few theories I'm chasing on the storm, but it's proving difficult as we've never seen anything of this magnitude before. The content of the storm is nothing sort of genius, and the time-dilation field actually reversed the storm. Not calling it back in time, but causing the molecules to move backwards, like the storm was on 'rewind' but playing in real time. Of course, it would take some rather powerful spells to have such an effect and -," he cut himself off. "I'm sorry. I was rambling there; I got a bit caught up."

He gave her a small smile, brushed some of his hair back from his forehead, and, once again, looked her straight in the eye. He wasn't going to pay attention to her looks until it drove her insane.

"Getting to the point of why you are here," he said. "I was noticing that the damage on this floor is slightly less severe than on the others." But instead of letting the compliment remain, he continued. "What can you tell me about the wards originally on the floor?"

She blinked. "You think the wards on this floor prevented the damage?" Her voice was incredulous.

He knit his brow. "Didn't it?"

"Look," she said, putting her hands on her hips, "the reason that this floor isn't smashed to hell like the rest is because I shielded it."

"But there were warders on the other floors as well," said Draco. "I've spoken to them and they seem very capable-,"

"Spoken to the other men and they seem capable?" she asked. "Are you saying I'm not as capable as the 'other men'?"

He adopted a confused and slightly flustered expression. "I, uh-,"

"So you think that because I was a woman, I wouldn't be able to hold my own, is that?"

"No, I-,"

"You think that perhaps my shields wouldn't be as powerful as theirs, because I'm a girl, so there must be another reason to why this floor is less damaged, huh?"

"No," he said. "Not at all. Your femininity had nothing to do with why I thought there were additional wards on this floor. I have registered that you are a woman, but that is all."

Her expression twisted there; he knew why. Women in the workplace had to prove that gender wasn't an issue, but that often meant there was no interest from the other men at their business. They fought so hard to prove they were just the same, all the males thought any reminder of their sex would be an insult, when in fact, sometimes these women wanted to be admired and flattered.

"All of the men on the other floors used the exact same spells, the spells they always use for storms," Draco continued. "I just assumed everyone cast the weather shield and hoped for the best when different spells should have been used, when some experimentation might have prevented damage. I'm sorry for assuming that all warders were similar and I did not mean to offend."

She was mollified and a tad embarrassed, but she hid it well.

"Maybe next time you won't be so quick to jump to conclusions," she said, and then stepped over a few other pieces of debris, picking her way to the middle of the room. "When I got into the room, the lights were already flickering," she said. "Then, before I could cast a thing, the middle one exploded and it all went dark. The Floos were already down, and the wind was picking up.

"The first thing I did was to activate my personal shield, standard procedure, and then I assessed the situation." She gave a slight snort. "The big guys back in the HQ said just to use the standard weather shield. They didn't want to risk us making things worse, but I could tell that a weather shield was going to do squat. So, I improvised."

Draco walked closer, his mind cataloguing and analyzing everything she said while also playing different scenarios, wondering what would be the best course of action to get her Floo address.

"I tried a simple magic shield first, protego, kid stuff. The shield went crazy and it rebounded off that desk there. Still, it held form, so I used caligo flabra. It didn't stop the ink pots from exploding, or from all those paper airplanes to go crazy, but all of the careening desks and dividers stopped."

"Caligo flabra," said Draco, raising an eyebrow. "That's one they don't teach at the school, isn't it?"

"It's in the text book," said Coriander, turning to him, "but just mentioned in passing. I thought 'dark winds' was an accurate description of what was happening. I hope that helps."

Draco shot her a small smile. "Well, it's good to know that if your modeling career doesn't break through, you'll have something else your incredible at," he said, pitching his voice softer so that Dumbledore and Kingsley, who were examining a toppled grandfather clock in the corner, wouldn't over hear.

She looked startled. "Are you flattering me?"

He cocked his eyebrow further and let his lips twitch into a smirk.

"You're making a move," she said, mock-scandalized but enjoying the attention.

"You just solved my case," he said. "Right now I'm enthralled with you."

"Mm-hmm, and you're how young?"

"I'm of age."

"Just barely."

"Does it really matter?" He stepped closer, dropped his voice lower. "I lied," he said. "I did more than register that you're female."

"How is it coming?" came Dumbledore's voice and Draco stepped back.

"I'm done," he said. "I'll walk Ms. Thompson back to the lobby, but I want to examine one of the filing cabinets from this floor and another from the floor above. If you could ask the Minister about moving them to the atrium, it would be easier to examine them there."

"Of course," said Dumbledore, but he looked at Draco and the warder with disapproval in his eyes. Draco honestly didn't care.

"Such a gentleman," said Coriander, but she walked right past him and to the stairs. He followed her, knowing that this too was just a test. Had he hastened to keep up with her, he would have been too desperate. Had he tried to start a conversation, he would have been too young. If he hadn't followed her, he wouldn't have been interested, so he followed her through the stairwell, matching her pace, until they came out into the atrium that was only filled with the few guards who hadn't gone on lunch break with the rest.

"This is my stop," she said.

"Would you like an escort to the Floo?" he asked, holding out a hand as if to a lady.

"You're five years younger than me," she started.

"I like older women."

She laughed, taking his hand. "I'm sure you do," she said. She started walking towards the fireplace, but slowly, and she still held his arm.

"I take it this means you like younger men?" Draco asked.

"I like smart men," she said. "You're only half of that, but you'll do."

They stopped right before the fireplaces and drifted into the small maintenance hall beside it. He skillfully backed her against the wall and reached out, brushing her hair softly back from her face. He could feel her heartbeat quicken as he rested his hand on the soft skin of her neck. From closer up, she had a light smattering of well-concealed freckles across her nose.

There was a flash of red in his mind, accompanied by another set of freckles, freckles that weren't covered up by concealer, freckles that adorned a straight nose and a pink set of cheeks, just below hazel eyes. Suddenly, having Coriander Thompson pressed against him wasn't right, and it wasn't her, oh no, she was as beautiful as ever, but something must be wrong with him. And for the first time, Draco hesitated.

It was just a brief moment where his hand stilled, and he paused as he was angling towards her lips, but it was eternity. A name was called to mind, a name that scared him even as he felt a prick of desire. Ginny Weasley.

The glitch was only half a second at most, but Coriander laughed, caught his hands, and gently pushed him back.

"Look, Draco," she said. "I'm flattered, really, but you don't want this."

"Don't want what?" he asked, cocking his head to the side, already planning on salvaging this connection with Coriander in hopes for a night to make him forget the girl with red hair and hazel eyes, the girl with the last name which clearly put her out of bounds.

"Don't want a quick shag with me," she said bluntly. "Or maybe you really do, but for the wrong reasons. Go out and find a girl your age, alright?"

He was already beginning to protest, but she stepped forward, pressed a kiss to his cheek and a card in his hand.

"In three years, if you're not married or with a girl, look me up," she said.

She sashayed away and then through the Floo, leaving him standing with her business card in hand and an array of thoughts in his head. He frowned and flipped the card through his fingers, turning from the Floo as the stairwell door opened across the hall and Dumbledore and Kingsley stepped through, floating a pair of cabinets along with them.

"Well?" asked Kingsley, raising his eyebrows and sharing a smile.

Draco shrugged and held up the card. "Got her number," he said.

Kingsley looked impressed; Dumbledore still looked disapproving. Draco pocketed the card and changed the subject.

"You can set the cabinets down now. This should just take a few minutes."

"And the reason we had to bring them down, was?" asked Kingsley.

"Magical residue," said Draco. "Whenever a magical object goes haywire, it leaves a certain static directly afterwards that can affect spells being cast in the general vicinity. There are less objects down here to retain that static so my spells will be cleaner."

He knelt by the cabinets and examined the drawers that had not been protected by Coriander's shield, the one from the other floor. The locking spells were just placed on the hinge mechanism, and the metal had been peeled back from the strain of the storm before completely giving in and splitting. Coriander's lock on the other hand just bore marks of strain, but remained largely undamaged.

He cast a few spells on each of the filing cabinets, gauging the amount of dark magic the equipment had absorbed and if the locking spells were still functional, even if the cabinet was broken. He let his fingers tap out their pattern as he ran the results through his head, trying to match dark curses with the after effects.

"Do you need to go back to your study?" asked Dumbledore. "Or something to write on, perhaps?"

"No," said Draco. He stood. "The storm itself was made up of several weather spells. Nebulosa, imbriferium pluvius, and most likely ventosus."

"I thought you said they ran the storm backwards," said Kingsley.

"They did," said Draco.

"But you just said-,"

"They caught the storm and put it in a time field," said Draco. "To run the storm backwards they would have introduced a few storm starting spells to reinitiate it."

"But how do you know what spells they used?"

"Magic has a life of its own," said Draco. "When it is used, it seeps into the environment, not by large amounts, but enough to be traceable if the spell was cast recently. Items exposed to a large quantity will retain more amounts, and if an object is constantly exposed to spells, it will 'come alive' with the magic in a sense. Ever wonder why your lights get temperamental, or after a while you have to get a new dicta-quill every few months? That's the magic taking hold."

"And you measured how much dark magic each cabinet has," said Kingsley.

Draco nodded. "The one that Coriander warded with the anti-dark weather spell only has trace amounts of dark magic. The other is showing a severe amount, which means that the storm was re-created with some of the darkest weather spells available. Nebulosa, pluvius, and ventosus."

He stepped back slightly, enjoying the small success, but a cold, drawling voice interrupted his thoughts.

"Well, what have we here?"

Draco whipped around. Lucius Malfoy stood a few feet from them, indigo robes draped over his frame, his white-blond hair perfectly combed, falling to his shoulders. One hand was resting on his favorite cane, a deep red-brown wood with silver bottom and tip. It wasn't a snake on the head of the cane though; no, it was a dragon.

Draco knew he paled. He knew because he could feel the blood drain from his face and he felt light-headed. He could only stare, completely shocked, but Kingsley Shacklebolt was trained for shock. As soon as he spotted Lucius Malfoy, he was stepping forward, and before Draco could do anything besides blink, he had neatly stepped in front of him, shielding him from view.

"Malfoy," he said, his voice hard. "I haven't seen you in a while. How long has it been since the last raid on your home?"

Lucius' eyes glinted, but he merely raised an eyebrow. "Last year for the fifth and last time. Your lack of incriminating evidence will keep you out of my home for quite awhile, my lawyers have seen to that."

"Don't be too sure," said Kingsley.

His father's lips twisted into a sneer, and then he turned to Dumbledore, not even glancing in Draco's direction. Draco didn't know if he should feel relieved or slighted.

"Ah, Dumbledore," said Lucius with a fake sort of geniality. "I did not realize that Fudge was so desperate he hired you to investigate the disturbance. Tell me, are the other officials really that inept?"

"Of course not," said Dumbledore, twinkling at the blond man, something which truly seemed to annoy Lucius. "Our team is just that good. What brings you to the Ministry at this time? I don't believe any of the offices are open."

Lucius shrugged, a motion that sent his fine robes rippling.

"I came to see the damage," he said, a small, cool smile on his lips. "While the Ministry will no doubt recover in a few days time, I don't doubt it might take a while to find the perpetrators, even if your team is that good, Albus."

"Huntington Lawn," said Draco, and at that his father started, so slight he was sure he was the only one who noticed it.

"What was that?" asked Dumbledore, turning his full attention to Draco.

"Huntington Lawn," Draco repeated. He had already plotted the course and speed of the storm in his head, and once he added in the additional time to modify the storm, he could get an approximate distance for the storm's origins. From then on it was just being familiar with the old, Pureblood estates outside of northern London. Huntington Lawn was mostly abandoned, but it held the space necessary for something as large as capturing a storm.

He continued with his analysis, wanting, for some insane reason, for Lucius to at least acknowledge his presence, to look at him, if only so he knew he still existed in his father's mind.

"That was where the storm would have been captured, contained, and reversed. No doubt the site has been cleared by now, but it wouldn't be too hard to extrapolate exactly who would have this sort of knowledge. A former student of wards and weather spells, perhaps one who has attended the Merlin Institute of Weather Control in Ireland. I'm sure you can find an applicable candidate from the enrollment papers there."

He knew he was right. He knew he was right even before his father's eyes flickered.

"I'll look right into that," said Dumbledore. He twinkled again as he turned to Lucius, and Draco had the feeling he was just doing so because it flustered his father. "I did tell you my team was good."

Lucius' cold mask slipped on, and he shrugged again, indolently, sending another ripple along his robes. His attention turned to the high, cracked ceiling of the atrium and then to the damage beyond.

"It does make you wonder though," he remarked casually, "why the child of magic and weather was…wasted on this." He smirked and looked back at them. His eyes were cruel as he turned further, locking gazes with Draco. "Has that thought crossed your mind?"

Draco couldn't move, couldn't even if he wanted. He stared back at his father, giving no expression and receiving none. Lucius was the first to break the gaze, but there was no victory in holding it longest. Lucius was brushing him off, and then he moved away, walking towards the entrance, his robes flowing around him. Draco watched him leave, his words finally registering, and bringing with it a sense of dread.

He was moving before he was even conscious of it, one soft word leaving his mouth.

"Merde!"

It was whispered, but the panic wasn't lost. He ran towards the stairwell door, jerking it open and taking the steps at a reckless pace. He ignored Dumbledore's shout and the sound of feet behind him. Only one thought remained: why hadn't he realized this sooner?

The storm was genius, more than genius. In fact, had the time been taken, the storm could have been far more deadly. Now, however, such a storm would be studied and new shields would be created to block it. Yes, it would still cause damage, but only slightly. Voldemort had wasted his finest creation and for what? So that the Ministry would be out less than a week on repairs? Draco didn't think so.

In fact, now that he realized it, it was glaringly obvious. After all, the Department of Mysteries was protected by much more than the simple 'dark winds' shield of Coriander Thompson. The department was shielded better than the rest of the Ministry, better than Hogwarts and Gringotts combined.

And there were private collectors who would have had a coin from the Quintus Flavius era. How come he hadn't seen this before? It was what his Boggart said, "Power hungry madmen only want one thing: power." And how did the Dark Lord get power? Through his Horcruxes.

He pushed open the last door, landing in the small atrium of the Department of Ministries and the doors weren't spinning, no, they were propped open, or at least, six of them were. The seventh, with the light on the bottom of it, was still shut. It was obvious that no one had the clearance to check for damage down here, or else the doors would have been reported already.

The Veil room was straight ahead and he sprinted it. There was a row of candles in a half-circle before the Veil, a path in the middle, and the stone floor in front of the tattered fabric was wet. He approached the Veil, already noting the folded piece of parchment spelled to the side of the arc. As he drew closer, he could make out his name written in red letters with a spidery hand.

He was close enough to touch the parchment now. Dumbledore and Kingsley's entrances, and Dumbledore's order of 'Don't!' weren't enough to deter him from reaching out. He knew nothing would happen.

He pulled the parchment down and stared at his name before unfolding the paper.

Draco –

No doubt you are close to discovering how the storm was called, but now you know why. I feel some acknowledgement is necessary as your instruction was the sole reason I have obtained my Horcrux. This is a vital step in regaining my footing as Dark Lord, and so, my Dragon, thank you.

Lord Voldemort

Do not think this assistance on your part will earn you any mercy in my sight the next time we meet.

Draco had read the message before Dumbledore had a change to snatch it away and cast a variety of revealing spells on the letter. When he was satisfied that the letter was not hexed, he skimmed over the contents, and then read them more slowly.

Draco turned around, running a hand through his hair and clenching his jaw in agitation. How could he have missed something like that? He had given the Dark Lord the ability to retrieve his Horcrux, and then had left. He should have insisted that the Order retrieve the Horcrux immediately. He should have gotten the Horcrux out himself. He should have realized that the Dark Lord was capable of something like this.

He didn't realize he had started to pace until Dumbledore's hand on his shoulder stopped him.

"Draco," said Dumbledore, his blue eyes sincere and for once not twinkling, "this is in no way your fault."

Draco stared back, a retort on the tip of his tongue, but Dumbledore spoke again.

"I mean this, Draco. This is in no way your doing; do not blame yourself."

Draco desperately wanted to say 'then who is to blame', but he knew the Headmaster would just say 'Voldemort' or some other ridiculous nonsense of the like, so he shut his mouth, and he nodded.

"Let's go back," said the Headmaster. "We'll talk about this then."

Bill wasn't in the dining room when Draco, Kingsley, and Dumbledore came back. He was with Fleur, rocking Lukas in his arms as the baby slowly fell asleep. The light by the door had flashed twice, alerting them that someone had arrived, but he didn't want to leave until Lukas was thoroughly asleep.

He looked around the room in contentment. He had roped his brothers in to setting up the room with the nursery furniture back at his house, and now the living room sported not only a king-sized bed, but a new crib, a cradle, a changing table and dresser for diapers and baby clothes, various mobiles and toys, a few select stuffed animals, and the rocking chair he was in. Hermione had even helped them change the color scheme from the darker burgundy to a soft yellow with blue carpet. It was a cheery room and sometimes he thought that he could stay in here forever.

Fleur and his mother were knitting in the couch that had been shoved to the back of the room and they had already finished a plethora of tiny baby socks and caps. Right now they were working on a blanket. Hermione had helped a bit with that, apparently she had plenty of experience because of her SPEW campaign. Ginny hadn't even attempted to join; she would never be a sewing girl and after The Sewing Machine Incident, Mrs. Weasley had no longer forced her to attempt anything relating to needles and thread. She had managed to stop Lukas' screaming fit earlier that day though.

Lukas gave a tiny cough that caused his nose to wrinkle and his face to scrunch. Bill smiled and shifted his grasp; it was surprising how heavy such a small bundle could get after half an hour.

There was a light knock on the door, and then it opened to reveal Dumbledore. His expression was grave and, what was more alarming, his eyes had lost their twinkle.

"What happened?" asked Bill, getting to his feet while trying not to wake Lukas.

"A few things," said Dumbledore. "Do you have a few moments?"

"Of course," said Bill, passing Lukas off to his wife and then following Dumbledore out to the dining room. Shacklebolt was there as well but Draco was absent.

"Voldemort regained his Horcrux," said Dumbledore once the door shut.

Bill blinked. "What?"

"He managed to get a coin from the Quintus Flavius era and he used the storm as a way to get everyone out of the Ministry building. The Department of Ministries is shielded against even the darkest of storms, and so Voldemort was able to recall his Horcrux."

"Shit," said Bill, dropping into a chair. "How-?" he started, but then he trailed off. He didn't even know what he was asking anymore. He took a breath and then started with the most important question. "Where's Draco?"

"In his study," said Dumbledore. "William, Tom wrote him a letter of thanks."

"What?"

"On the Veil where he would find it," said Dumbledore. "And Lucius was at the Ministry today."

"Shit," said Bill again. "Where's the letter?"

"Draco took it back from me," said Dumbledore. "I don't think he should have it."

"I don't think he's going to give it up," said Bill. "I'm going to go talk to him. I assume you called in the rest of the Order?"

"They'll be here in a few minutes."

Bill nodded and then left for Draco's study. The door was shut, which he expected, but it was also locked, which threw him. He didn't even think it had a lock.

He knocked. "Draco, it's Bill."

He could hear Draco's sigh through the wood, but then the door swung open revealing a very weary Draco Malfoy.

"Come for another therapy session?" he asked.

Bill wondered if Draco was getting sick of him showing up every time something went wrong, and then he decided he didn't care. Draco needed to learn to express his emotions, or at least talk about his feelings instead of bottling everything up.

Draco turned and went back to his chair. He slumped in it, idly walking a pencil through his fingers. Bill shut the door and then walked over to the other chair across from Draco. He pulled it out and sat, keeping his eyes on Draco who didn't once look up.

"Dumbledore told me what happened," he said.

Draco rolled his eyes but still didn't look up. Bill noticed the piece of parchment on the desk and picked it up.

"May I?" he asked, remembering another time when he hadn't asked permission.

Draco shrugged. "Go for it."

Bill opened the paper and read the message, feeling his stomach clench at the sick, twisted words. He resisted the urge to rip the sheet up into shreds because he doubted Draco really needed that right now.

"You do know that Voldemort is mad," he said.

Draco snorted, finally looking up. "Yes, Bill, I am aware of that."

"This is in no way your fault."

"You sound like Dumbledore."

"Well, he's right. You staged one of the biggest blows to Voldemort by feeding him that information and cleared Sirius' name. Don't forget that."

"Is that worth giving the Dark Lord another piece of his soul?"

"You didn't give him the Horcrux. You did everything in your power to stop him."

"No," said Draco. "I didn't. If I had, I would have taken the Horcrux the minute that Veil room was clear and blasted it with the darkest curses I could find."

"Draco, you were passed out in a hospital," said Bill. "There was nothing you could have done."

"And what about after?" Draco snapped. "It should have been my top priority."

"Stop blaming yourself for everything," said Bill. "It should have been our top priority, and it was. We had no idea that a storm like that was going to come, and we had no idea that Voldemort had found another coin. Sometimes we just get caught off guard, but you can't beat yourself up for it. Sometimes the bad guys win a round."

"And that's your philosophy on life? Sometimes the bad guys win a round?"

"Not entirely, but when they do, learn from the mistake, learn how to prevent anything like that from happening again, and move on. Just second guessing every step you made is just going to drive you insane."

Draco let out a breath and leaned back in his chair. Bill watched as he ran a hand through his hair, tugging slightly on the strands before letting out a half-laugh.

"I need a drink," he muttered.

Bill frowned in concern. The kid had just gotten clean from the Angel-Flight and he didn't want him turning to alcohol next, but Draco caught his frown.

"I want one, but that doesn't mean I'm actually going to get one," he said with another slight eye roll.

"Just making sure," said Bill. He could hear voices from down the hall and stood. "Coming to the meeting?"

"Yeah," said Draco, getting up as well, but it appeared to be a strain. Bill remembered that he hadn't slept at all last night, and he gave himself a reminder to get the kid to bed early.

The Order members arrived in a short amount of time, all of their expressions fearful because Dumbledore was still looking grave. None of them took the news about the Horcrux very well.

"It was his idea, wasn't it?" Mad-eye Moody growled, jumping up and staring straight at Severus. "You decided that the storm would occupy us and you covered for Voldemort."

Severus looked unimpressed. "I was unaware of the storm, just as everyone else was. The Dark Lord has only recently brought his research and experiment group into the Death Eaters awareness."

"A pretty story," Moody snapped. "What else are you feeding Voldemort, huh? Are you telling him about the meeting right now?"

"No, how could I tell the Dark Lord about it right now? I'm waiting for later of course."

Snape's dark humor was lost on Moody and Sirius didn't take it well either.

"Are you joking about this, Snivellus? I bet you think it would be funny to turn us all in, don't you?"

"Gentlemen," said Dumbledore, "please, this is no time for there to be a division among us."

"How do you even know that we're all on the same side?" asked Moody.

"I trust Severus explicitly," said Dumbledore, "as should you all."

"And what about the Malfoy boy?" Moody continued. "How do you know he's not playing some sort of elaborate game?"

Bill started forward at that, ready to jump in to defend Draco, and he noted that several other members looked about to speak up, but Draco startled them all by laughing.

"Are you serious?" he asked.

"No," Fred and George chimed in, pointing at Black, "he is." That earned them a dark look from their mother but Draco didn't even acknowledge them.

"I mean, honestly, if I or Snape had been working for the Dark Lord, everyone of you would be dead right now. How hard do you really think it is to kill a group of twenty-odd people? I can do it in a heartbeat, just give me the right ingredients. I think you all need to realize that if anyone of us was working for the Dark Lord, he would have made his move already."

"Snape is a Death Eater," said Moody, "so why aren't we dead already?"

Draco looked heavenward as if praying for patience. "Because," he said slowly, "his true allegiance is here. Furthermore the Dark Lord doesn't trust Snape. If he did, he would have used him to play an integral part in an ambush for all of you, but the Dark Lord can't know for sure if he wouldn't double cross him. Besides, he has no clue that Snape is even a part of the Order. He is just using him to keep an eye on Harry at Hogwarts."

"I still don't trust you," said Moody, "nor do I think anyone else should. It's a mistake trusting anyone remotely Slytherin. I'm keeping an eye on you."

His magical eye swiveled to Draco menacingly. Draco shocked Bill, and the rest of the table, by flipping Moody the backwards peace sign. Before anyone could to anything more than choke on coffee – Kingsley had just taken a sip of his and Lupin had to pound him on the back – Draco stood, scraping his chair back.

"While all of you sit and debate the finer points of Judas and thirty pieces of silver, I'm going to work on something useful which may actually help us win this war."

And then he strode out of the room and to his study, shutting the door forcefully. Bill had no doubt he locked it once more and warded it for noise. The table exchanged looks; Dumbledore turned to Bill who sighed and shook his head.

"You'll have to excuse Draco," said Dumbledore. "He's had a rather trying morning. Now, Harry hasn't had any visions yet, so I believe we can assume that Voldemort hasn't rejoined the Horcrux to him."

"What does the rejoining do?" asked Arthur.

"Voldemort created the Horcruxes to ensure his immortality," said Dumbledore. "That was why the rebound of the Avada didn't kill him, but because he was so weak from splitting his soul, he became nothing more than a spirit. Now, however, he has regained strength through other dark means, so he is essentially human once more. When he regained his Horcrux from Nagini, his power doubled. It is my belief that he will continue restoring his soul so that he will have the advantage when he finally faces Harry. We know of the Horcruxes now, and should he once more have his body damaged as he did after failing to kill Harry, we would not rest until everyone is found and destroyed. He knows that, which is why he is piecing his soul back together."

"How does he join the Horcrux back to himself?" asked Hermione.

"Someone must willingly die for him," said Dumbledore. "Unfortunately, that means he uses the Imperius curse on the unsuspecting."

"If the Horcruxes can increase the caster power thought, why haven't more people tried it?" she asked.

"Normally rejoining a Horcrux would not do so," said Dumbledore. "But when Voldemort was wounded, I think the connection between him and the Horcruxes was broken because he was too weak to sustain them. Like any living thing, they grew, which is why he gains power by rejoining them. While it may not appear so, this is to our advantage. He should be able to locate his remaining Horcrux, the Hufflepuff goblet, simply because it is a part of him and he should feel its presence, but he cannot. We need to find that cup before he does."

Yay for angsty Draco. Please leave a review on your way out.





7. Forgotten Dreams

Disclaimer: Yeah, right.

Author's Note: Hi. I'm sorry. I suddenly realized how important this chapter was to the fourth story and needed to plot out the basics of the fourth so I could write this one, even though nothing will come into play in this story, so you had to wait. Apologies.

Draco decided that, after he slammed shut his study door, flipping Moody off in front of the entire Order may not have been one of his most mature moments, but he couldn't bring himself to feel guilty or embarrassed. The ex-Auror had been asking for it.

He scowled at his table which was covered in various books and parchments. A flick of his wand sent everything except a piece of parchment and a quill to the bookcases that lined the back wall. He pulled out a chair and sat, his hand reaching for the quill as his mind sped through hypotheses and possibilities. Along with the thoughts came a dull ache from the base of his skull. A migraine was slowly building.

There was a knock on the door fifteen minutes later. Draco looked up.

"What?" he asked, his voice clipped.

"Can I come in?"

It was Bill and he sounded hesitant. Draco remembered his snide comment about therapy sessions before the Order meeting and wondered if Bill had taken it to heart. He hadn't meant to offend Bill, knowing that the eldest Weasley sibling was only trying to help. He also had a sneaking suspicion that Bill might actually be right about the whole 'sharing your feelings' thing, but he was sick of people checking up on him. He was a bloody genius, for Merlin's sake. He wasn't helpless.

He waved his wand, pulling down the locking charm.

"It's open."

Bill stepped in, giving him a small smile.

"What are you working on?"

"A ward specifically for the storm."

"There are specialists working on that," said Bill.

Draco scoffed. "The wards the 'specialists' will be working on will only seek to protect from the storm."

"And yours does more," said Bill.

"I'm working on a way to deactivate the storm while tracking it back to its point of origin."

There was a pause, but then Bill spoke again.

"Should you really be working on this right now?"

Draco frowned. "Why wouldn't I?"

Bill shrugged. "I just think you need a break, you know? You've just recovered from the past few weeks, and then you go and deliver Lukas, and now you're working on a highly intricate shield. Maybe it's too much."

"It's not."

"I mean, you haven't even slept last night."

"Because I slept all of yesterday," said Draco.

"I'm just saying, maybe you should take a step back."

"I like to keep busy."

Another beat.

"Is it because of Lucius?"

Draco put down his quill. "What about him?"

"Dumbledore said you saw him today. Did he say anything?"

"Besides hinting at the fact that the storm was a decoy, no."

"And that bothers you," said Bill.

Draco scoffed again and looked back down at his paper.

"Draco, you have a right to be angry at him."

"I'm not."

"Upset then."

"I'm not upset."

"Then why aren't you looking at me?"

"Because, right now, I don't want to talk about this."

"You want to just bury yourself in your work, is that it?" asked Bill. "So you can forget."

Draco remained silent.

"This is something you can't just brush off," said Bill. "It's not going to go away just because you distract yourself. He's your father, and he hurt you, and it is okay to be angry at that. It's okay to be mad at him."

"I'm not mad at him," said Draco. The migraine was growing; he tried to push it aside.

"You can't keep acting like this isn't bothering you."

"I said I wasn't mad at him," Draco snapped, looking up and glaring at Bill. "Can you stop interrogating me now?"

"And leave you to sulk in your work? To distract yourself until you burn out?"

"I'm not going to burn out."

"If you keep up like this, you will. Come on, you can talk to me. If you're not angry at him, who are you mad at? Voldemort? Moody? Me?"

"Well, right now I'm a little frustrated."

Bill just smiled grimly and pulled out the other chair. He sat in it and raised his eyebrows at Draco, almost challengingly. Draco sighed and slumped back; he had learned when it was better to just give in to the damned red-heads.

"I'm not mad at…him," he said. Calling him 'father' was wrong, but 'Lucius' seemed so formal and distant. "I'm mad that I'm angry."

Bill frowned and Draco sighed again, shifting in his seat.

"He never…he never said that he cared for me. I mean, he cared for me, but he never said it, he never said…," he trailed off.

"He never said that he loved you," Bill guessed.

"No," said Draco, shaking his head. "Malfoy's never admit to that. We do have endearments that are acceptable, but he never said them to me. I just…I liked to think that when he took me places or bought me things, he did care for me. But after seeing him at the Ministry, he didn't say anything. He didn't notice that I was there at all and now I think he never did and I…I'm upset that I made myself believe he did care for me. I'm angry that I'm this upset when I should have seen all along that I was nothing to him."

Once the words were out of his mouth, he felt even more angry and he had to bite back a curse. Wasn't he supposed to feel better now? Wasn't this whole 'talking about feelings' supposed to bring some relief? Just another thing he had believed that turned out not to be true. For a genius, he was exceedingly illiterate when it came to these emotional sorts of things. He wished he was back in his apartment, burying himself in the shield, not here, not now.

"Draco," said Bill, and then he stopped as if debating what to say. "You said that Lucius helped you through your addiction during the summer. Now I would like to believe that your father is a cold bastard, that he is evil incarnate because-," Bill seemed to check himself right there and Draco frowned, but Bill continued.

"Because of who he is and what he does, but from what you said of him, I can't believe that. He took that entire summer off for you and that is a definite indication that he does care. You said that he killed his own mother for what she did to Lukas, and I am positive, that if she had tried to harm you, he would have done far worse."

Draco rolled his eyes. "That's all speculation; you don't even know him. Your entire argument is based on hearsay."

"You're right, I don't know him," said Bill. "But I do know you."

"What does that have to do with anything?"

"Because I believe that any person with the smallest amount of brain power will realize what a special kid you are. Yes, you can be a right bastard when you wish, but underneath that is an incredibly sharp, witty, and thoughtful boy that no one could not care for."

Draco snorted. "Half your Order hates me. You've just disproved your own theory."

"Half of them don't know you," said Bill. "And my family, and Sirius and Kingsley, were ready to jump down Moody's throat. And I think they would have if you hadn't proved just how well you can handle yourself."

Draco shifted at that. They had?

"Although," Bill continued, "for future reference, storming out of the room is a little bitchy."

Draco snorted, feeling his lips twitch up at that. "Noted."

"And I mean what I said," said Bill. "Lucius has to care for you; he's probably just completely unreadable. You get that from him."

Draco nodded. It was true; he had learned from the best and no doubt his mask would have been perfected by the time he graduated if he hadn't met Bill in sixth year. That little bit of friendship had halted all improvements on his cold façade.

"Now," said Bill, letting out a breath, "let's get you off of this ward thing, you can work on it later. We are going to have some fun."

He pulled away the parchment from the table and then pulled the translating journals off of the bookshelf.

"You are going to catch me up, and then we are going to have the translations done by the time school starts again. And if we aren't done, I'll hold you from school just so we can finish. I'm desperate to publish a book, if only so I don't have to go back to work on the bank."

"Are finances tight?" asked Draco.

"No. Fleur gets paid maternity leave from her design job and the Ministry paid well on my coding gig," said Bill. "So we're fine, but I would have to get a job if only to keep myself busy. But, I figure if I publish a book, then I would have an excuse to work on other runes, even if I don't get anywhere."

He plopped the journals down on the table and sat again. Draco leaned closer, and although he did feel better, something which surprised him, his migraine throbbed and he winced, reaching up to rub his temples.

"You alright?" asked Bill.

"Just a headache," said Draco.

"So that means a migraine, right?"

"A slight one," Draco admitted because he doubted Bill would believe him if he said no.

"Do you want a pain reliever?"

"They don't really help."

"You want to lie down for a bit?"

"I'll be fine."

"You sure?"

"Bill?"

"Yeah?"

"Shut up."

Bill laughed; Draco picked up his quill.

Draco liked working with Bill. The Weasley was familiar with all types of runes and grammar styles, which made him a quick study, and he had experience in the field which meant that he often had good insight when trying to translate between two similar dialects.

Bill had also studied up on the Persian Runes and the advancements that Draco had made. After a short review, where they plotted out the changes from five through two, they got started on the first.

Although Draco did find some catharsis talking to Bill, it was a little harder to focus, but that could just be the headache that was currently residing in the back of his brain. He doubted anything but a whiskey-diluted pain reliever and a two hour nap would help, and the cure didn't seem enticing at the moment, the whiskey because he was still waiting for the remaining craving for the Angel-Flight to dissolve, and the nap because he was never able to sleep during the day and he would just lie on his bed with nothing to think about except unpleasant recent events. That was something he could do without.

Bill didn't seem in perfect condition either. He was constantly rolling his shoulders back and twisting his neck from side to side.

"Long night?" asked Draco.

"Slept funny," said Bill. "I took a muscle relaxant this morning, but I think it's wearing off. I must have really been in the wrong position."

Draco watched him roll his neck back in a circle and snorted.

"To say the least," he said, and looked back down at the parchment.

He looked right back up when the door opened and Ginny came through. She was one person he could have gone without speaking to, especially after his failed attempt with Coriander. He couldn't understand why he was constantly thinking about her, why someone who was completely aggravating to him also intrigued him. It didn't help that she was a cute girl to begin with.

Right now her hair was free, falling over her shoulders and curling at the ends. In contrast to her hair, her clothes were older, obviously of the 'lay about the house' persuasion, but while her trousers were worn and torn at the cuffs, they clung to her hips and thighs. Her shirt was faded and long-sleeved but every time she moved, a glimpse of her stomach showed. He stared for an entire two seconds before remembering exactly who she was.

"Hey, Mum says dinner's in half an hour," she said, approaching the table. "What are you working on?"

"Persian Runes," said Bill, now rubbing the back of his neck.

"Which one?" she asked.

"First."

"Made any progress?"

"A fair amount," said Bill, still rubbing and then Ginny laughed.

"Here, let me."

She stepped behind her brother and rubbed the back of his neck, digging her thumbs into his shoulders.

"Right here?" she asked.

"Up a little, yeah," said Bill, half grimacing. He groaned as she continued rubbing, the tension draining from his neck and shoulders.

"You really shouldn't sleep in chairs," said Ginny. "You're not exactly young anymore."

"Hey!" said Bill. "I am not old."

"I didn't say you were old. I just said you were no longer young."

"Not being young implies being old."

"Does not."

"Does too. Draco, aren't I right?"

Draco shrugged. "Not really. It depends how the word is used semantically."

"You're supposed to tell her that I'm right," said Bill.

"I stick with the facts," said Draco, turning back to the papers.

"Ha!" said Ginny, patting Bill's shoulders in victory and then stepping around him to look at the papers. She screwed up her face at the glyphs.

It was all Draco could do not to look at her, trying to stay concentrated on his work. The migraine was now throbbing and his hand absent-mindedly rose to rub at his temples as he skimmed at the notes he had made so far. He must have been wincing because Bill spoke.

"I can get you a pain reliever. Maybe it won't cure a migraine, but it should at least take the edge off."

Draco shook his head. "I'm fine."

"Do you get migraines a lot?" asked Ginny.

He shrugged. "Now and then."

"Are you sure it isn't a tension headache? Percy, the brother we don't talk about any more, used to think his tension headaches were migraines."

Draco looked up at that. He had known that there was some division in the Weasley family, but how far had it gone? Bill's eyes had darkened a bit and Draco raised an eyebrow at him.

Ginny crossed behind him, and he started to turn, but she stopped him with her hands on his shoulders.

"Hold still," she commanded.

"What are you– shit!"

He jerked away. Her fingers had pressed on the base of his neck and something had twinged, sending a bolt of pain right up into the base of his skull.

"See?" said Ginny, sounding quite smug. "It's a tension headache."

"Thank you for the secondary diagnosis," said Draco, his voice biting, and then her hands returned to his shoulders. He started to turn again to shove her off. Now his neck was sore as well and he didn't want her pressing any further. Besides, he was never fond of physical proximity, especially when someone else's hands were right by his neck as strangulation was entirely too easy in that position. Ginny shoved him back around; she had the leverage.

"Sit," she commanded.

Draco wanted to object, but then her fingers gently kneaded the muscles in the base of his neck. He paused because the touch was pleasant, more than pleasant, and then her fingers slid over a group of knotted muscles and slowly rolled over them.

If Draco had been an expressive person, he would have groaned at the relief. As it was, his head dropped forward, almost of its own accord. Bill laughed at him, but Ginny obligingly massaged the strained area.

Draco could feel the pressure running from his back to his head, but with the pressure, his headache steadily lessened. She worked her way down to his shoulders and he could feel himself starting to relax, could feel his muscles loosening, and then, as her fingers moved from his shoulders to his bare neck, he felt something completely different.

He was suddenly aware of the heat radiating from her fingers, and the way it soothed his cool skin. She was leaning forward and a bit of her hair brushed against him, teasing him with the light touch because, if he moved backwards only a few inches, he would be pressed against her chest. She smelled of lavender and vanilla, no doubt the shampoo she used.

He suddenly wanted her to stop because she was confusing him again. No, she wasn't confusing. He was confusing himself with his apparent enthrallment. He was relieved when Mrs. Weasley called down the hall for her to help with dinner.

"I've got to go," she said, giving his shoulders on last squeeze. "Feeling any better?"

"Yeah, thanks." He said it casually, like he hadn't been enjoying her touch more than he should.

"Good," she said, and he could hear the smile in her voice. "And good luck with your runes."

He watched her leave, eyes drifting to the sliver of back that her shirt rode up to expose before remembering who else was in the room, and he made it look as if he was merely making sure the door was closed all the way.

"Headache gone?" asked Bill.

"Mostly," said Draco, twisting his neck experimentally. He could feel that the muscles were looser, and the sharp pain had lessened to a dull ache.

"Think you'll be able to concentrate now? I mean, I am doing all of the work here," Bill teased.

Draco looked down at the parchment in front of him and then blinked. He hadn't noticed that before. He turned the parchment to Bill.

"I got the verbs."

Bill stared at him. "You serious?"

"Yeah."

"How?"

He shrugged. "It just sorta hit me."

Bill pulled the parchment closer and frowned. "Show me."

So Draco did, and Bill caught on before dinner was put on the table. After the meal, where Draco steadfastly avoided the youngest Weasley, they worked a bit more but then Bill called it quits for the night.

"I'm gonna turn in," he said. "You should get to bed as well."

Draco frowned and Bill sighed.

"At least go to bed at a somewhat decent hour."

Draco nodded, and then brought up a few journals to his room to work on. Everyone else was heading to bed as well. It seemed there was nothing more straining than finding out that the opposing faction had won a major victory.

After cleaning his teeth and changing into a pair of pajama pants, he sat down to read a little. He wasn't prepared to be so tired, and he only made it through a few pages before turning off the lights and crawling into bed. Normally he would put a silencing charm on his door, but it seemed quiet, and just then, he was too tired to care. He halfway realized that something seemed to be pulling under, but it was too late to fight.

'Hello, again.'

Draco whirled around, spotting the open door of the Veil room. He stepped in.

'Right back at you,' he said. 'You were decidedly allusive the last time we talked, and I would like a few questions answered.'

'There is no time for that. You did not perform the ritual.'

'Because the Horcrux was already removed.'

'Yes, it was. But you did not come into direct contact with our plane and the connection is weak. We are using your own magical energies to speak with you, and wasting time could bring damage to your mind and body.'

'So I'll go back, toss some blood in, and we can have a longer conversation.'

'We cannot speak with you after this.'

'Why not?'

'Because with the retrieval of Sirius Black and the Horcrux, there is nothing anchoring us to this world and our influence will die out until another crosses the Veil.'

'There must be thousands who have crossed over," said Draco.

'Yes, but those who have crossed the boundary have done so hundreds of years ago. They have passed out of human thought, and so we have as well.'

'What do you want?'

'To save your world.'

'Shouldn't you talk to Harry Potter then? Perhaps you've heard of him. He's my age, really messy hair, scar on his forehead?'

'He cannot defeat the one known as Voldemort on his own.'

'And you think I can help?'

'You are the only one who can help.'

'How so?'

'The door must be opened.'

'What door?'

'The seventh door must be open and its power must be unleashed.'

'How do I do that?'

'You must speak in the unknown tongue the words of the forgotten.'

Draco rolled his eyes. 'Look, you were the one that said time was of the essence. Can't you speak a little plainer?'

'You will understand when you are ready.'

'I'm not ready now?'

A chuckle. 'Do you know what is behind the door?'

'It is widely theorized that the door is love,' said Draco.

'But you don't believe that love has a power of its own.'

It was not a question, but Draco felt he should answer it anyway.

'Love is an emotion,' he said. 'It can be manipulated, feigned, and even destroyed.'

'And that is why you are not ready, but when you are, you will remember.'

'What do you mean, I will remember?'

'When you wake, you will not remember us. Not until you truly understand.'

Draco stared at the Veil. 'This is absolutely ridiculous, you do know that, right?' he asked, completely fed up with whoever it was behind that Veil.

'Good-bye.'

'No, wait!'

"Draco!"

Someone was calling his name; it sounded distant. Even as he was trying to gauge the distance, he felt himself rushing forward, as if propelled by some unseen force.

There was a sting on his face.

"Draco, wake up dammit!"

He was trying; he could feel himself slowly rising into awareness. He could hear voices, feel the bed beneath him, and someone's arms propping him up. But no, he didn't want to go because he needed to remember something.

'Good-bye, Draco. We shall see you when the time is right.'

'Wait!'

He bolted upright, gasping in a breath even as hands reached out to him. He jerked away, still half-asleep, but managing to identify the cluster of people around his bed.

"The hell?" he demanded, just barely remembering to speak in English.

Harry woke the entire house up at two in the morning. Well, everyone except Fleur and Lukas who were in the shielded living room, but Lukas had wanted to be fed at one, and had woken up both Fleur and Bill. Fleur had gone right back to sleep; Bill hadn't.

After tossing and turning for half an hour, he got up and left for the kitchen to find himself some chamomile tea. That was when he heard the screams.

He ran upstairs, already knowing who they belonged to. Ron and Hermione beat him into Harry's room. Sirius was right behind him.

"Harry! Harry, wake up," Hermione commanded, grabbing Harry's hand. The boy-hero was trembling, eyes squeezed shut.

Sirius brushed by Bill and gently shook his godson, looking pale at the screams. Harry finally did wake up, clamping his mouth on a yell and his hand flying up to the scar on his forehead. Bill could see him gritting his teeth.

Dumbledore was in the room then, as was Arthur and Molly. His mother was trying to tell Ginny to go back to bed, but Ginny pushed her way into the room to stand with Ron and Hermione.

"Are you alright, Harry?" Sirius asked, sitting beside the boy now, reaching one hand out to rub Harry's back as he took a few deep breaths.

"Yeah," said Harry. He swallowed and nodded. "I'm alright."

"What did you see, Harry?" asked Dumbledore.

Harry looked up at the Headmaster, his eyes troubled. "Voldemort took back his Horcrux."

Dumbledore nodded. "It was expected. Come, you look like you could do with a cup of hot chocolate, and then you can tell us what happened."

Harry nodded and Sirius helped him out of bed, giving the boy a jumper to pull on over his pajamas and the troupe started for the stairs. Bill followed, but he stopped when he saw the closed door across from Harry's room.

"Wait," he said. "Draco didn't wake up?"

Ginny and Hermione paused as well.

"Neither did Fred and George," said Ginny. "Or Charlie."

Bill shook his head. "Draco can't sleep through a pin drop and he's right across from Harry."

"Did he shield his room?" asked Hermione.

"He could have," said Bill, staring at the closed door. He stepped closer and reached out, slowly turning the doorknob. It was unlocked and he pushed the door open a crack.

The room was dark, but the beam of light from the hall hit the bed. Bill could just make out Draco's form under the covers.

"I guess he did sleep through it," he whispered back.

"He did look tired today," said Hermione.

Bill nodded, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. When Draco had been sick his sixth year, he stirred even when he had had been pumped full of sleep-aids. Surely he would wake with the door open.

"Draco," he said.

"You're going to wake him up," said Ginny.

"Draco," he called louder, voice growing with apprehension. "Draco!"

There wasn't even the hint of motion.

"Something isn't right," said Bill, throwing the door open the rest of the way. The lights sprang on as he crossed to the bed. He could see Draco now, wearing a loose pair of cotton sweats, facedown on the bed, his arm flung loosely over a pillow.

"Draco!"

Bill was at his bed now, reaching out and shaking him lightly on the shoulder. Draco was unresponsive and for one sick, horrid minute, Bill thought he was dead. He immediately pressed on Draco's neck, searching for and finding his pulse. Now that he was close, he could see that Draco's back was rising and falling, but his breath was quick, strained.

"Draco, wake up, come on," Bill muttered, carefully rolling him over, slapping his face lightly.

Still no response. He turned to the door where Ginny and Hermione were standing, looking at him, waiting for him to tell them what was wrong.

"Get Dumbledore," he ordered. "He's not waking up."

Ginny took off and Bill turned back to Draco, noting that the kid's brow was furrowed, his jaw clenched.

"Damn it, Draco."

He didn't have his wand on him, and he wondered if trying to cast the waking charm was even a good idea. There were footsteps on the stairs; Bill slapped Draco's face again.

"What's happened?" asked Dumbledore, bearing straight for the unconscious boy as those recently awake filtered in as well, wondering what this new drama was.

"He won't wake up."

Dumbledore reached out, feeling Draco's forehead and then pulse. He cast a diagnostic charm and frowned.

"What is it?" Bill asked.

"His magical energy is low." He cast a few more charms, reading Draco's vital signs before pointing his wand at Draco's head. "Ennervate."

Bill could see the spell hit, even causing Draco's head to rock, but it was just motion from the spell. The boy's eyelids didn't so much as flicker.

"Here's the med kit," said Molly, handing Dumbledore a black box. Dumbledore opened it, pulling out the blue vial of the simple waking potion and the yellow used in case of a coma.

"Could you sit him up, William?" asked Dumbledore.

Bill nodded and climbed onto the bed, scooting his arm under Draco's neck and lifting him into a half-reclined position. Dumbledore gently opened his clenched teeth by pressing on the back of his jaw. He poured the potion in and followed it with a swallowing charm.

They stepped back and waited, but Draco remained unconscious, completely limp. Bill turned to Dumbledore, the fear in his eyes.

"I don't know," said Dumbledore, shaking his head. "He appears to be simply sleeping."

"What did you say about his magical signature, though? What about that?"

"It would cause fatigue, but not to this extent." But even as he spoke, his eyebrows knit.

"What?" Bill demanded.

"There have been cases where, when paired with injury, magical exhaustion has created more severe side affects. Sometimes the body shuts down to prevent further wear, but that is all I can think of to match these symptoms."

"But he's recovered," said Bill.

"Maybe not enough," said Dumbledore.

"What happens when the body shuts down?"

Dumbledore looked grave. "It can lead to death."

Bill looked down at the boy in his arms and shook him slightly.

"Draco!" His voice was sharp, worried.

This time the slap even hurt his hand and left a red mark on Draco's cheek.

"Draco, wake up dammit."

He waited, knowing that Draco had to be too stubborn to just slip into a coma. He thought he might have imagined the small flicker of Draco's eyelids. He knew he didn't imagine the slight turn of Draco's head.

"Draco?"

Draco bolted forward, eyes springing open as he sat all the way up, startling the entire room. For a few seconds his eyes fluttered in the bright light, still unfocused from sleep, but then widen at the sight of the onlookers crowded around his bed.

"The hell?"

The words leaving Draco's mouth were the best Bill had heard in a long time. Draco's grey eyes turned to him, the question in them.

"You wouldn't wake up," he said.

Draco blinked, looked around once again, and then looked at the clock.

"And you are awake, because?" He raised an eyebrow as he did that, the faint condescension impossible to miss. Bill gave a breath of relief at that typical Malfoy attitude.

"I had a bad dream," said Harry, speaking up.

"And by dream you mean a vision," said Draco.

"Yeah," said Harry.

"And by vision you must mean that the Dark Lord rejoined with his Horcrux."

"Yeah."

Draco looked at the crowd again, frowning slightly, but then untangled his feet from the covers and got up. And Bill could only stare, along with everyone else, as he crossed to his wardrobe and pulled out a black t-shirt. Of course, most of the other people in the room were staring at the tattoo on his back which was marred by still-pink burn marks, but Draco had gone from almost comatose to showing no signs of illness and the change was startling. Draco pulled the shirt on and then turned to face them all, leaning back against his wardrobe door.

"So I'm assuming this all means that we need to get started tracking the remaining Horcrux," he said, obviously referring to the occupants of his room. He turned to Dumbledore. "If the cup was stolen, like you suspect, then I know a few mathematical equations I can apply to retrace-,"

"No!"

Bill's exclamation was echoed by the entire room and Draco frowned.

"Tell me again why you are all even in my room to begin with?"

"Because you wouldn't wake up," said Bill. "Harry woke up half the house yelling, and you slept right through it. When does that happen?"

"I shield my room," said Draco.

"Not tonight," said Bill. "And even if you did, I've been slapping you for the past five minutes. How did you sleep through that?"

"I slept through it?" Draco asked, reaching up to touch his still-reddened cheek.

"The point is, my boy," said Dumbledore, "that you've worn yourself out. This could be a sign that you've been working to hard and need a break. I don't want you working on any projects for the next few days. You need to rejuvenate."

"Wait a minute," said Draco. "You think that I've worn out my magical aura to the point of a self-initiated coma simply because I, for the first time in my life, am a heavy sleeper?"

"Draco, he used enervate on you," said Bill. "And a waking potion."

That caught Draco off guard for a moment, but then he shrugged it off. "That doesn't mean I'm magically exhausted. There are several other explanations for it."

"Such as?" Bill asked.

And Draco actually hesitated, frowning slightly, as if he was really trying to think of why he didn't wake up, but he couldn't answer. He didn't know either.

"But still," he argued, "simply jumping to the conclusion because nothing else fits is a terrible way to diagnose someone, especially because I am not displaying the side effects of a coma. I'm not shaking; I have lucid thought processes and full speech capabilities and no muscle fatigue."

"But your magical signature is much lower than it should be," said Dumbledore. "You recently recovered from a few harrowing experiences in which you were injured, and you did not stir at the charm or potion. There is no other explanation for it."

"That we know of," said Draco.

"Then all the more reason to be careful," said Dumbledore. "And either way, a cup of hot chocolate would do you good as well before bed."

So, yes, you read the Author's note right. There will be a fourth story, although I will not write it when this one is finished. Why, because honestly, I don't think I'd be able to do so. I need a break. I will be posting another story in between this one and the fourth, maybe two. I dunno. I have a few story lines lined up.

Well, that's all. Again, no time for replies to reviews. I did start for some of you, but I'm wicked crazy this semester with classes. Insanity. But, I'm relatively free this weekend, so the next chapter should be up on time. I might even get a head start on some more chapters, how cool would that be?





8. Flirting, Fights, and French

Disclaimer: If I own Harry Potter, I would have a private tutor teach me French so I could stop using those amazing, but inaccurate, automatic translating websites.

Thanks to my amazing reviewers!

Draco accepted the cup of hot chocolate from Dumbledore with ill-grace, still fuming. Yes, he was feeling a little tired…alright, to be completely honest, he was feeling drained, more so than usual, but it was two in the morning so he had an excuse….again, that wasn't completely true and some of his exhaustion could be attributed to the fact that he was probably overworking, but he had been doing so for years now. He doubted it would suddenly hit him like it had this night. There must be some other cause.

He stared at the dark, steaming liquid, ignoring everyone around him. It was actually rather easy; they were all speaking in whispers, as if afraid to set him off. They read the ice in his expression correctly. At least, all of them but Ginny Weasley.

He didn't look up when she sat across from him with her own mug. He did when a tiny marshmallow glanced off the rim of his cup and fell to the table with the softest of landings.

The youngest Weasley had a collection of marshmallows on the table in front of her. She picked up another and tossed it again. This time the marshmallow landed in his hot chocolate with a tiny splash.

"One point!" she cheered for herself. She ate one in victory and smiled at him.

"Do you mind?" asked Draco.

"Oh, sorry. I thought I was invited to your pity party and I was just trying to liven it up a bit."

"Cute, Weasley." His tone was indication otherwise.

"It's Ginny, remember?"

"The terms were that I would call you Ginny if you left my study because you were bothering me. You're breaking the intent of the contract."

"I asked you to call me Ginny because you were being distant and aloof. Now you're moping and distancing yourself again so I could say the same for you."

"That's stretching it."

She smiled. "Just a little bit. Besides, everyone likes marshmallows."

"And if I said I didn't?"

"You would be lying."

"I'm not."

She stared. "Are you serious?"

"Do I look like I'm joking?"

"You never look like you're joking."

"Well, I'm not."

"You're not human," she informed him. She took his mug and fished out the marshmallow with her spoon and ate it. "There," she said, giving the mug back to him. "No more marshmallow."

"I appreciate it."

"Don't sound so grateful," said Ginny. "Really, it was no trouble at all."

He rolled his eyes. She tossed a marshmallow into the air and caught it with her mouth. He shook his head and took a sip of his hot chocolate.

"You know," said Ginny, regarding him thoughtfully, "if you want to bitch about how unfair everyone is being, you can go ahead."

"I'm not going to bitch," said Draco.

"I hear it helps."

"You are just like your bother, aren't you?"

"In what sense?"

"The whole talking sense."

"I like to talk," she admitted. "I also like to listen."

"I'm not so much a fan of talking."

"So I've heard."

She giggled at her own pun. The late hour was obviously affecting her, at least, that was what the dark circles on her face was saying. She rubbed her eyes, scrunching her nose as she did so.

"Can't handle the late nights?" he asked.

"Says the boy who nearly fell into a coma from exhaustion."

"I was not in a coma and it wasn't from exhaustion. It's just the only explanation they can think of and certain over-protective and unnecessary concerns have further led to their conclusion and no, that wasn't bitching, so don't go looking so victorious."

She frowned and dropped a few marshmallows in her drink, dunking them under with her spoon.

"It sounded like it."

"It wasn't."

Draco sipped at his hot chocolate, letting his mind wander back to that night. He was still trying to figure out why he hadn't woken up, but nothing was making any sense. He refused to believe that he had worked himself into exhaustion. Yes, he had been pushing himself for the past, well, for the past few years, but that shouldn't have sent him into a coma. There was another answer for it; he knew there was. He just had to find it.

"Draco," said Bill.

Draco turned. "What?" he asked, his voice cold.

"Stop thinking so hard. That's what got you in trouble to start with."

Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm going to bed," he said, sliding his chair back.

"Straight to bed. No working on any of your projects," said Bill.

"If you have trouble sleeping, there's some sleep-aid in the bathroom cabinet," said Dumbledore.

Draco didn't deign to answer because he might end up letting loose a few profanities. He did shoot them a cold glare, the kind that he usually reserved for his Slytherins when they dared to step over the line. Bill just gave him a comforting smile and Dumbledore twinkled.

Draco wondered if the glare was ineffective because they knew him so well, or if because it only worked on Slytherins. Maybe a bit a both. It could also have been impeded by the fact that he was in pajamas.

He cleaned his teeth again and then made sure to ward his door. He turned off the lights and crawled into bed, turning his mind to any reason he might have slept so hard. There must be something he was missing; something they were all missing. He felt as if the answer was just out of reach, just out of memory, and that frustrated him beyond measure.

Normally he would be able to keep himself awake to puzzle things out further, but he really was tired…alright, exhausted and worn to be completely accurate. He briefly wondered if maybe they were right. He fell asleep, soundly.

He woke up at eight-thirty. Usually he was downstairs by seven, so he must have been tired. He took a quick shower and changed into clean clothes before wandering down to the dining room.

Bill was reading the paper and eating breakfast with Sirius and Kingsley. The living room door was open and Draco could see Charlie holding his nephew and Mrs. Weasley giving Fleur her breakfast.

"Draco, what are you doing up?" Bill asked.

"Am I not allowed now?" asked Draco, perhaps a little snidely.

Kingsley snorted.

"I meant it's a little early," said Bill.

"It's nine," said Draco.

"Precisely my point."

Draco rolled his eyes and pulled out a chair to sit. There was a pot of coffee on the table, but he skipped over it in favor of the carafe of hot water and Earl Grey tea leaves. He didn't like to drink coffee too many days in a row; addictions were prevalent in his family.

"There's breakfast on the stove," said Bill. "Want me to get you a plate?"

"I don't suppose you'll trust me to get my own?"

"Not really," said Bill, getting up, "besides, you need to take it easy."

Draco rolled his eyes yet again. He had a feeling the next few days would prove to be quite trying and the thought of returning to his apartment was attractive.

"Most kids your age would be ecstatic," said Kingsley.

"I'm not even going to begin to respond to that," said Draco.

The Auror shrugged. "Maybe you could try acting your age today."

"By age I assume you are referring to the social activities that the typical seventh year student engages in and I won't comment that physical age, in some medical opinions, does very little in the developmental processes. It is only through age-related expectations and a uniform schooling program that causes children of the same age to act similarly. While brain development does play a role, in this case, nurture wins over nature."

"You just did comment, though," said Sirius. "You said you weren't going to."

"Does no one appreciate the art of sarcasm?" asked Draco. "I am being forced to spend an entire day with you people. The least you can do is try to keep up."

Kingsley laughed and Sirius grinned. Draco scowled and Bill came back in with Draco's breakfast, the plate heaping with bacon, fried eggs, sausage, toast, and baked beans. He set it in front of Draco who frowned.

"I'm not eating all of this," he said.

"Try," said Bill.

"Do you have any concept of fat or cholesterol?"

"Are you watching your weight?"

"No."

"Then why do you care?"

"Because I'd rather not die at the age of twenty-five from a clogged artery."

"It's not going to kill you."

"You can't say that for certain."

"Everyone eats this for breakfast."

"Don't be ridiculous."

Draco watch Bill take in a breath and then release it.

"Fine, a fair amount of people eat eggs and sausage and toast for breakfast."

"And a fair amount of people die each year from unhealthy dieting."

"Draco," said Bill, very deliberately. "You. Are. Skinny. If anything, you could use a little fat. Eat your breakfast. All of it."

Draco looked down at his plate, wondering if it was even possible to put all of that into his stomach. He looked back up.

"I'll eat all of it if you let me work on a project today."

"How about this. You eat all your breakfast, and you take it easy today so you don't slip into another coma."

"It wasn't a coma."

"Draco, are you just being difficult because I actually care about your health?"

"There's caring and then there's paranoia."

Bill sighed and sat heavily in his chair. Draco sighed and picked up his fork. He didn't eat it all, but he ate a good bit of it. When he got up to leave, Bill ordered him away from his study and Draco didn't bother arguing. He didn't want to aggravate Bill because he figured if he didn't complain all that much, Bill would be much more receptive to letting him work tomorrow. Besides, he didn't need his study to work.

He did need his copy of Hogwarts: A Dark History.

After informing Bill, coolly, that he was being overly-protective and extremely trying, but without making too much of a fuss, he walked back upstairs to get his book. He was already paging through the book in his mind, and so he nearly walked straight into Ginny Weasley.

"Oh, sorry," he said, pulling up shortly and then staring.

She was coming from the bathroom. Her hair was wet, but still curling and it had darkened to an auburn, falling over her bare shoulders. She was just wearing a towel, wrapped around her chest and falling to upper-thigh. He looked away, but her image was already burned into memory.

"Sorry," he said again, trying to step around her, but she tried stepping out of his way as well and they ended up face-to-face again. He stepped to the other side, so did she. She laughed.

Draco stepped once more to the side, but this time she blocked him deliberately.

"Oh, come on," she said, obviously finding this situation humorous. "Don't be such a prude."

"What?" he asked, forcing himself to look over her shoulder.

"Like you've never seen a girl in a towel before. Stop acting like a sheltered second-year."

"I'm not acting like a second year."

"You're not looking at me."

"Do you want me to look at you while you're just in a towel?"

"You've seen naked women before. I don't see while you're trying to be all polite and gentlemanly."

Draco was confused and he turned his gaze to her face, trying to gauge her thoughts. Her hazel eyes were light, but also a little annoyed. That just confused him further.

"Alright, Weasley-,"

"Ginny."

"Ginny," he corrected. "I'm completely lost. Congratulations. Now can I please get by before your brothers' hex me for even being in the same house as you when you're just wearing a towel?"

"So that's why you're being polite?" she asked. "Because of my brothers?"

"Yes, whatever, does that satisfy?"

"No," she said.

He tried walking around her again, but she stepped in front of him. She took a step forward. He backed up and she frowned.

"What is it?"

"What is what?" he asked intelligently.

"What is your reasoning for acting like such a prude?"

Her question was loud. Ron had opened his door right at her exclamation and he was obviously going downstairs for breakfast. He stopped at his sister's question and frowned.

"What is going on here?" he asked.

"Draco's being a prude," said Ginny, crossing her arms. It tugged down the towel just a bit and Draco steadfastly looked to Ron.

"All I want to do is go to my room to get a book and your sister is going on about some nonsense I can't even begin to comprehend."

"Gin, why are you even talking to Malfoy in a towel?" asked Ron. "Go get some clothes on. You're indecent."

"Way to make it sound like I'm promiscuous. Really, I appreciate it," said Ginny.

"You're in a towel!" said Ron, absolutely scandalized. "There are men in this house!"

"It doesn't matter," said Ginny. "They're not even looking."

"And he shouldn't or I swear I will hex his eyes out."

"I'm not looking!" Draco protested. "I just want to get my book."

"Who's looking at what?" asked Fred, appearing in the hall from the stairs leading down from the third floor.

He was followed by George and they both froze when they saw their little sister in a towel in front of Draco. Of one accord they started forward.

"What is going in here?" Fred demanded.

"Malfoy, I swear, if you're doing anything inappropriate-," began George.

"We will not hesitate to curse your balls off," Fred finished.

"You people are insane," said Draco. "I am just trying to get my book from my room which is right there, down the hall."

"What are you doing with our sister?" asked George.

"She stopped me!"

"Ginny, get some clothes on for Merlin's sake," Ron pleaded.

"Well don't make it sound like I'm naked," said Ginny.

"Ginevra!"

Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. He was getting a headache.

"Can I get by or not?" he asked.

"What's stopping you?" asked George.

"She is," said Draco.

Wrong thing to say. The twins' eyes narrowed, taking on a very deadly look.

"No, not like that," said Draco, trying to amend his statement.

"Not like what exactly?" asked Fred.

"Fred, George, relax," said Ginny. "He's not being inappropriate. In fact, he's being annoyingly polite."

The twins looked as if they didn't believe her defense of Draco.

"Seriously," she insisted. "Apparently I'm not as attractive as I thought."

Fred and George frowned again.

"Did he say you were ugly?" asked Fred to Ginny.

"Did you say she was ugly?" asked George to Draco.

"What?" asked Draco. "No."

"Could have fooled me," said Ginny.

Draco stared at her, and then at the twins and then finally at Ron who looked just as confused as he did. He turned to Ginny.

"I did not say you were ugly."

"Not in so many words."

"How, in the name of Merlin, did you even jump to that conclusion?"

She shrugged. Damn, he wished she would stop doing that. Eyes are wired to be attracted to motion and he was finding it difficult enough keeping his eyes from roaming.

"Aren't you supposed to be a genius?" she asked. "You figure it out."

"Look here, ferret," said Fred. "You do not call-,"

"Or imply," said George.

"That our sister is ugly," Fred finished.

"I don't think she's ugly," said Draco.

"Then why does she think that you think she is?"

Draco turned to Ginny who was watching him with raised eyebrows.

"I don't think you're ugly," he said.

"But you don't think I'm pretty."

"I didn't say that."

"You just said I'm not ugly. That doesn't mean I'm good looking."

Draco took a breath and released it. "Fine," he said. "I think that you are pretty."

"Way to flatter a girl," said Ginny, brushing by him to walk to her room.

Fred and George both glared at him. He rolled his eyes and turned to the towel-clad girl.

"You are," he said. "You're a very attractive girl."

She stopped by her door and turned. "You really think so?" she asked innocently.

"Yes, really," he said.

She grinned. "Thanks."

She disappeared into her room and the door swung shut. Draco looked to the Weasley twins, but they were still glaring.

"You think our baby sister is attractive?" Fred asked.

"We'll be watching you, Malfoy," George warned.

The two walked down the hall, but not before purposefully knocking him aside. Draco stared after them before looking to Ron.

"What the hell was that?" Draco demanded, hoping that the Weasley would be able to explain it to him.

Ron raised his eyebrows. "Mate," he said, "my sister was totally playing you." He was half-impressed, half-disturbed.

Draco blinked. "She what?"

"Yeah," said Ron. He looked to Ginny's room and then back to Draco, looking completely disconcerted now. "I think she was flirting with you too."

Draco could feel his face go blank and he wondered if he was gaping.

"Yeah," said Ron, shifting about uncomfortably. "Well, I hafta…you know." He jerked his head towards the stairs and shuffled off.

Draco walked to his room and nearly yanked the door open. He stepped through, closed the door, and then leaned against it, trying to comprehend exactly what had just happened. Ginny Weasley was flirting with him?

Suddenly it all made sense, her teasing, always smiling at him, following him around. The only question he had was why?

Now that he thought about, she had been flirting with him all the way back in the school year, when she had asked him to the school dance, and that time when he had come back after meeting with Pansy. Shit, she had been flirting with him when he had been with Pansy. For some reason, the thought was discomfiting and he was slightly embarrassed.

'But why should he be?' he argued with himself. It wasn't as if he liked her, now did he?

He waited for the denial to rise up in mind, but it didn't. He felt chilled at the lack of a negative answer, suddenly overwhelmed and apprehensive. He slid down the door until he was sitting on the floor with the alarming knowledge that he might be interested in none other than Ginevra Weasley.

"This is ridiculous," he said softly, the words coming out 'Ceci est ridicule.' because he had a habit of lapsing back into French when he was stressed.

He did not fall for her sort of girl. He was a Slytherin. He was cold, he was aloof, he was logical. Why then, was Ginny Weasley so attractive?

Of course, that was it. She was just a pretty girl and he was a teenaged boy; that was it. He was going through a stressful time, which put him on edge, and he was confusing the strain for sexual tension. She used to like, still might like, Harry Potter. Maybe she was flirting with him just because she needed a distraction. Yes, that was it.

He ignored the fact that his stomach twisted when he thought of Ginny with Harry.

He let out a breath and stood up, finding his book in his trunk and then leaving his room. He wondered if it was just a cruelty on Fate's part that Ginny stepped out of her room at the same time. He had a suspicion she was waiting for him.

She smiled at him.

"See, I'm dressed now," she said. "You don't have to avert your eyes this time."

Draco ignored her and just walked to the stairs. She followed him.

"What are you reading?" she asked.

"Do you really care?" he asked, his voice coming out far too wearily for his liking.

"Yes."

He rolled his eyes, but she couldn't see him. "A book."

He could picture her own eye roll. He then felt her hands on his shoulder, trying to peer over him to see the book. He stopped and turned around on the stairs. She was one step above him and so they were eye-to-eye.

"Weasley, stop it," he said, completely seriously.

"Stop what?" she asked, frowning slightly but also becoming sober.

"Stop flirting with me."

He could see that he had taken her aback. She frowned further, her brows knitting and her eyes darkening.

"Why?" she finally asked.

"Why?" he reiterated. "Because it's annoying and distracting. I don't like you and you don't like me, so just lay off. I get that you're bored, and I can understand that, but it's getting old so just stop, alright?"

"You think that I'm flirting because I'm bored, or because I can't flirt with Harry anymore so I'm using you as a substitute, is that it?" she asked. She was surprisingly perceptive.

"Exactly," said Draco.

She laughed at him. "I was over Harry last year. Completely over him."

"So find something to amuse yourself and stop using me."

"You honestly think that I'm just bored," said Ginny. "Huh, I thought you would have given yourself more credit."

"I know that girls flirt with me," said Draco. "But not girls like you."

"Girls like me."

"Good girls," he clarified. "Gryffindors and Dumbledore lovers and all that."

"So we're just not attracted to you?"

"You understand that I'm not the type to pursue a relationship with, and I know I'm not."

"That's awfully stereotypical of you."

"Most stereotypes are based on truths."

"Well, you're wrong."

"About stereotypes?"

"Yes, and about me flirting with you because I'm bored."

"Well why else would you?"

"You really don't get it, do you?" she asked.

"Get what?"

She smiled and shrugged. "I'm not that much of a good girl."

He understood that and he stared. Was she honestly admitting that she was flirting with him because she liked him?

She smiled at his stunned expression and walked by him. He turned as well.

"Believe me, Weasley, you are," he called after her, trying to convince her that she really didn't like him.

She turned around and laughed at him, before disappearing into the dining room. Draco didn't follow.

Bill honestly tried to keep Draco, if not happy, at least entertained during the day, but Draco was refusing to participate in anything that he suggested. He spent the majority of the day in the drawing room, where the rest of the teens were, but instead of participating in their games or conversations, he simply sat on the sofa and read Hogwarts: A Dark History.

Bill couldn't exactly accuse him of doing any work because he was re-reading a tome he probably had memorized, but still, taking it easy to Bill meant hanging around the house with people, and not glaring every time someone interrupted his reading. He had to admit, though, that he wasn't a teenaged genius, and so maybe this was Draco's way of laying back.

It wasn't until dinner that he realized what Draco was actually doing.

He had gone up to the third floor drawing room to collect the teens for dinner. The Gryffindor students were finishing a heated game of Exploding-Snap and so Bill wandered over to where Draco was sitting on the couch, still reading.

"Hungry?" he asked conversationally.

Draco didn't answer and Bill assumed he was getting the silent treatment. He suppressed a groan of frustration and plucked the book from Draco's hands. The boy looked up, startled.

"Dinner," said Bill, jerking his head to the door.

"Come on, Draco," said Harry, getting up from the table. "It has to be more interesting than the novel, huh?"

"I wouldn't bet on it," said Draco, but he followed the teens out and Bill looked down at the book in his hands. It was still open and so he flipped it over, wondering what Draco was reading about. He should have known not to trust a Slytherin.

The chapter detailed the founders of Hogwarts and the page Draco was on was specifically dedicated the artifacts left by each and the legend surrounding them. The top of the page was folded down and Bill flipped through the book, finding several other sections that were marked as well, all of them mentioning Hufflepuff's cup.

Bill swore. Draco wasn't resting; he was trying to find Voldemort's Horcrux. He hadn't been giving Bill the silent treatment, he had been so involved in the book he hadn't registered Bill's presence. Bill marched down the stairs, finding the family at the table, passing dishes.

"Draco," he said, getting everyone's attention, but he didn't care. "What is this?" He held up the book.

Draco's eyes flickered from his face to the pages and then back again.

"I was reading," he said, shrugging.

"You weren't bloody reading," said Bill. "You were reading about the Horcrux! You were trying to track it, weren't you?"

For a moment he wondered if Draco wasn't going to answer but then the boy shrugged again.

"Somebody had too," he said.

"Unbelievable," said Bill. "You pass out from exhaustion and you go right back to working. Do you care at all if you slip into a real coma this time?"

Draco didn't answer. He took a sip of his pumpkin juice.

"Damn it, Draco. I have a right to be worried and this isn't helping!" said Bill, dropping the book onto the table in front of him.

"I was just looking into it, that was all."

"I told you to take it easy today. I told you no working."

"And you're not my mother."

"You're right," said Bill. "I'm not. I actually give a shit about what happens to you."

He suddenly realized how that sounded and he mentally braced himself, but Draco seemed to understand the point he was trying to make because he flinched, but let the comment slide.

"Bill, I'm seventeen. I can take care of myself. You and everyone else are just overreacting."

"No, we're not," said Bill.

"You can't just expect that I'm going to be able to drop everything I'm working on. I can't just…sit around and do nothing."

"You haven't even tried."

"I nearly went insane today just reading."

"And tomorrow you won't even be doing that. I meant what I said. You need to recuperate."

"You're being ridiculous."

"I'm worried."

"Get over it."

Bill stared. "Get over it?" he asked. "Draco, you can't expect me to let you work yourself to death. I'm sorry if that frustrates you, but I want you to take tomorrow off, and the next day as well if you have to."

"Absolutely not."

"That wasn't a request."

"Fine," said Draco. He got up from the table.

"Where are you going?" asked Bill.

"I'm leaving," said Draco. "What did you think?"

"You can't just walk out."

"I'm going to."

"Draco, you're sick."

"I am not sick!" Draco exclaimed. "Nor am I overworking myself. Yes, something happened last night but I would know if I was in danger of overexerting myself."

"Like you knew a month ago? When Severus had to drug you?"

"That was different. I was under a time constraint."

"So you don't feel any pressure then? Trying to find Voldemort's Horcrux first?"

Draco hesitated.

"Exactly my point," said Bill. "We have people working on the cup. You are going to give it a rest."

"Let me work on something else then."

Bill groaned in exasperation. "You don't get it, do you?"

"Because you're not making any sense! I don't need you to save me from myself."

"That hasn't always been true," said Bill.

Draco glared. "I'm leaving."

"No, you're not," said Bill.

"You can't stop me."

"I'll get Pomfrey to sign a medical paper."

"You wouldn't."

"Don't try me."

"Well then I'll see you in court, won't I?"

Draco spun around on his heel, heading to the stairs. Bill groaned again.

"Draco. Draco!"

Draco turned, his expression still set.

"Merde, Bill," he said, his hands clenched. "Je suis adulte, pas votre enfant. J'ai un appartement, se rappeler? Ceci était juste une expérience, une expérience folle, et il n'a pas travaillé. Il y a trop ici, trop de bruit, trop de gens. Je ne peux pas vous tous faire face à ; j'ai besoin de mon travail pour me garder sain d'esprit.

It took a Bill a second to realize that Draco had lapsed into French, something which only happened when the boy was entirely upset. Bill had married a French woman though so he could translate. I am an adult, not your child. I have an apartment, remember? This was just an experiment, a crazy experiment, and it didn't work. There's too much here, too much noise, too many people. I can't cope with all of you; I need my work to keep me sane.

"Je suis désolé, mais cela est comment il travaille. Cela est comment je travaille," Draco finished. I'm sorry, but that is how it works. That's how I work.

Draco stared at him, as if wondering if he would understand.

"Je comprends," said Bill, affirming that he did.

Draco frowned, as if wondering why he was speaking French, but then he must have guessed the answer.

"Merde," he muttered again, his hand rising to run through his hair even as his cheeks turned a decided shade of pink.

Bill gave him a quick smile. "We'll figure something out, alright? Not the Horcrux, just yet, but we'll work through it."

Draco let out a breath but nodded. "Alright."

The French is taken from a website, so I'm sorry if it's inaccurate. There's much more D/G on the way, so get excited (and leave a review, please and thank you)!





9. Kisses

Disclaimer: Ummm, yeah right.

A/N: So, thank you so much for all of the French translations I received. I will be fixing my horrid attempt at French….tomorrow. I'm already an hour over the deadline (meaning it's one in the morning) and I still have some homework to do for tomorrow's classes. So, farewell, I hope you like it.

"Mail," said Kingsley as Draco came down for breakfast.

Draco took the letter and sat at the table, helping himself to cereal and yogurt and then making a cup of tea. Once it was fixed he opened the envelope.

The letter was from Laney and Sam, discussing Christmas plans and telling him about their new home. Draco skimmed it once for bad news, but finding none, he went back and read it more carefully.

Sirius was reading his own letter and Kingsley had the paper. Draco only took note of the other men when Sirius set the letter down and Draco caught a glimpse of a round script in a dark blue ink. The same that was on his message.

"Why is my aunt writing to you?" he asked, his voice going cold.

Sirius looked up, looked back at his letter, and flushed. Kingsley put his paper down, raising his eyebrows as he settled in for a fight.

"She was, uh, she was just…asking how you were," said Sirius.

"Asking how I was," said Draco.

"Yes," said Sirius. He ran a hand through his hair. "Alright, so that was just a part of it. A tiny part. We may have…hit it off while you were in the hospital."

Draco raised an eyebrow as he filtered in that information.

"Black," he said. "I realize that you are a grown man and that my aunt is a grown woman, but I swear if you hurt her, I will kill you, slowly and painfully, and they won't find your body for several years."

Sirius nodded hurriedly. Draco turned back to his breakfast, but he saw Sirius look to Kingsley out of the corner of his eye.

"Now you know who killed me, should I ever disappear."

"I doubt we could prove anything," said Kingsley.

Draco smirked and finished his breakfast.

Bill came in when he was about done. Draco was relieved that Bill seemed to recognize the fact that Draco was an adult now because he only asked if Draco had slept well and accepted his answer.

"I get it from my mother," said Bill a while later, when they were bent over the Persian Runes in Draco's study.

Draco raised an eyebrow.

"The whole worrying thing," said Bill. "I'm also an older sibling and a new father. I deserve to be forgiven for being overly concerned."

Draco snorted. "I'm a Malfoy. I don't forgive."

Bill rolled his eyes. "Arrogant snot."

"Yes," Draco agreed.

Bill chucked his quill at him and Draco's lips twitched.

There was a knock on the door and then it opened. Harry stepped in.

"I'm not interrupting, am I?"

"Completely lost my train of thought," said Draco.

"I'm sorry," said Harry. "I can come back in-,"

Draco rolled his eyes. "Sarcasm, Potter. Learn it."

"Oh," said Harry. He came in further and held out a journal. "This is for you."

Draco looked at the book. "Why are you giving me your diary?"

"It's not," said Harry, putting it down on the table when Draco wouldn't take it.

"Then what is it?"

"You know," said Bill. "You could just open it and find out and not give Harry such a hard time."

"Where's the fun in that?" asked Draco, but he flipped open the cover.

There was a list of words on the left. One the right was a list of nonsense syllables with an inordinate amount of 's's.

"They're spelled phonetically," said Harry. "If you point your wand at a word, you can hear it."

Draco flipped through the pages, finding that there were sentences in the back.

"Potter, you do realize that no one has successfully learned Parseltongue?"

"Is that going to stop you from trying?" asked Harry.

"Not at all," said Draco. "But why-?"

"For getting Sirius back," said Harry. "I told you I was going to say 'thank you' in a way that you couldn't refuse, so there it is."

Draco looked up at the boy hero. "You're welcome," he said. "Hermione helped you on this, didn't she?"

"How'd you know?" asked Harry.

"You said 'phonetically'."

"She showed be how to set the charms," Harry affirmed. "Have fun with it, and let me know if you need any help."

He gave a quick smile in parting and left. Draco turned to the first page of journal, wondering exactly how the combination of 'slres' was possible. He read down the list.

"Should we call it quits on the runes today and let you play with your new toy?" asked Bill.

"We can keep going," said Draco, reluctant to put the book away, but not wanting to throw Bill out. He skimmed over the rest of the list as he shut the book, committing their spellings to memory.

Bill laughed. "You work on your Parseltongue, Draco. Besides, I should go rescue Fleur from Lukas. He's been a little cranky lately."

"He was born a few days ago. How is that lately?"

"Don't get technical on me," said Bill. "Else I'll make you baby-sit one day." He got up from the table. "Lunch is a twelve. Will I have to fetch you?"

"I'll be there," said Draco.

"Holding you to that," said Bill, and then he left.

Draco did go to lunch, a small affair because most of the teens left to go Christmas shopping, but as soon as he was done he went straight back to his study. The snake-speak was difficult, relying mostly on sounds that involved movement of the tongue. The lack of lip-movement was frustrating as well and Draco had a hard time stopping himself from enunciating by rounding his lips. Still, he was determined to succeed and spent most of the afternoon on the first page.

The door opened sometime before dinner and Ginny stepped in, much to his annoyance. Then he saw what she was wearing, a low-cut, forest green tank top. Her pink bra straps were clearly visible and Draco had to force himself to look down.

"Can you leave?" he asked.

"I could," she said.

"Will you?"

"Probably not."

"Why not?"

She smiled at him. "Don't play coy, Draco. It doesn't suit you."

She was obviously referring to their little chat on the stairs. Draco decided to attack the subject head on.

"Weasley, I don't care if you think you have some absurd liking for me, nothing is going to happen. You are wasting your time. Go find someone else to bother."

She tilted her head to the side, causing her loose hair to tumble over her bare shoulders. He clenched his jaw.

"Are you really not that interested?" she asked.

"Yes," said Draco, a tad too quickly.

"Liar," she said, her smile growing.

Draco swore under his breath, his fingers reverting to their 1-3-2-4 pattern. How to deal with a love-struck Weasley?

"It doesn't matter if I'm interested or not," he argued.

"How does it not matter?"

"Because this…," he searched for a word, gave up, and just gestured between them, "is ridiculous."

"I like you," said Ginny. "You are interested in me. How is that ridiculous?"

"Because you're a bloody Weasley."

"Oh, I forgot," said Ginny. "I'm a 'good girl'. I can't possibly like you." She rolled her eyes. "Please, Draco, you're not as 'bad boy' as you would like to think. You're part of the Order now and you've saved nearly half of my family, including me. I fail to see how that puts you in such an unattainable category."

"I'm not talking about political views," said Draco. "I'm talking character flaws. I don't date your type of girl. I date girls who drink underage, who wear too-tight clothes, who don't have a problem with having sex after the first date, and who are going to be gone in two weeks or less. How does that make us compatible?"

"You can't honestly tell me that you want to continue dating that type of girl," said Ginny.

"Why not?" asked Draco.

"Because I don't think you like the idea of having your ex-girlfriends going out and sleeping with half a dozen other guys. I think you want to have a relationship where a girl is committed to you and where you are committed to her."

"How do you come to that conclusion?" asked Draco.

"Because you seem like the possessive type."

"I'm not possessive."

"Probably not, but that doesn't mean you wouldn't be if you had less self-control. I'm assuming it has to do with growing up as a Malfoy. I know about your mother; Blaise told me."

"Did he now?" asked Draco, raising an eyebrow. He would have to remember to speak to the black-haired boy; a few threats should put him back into place.

"He also told me about your father, and that he won't get a divorce."

"This conversation is over," said Draco, closing the Parseltongue journal with a snap and standing to leave. Ginny blocked him. He was taller than her, and his line of sight included a vantage point down her tank-top. He looked her in the eyes.

"Move."

"No," said Ginny. "Why won't you date me?"

"You know why. There are a thousand reasons not and you know them all, but most of all, because you don't want to get involved with me."

"Would you stop telling me what I do and don't want?" Ginny demanded. "I am not a child who does not know her own mind. I am quite aware what dating you would entail, don't insult me by assuming that I do not know the consequences."

"You're dismissing the consequences without even thinking of them. You're a silly little girl who still believes in romantic nonsense."

"Since when is romance nonsense?"

"Since you think that you want to date me."

"Why are you being so hard on yourself?"

"Because you are only seeing the Draco Malfoy who decided to defect from the Dark Lord. I'm still a Slytherin; I'm still a Malfoy."

"I know that."

"No, Ginny," he said. "You don't and you honestly don't know what you would be getting yourself into by dating me. Do us both a favor and forget that we even had this conversation."

He tried to step by her but she blocked his way, a hand on his chest. He looked down, not knowing she would be so daring.

"You don't think I can handle you?" she asked, her voice incredulous.

"I'm trying to save your Gryffindor virtue. Be grateful."

Her eyes practically sparked and she stepped up close. Her cheeks were flushed and her lips parted. He tried so hard not to look at her mouth, not to look towards the décolleté green tank and the soft ivory skin it exposed. She noticed his struggle.

"Stop looking for excuses," she said, her voice a whisper, almost husky.

She didn't get it. She didn't understand that men like him would look at her and plunge right ahead. He was a Malfoy and he knew the art of seduction. He could sway a girl from unwilling to pulling her own clothes off. He would never do that to Ginny, of course, but he only had so much control. He didn't know if he could exercise that control, and that was what really scared him.

The idea that one girl could make him fear for his self-control was terrifying. Draco knew what he could and could not handle. If he did get to that point, to the point where Ginny could snap that control, she would have far too much power over him. Look at Lucius; he couldn't live like that.

Besides, he was doing her a favor, warning her away. She was a Weasley and needed a fellow Gryffindor. He immediately banished the thought. She was too quick for a housemate and had a few too many Slytherin tendencies. Ravenclaw would suit her well.

He looked down at her.

"I really am trying to help you," he said.

She bit her lower lip, sending him a small smile that nearly broke his resolve.

"Damn it, Weasley," he muttered under his breath, but she heard.

"Do you want to kiss me?" she asked, tilting her head up to him.

"No." He only just managed the word without his voice catching.

"Liar."

"You just don't get it," he forced out.

"Show me then," she said.

He told himself he was showing her just to make her understand. He wasn't going to enjoy this at all. He lied.

"Fine," he half-snarled.

He grabbed her shoulders and pulled her closer, dropping his mouth onto hers and delving past her surprised, open lips. Merlin, her lips were soft. She was startled, frozen, for a second, but then she returned the kiss, moving against him, and it was too much, too intimate. He needed her to understand, not indulge himself.

He angled away from her mouth and she gave a small groan of protest, but then he kissed his way down her neck and her head dropped back. She melted in his arms, only held upright because she was clutching onto his shirt and because his arms snaked around her back, pressing her even further into him.

All women had erogenous zones on their necks. Draco had yet to find one who didn't and he discovered Ginny's towards the base of her neck, right where a vampire would feed. She gasped when he lightly sucked at the skin there. He ran his hands along her arms, making her shiver, tremble against him, lips parted, reddened from his kiss. He wanted to taste her lips again; he didn't let himself.

"Want me to stop?" he asked, lips still against her neck, hands running up her bare shoulders and burying his fingers in her hair, massaging her head, hitting all of the right pressure points.

"Mmhh?" she asked, her voice breathy.

He turned his attention to the rest of her neck, sucking his way up to her jaw, but not hard enough to leave a mark.

"Do you want me to stop?" he asked again, in between kisses.

"No, don't," she said.

He sucked at that spot on the other side of her neck, keeping her completely distracted as his fingers trailed from her head, to her bare back, to the top of her tank that just barely covered the back fastener on her bra. He trailed his mouth down to her collarbone and she arched against him. It was too easy to unclasp her bra.

"You sure?" he asked, ghosting his fingers up her arms. She shivered again and he returned his lips to her neck, biting lightly and her gasp was actually voice.

"Ginny," he said, now moving his lips to tug at her ear. "Are you sure?"

"Yes!" she gasped as he licked the outer shell of her ear before tugging again at her earlobe.

He found the silky bra straps on her shoulders and slowly slid them down her arms. He walked her backwards to the wall, bending her elbows by grabbing at her hands. He kissed her on the mouth this time, but only so he could pull the straps over her bent arms. He slipped a hand around her waist, trying not to notice how smooth her skin was, or the heat that radiated off her, and slipped it under her tank. He let his fingers dance along her spine, ground his hips against hers, and deepened the kiss, running his tongue along hers before sucking on her lower lip. With his free hand, he pulled her bra completely out from her shirt. He wondered how badly he was going to hate himself.

"Do you want to stop?" he asked, stepping back but keeping her against the wall.

"Why do you keep asking?"

He smirked, cruelly. "Because if I had known how easy you were going to be, I would have dated you back in school."

He held up her bra and she stared at it for a moment before flushing, looking down at her shirt and crossing her arms over her chest. He had already seen though. Her tank was thin; the outline of her breasts was perfectly clear and he remembered everything he saw. She was gorgeous; he wished he hadn't looked.

He raised an eyebrow at her as she went from mortified to angry.

"How dare you," she said.

"I asked if you wanted to stop, Weasley. Don't blame this one on me."

She opened her mouth, closed it, and then blinked. She blinked again, clenching her jaw, and, to his horror, tears caught in her lashes. He had made her cry.

"Do you get it now?" he asked, twisting his voice into a cold, mocking tone.

She didn't answer. Draco wondered if she was even hearing him because she wasn't looking him in the face, but staring at the floor, arms still across her chest and still blinking away tears. She swallowed hard.

"Can I have my bra, please?" she asked. Her voice didn't tremble, but her words were soft.

He tossed the pink undergarment at her, but she wasn't looking his way. It hit the wood floor and lay there.

"Get yourself dressed before you leave," he said, his voice still cruel. He grabbed his papers and left quickly, shutting the door behind him. He went straight for the stairs, grateful that no one appeared to be around. He almost ran into his room and shut his door quietly. He locked it with every charm he could think of and then sank down on the floor, hating himself and getting angry with the fact that he felt so guilty.

He spent the hour until dinner in self-revulsion. He tried to stop it, tried to concentrate on the journal, but ended up sitting on the floor and staring at the wall while his fingers tapped out their pattern.

He went down to dinner, only because he had to pretend that nothing had happened. Ginny wasn't there. She told her mother she wasn't feeling well.

Draco went back to his study after dinner, staring at the spot where he had backed her against the wall before turning back to his work. He was protecting her, and sometimes the lessons had to hurt.

He memorized the next four pages of spelling, only interrupted when Bill reminded him to get some sleep that night. He nodded and spent the next two hours listening to the varied pronunciations of 'slusc' and 'sluss'.

The door opened and he looked up, startled to see Ginny in the doorway. She had changed out of her tank top and into a t-shirt that clung in all the right places. Hadn't he scared her off?

"What are you?" he asked. "Incredibly dense or did you just decide that you do want a quick shag? I'm sorry, but I don't screw Weasleys."

Ginny was not daunted. "Oh, come off it. Don't think I haven't realized what you were doing. You're not going to scare me off."

"You looked pretty scared earlier today," said Draco, looking back down at his work.

Ginny stepped forward. "That doesn't mean you weren't as well."

Draco turned his eyes heavenward, pretending that she hadn't hit close to the mark. He took a breath and slowly released it, like he was trying to remain patient when, in all actuality, he didn't know what to say.

"Look, Weasley," he said, staring her directly in the eyes. "I've made it perfectly clear that a relationship between us is absurd and that you really don't want to date a guy like me, so can you please give it a rest?"

"And I've told you to stop deciding for me. You don't know what I'm thinking, or what I'm feeling, so don't presume to have my every answer. The fact is you did a good job of scaring me off, congratulations, but I never stay scared for long."

She should stay scared. Damn girl had no common sense. He glared.

"Do you have a point?"

"Yes," said Ginny. "I was getting there."

"Then get there. I don't have all night."

"Fine," said Ginny. "You pushed me away."

Draco furrowed his brows, as if confused. "I what?"

"You made sure that I wasn't going to push the point of dating you anymore. Why?"

"Hmm. That's a tough one. Maybe it's because I don't want to date you? Did you ever think of that?"

"Then why did you kiss me?"

Because she was driving him insane, that's why.

"Maybe you missed the entire object lesson," he said. "Dating guys like me will only end one way: you get in over your head and do things you don't necessarily want to do."

"Please," said Ginny. "If you really weren't interested you would have found another way to tell me. Heck, you would have told Bill to keep me away, but you didn't."

"You're reading far too much in the matter. I didn't tell Bill because I thought you would get the hint."

"You went to the dance with me."

"Because you wouldn't let me say no!"

"But you could have said no. And you think I'm attractive."

Draco rolled his eyes. "Yes, I think you're attractive. You know what, Granger isn't half-bad to look at. Doesn't mean I like her."

"But you aren't attracted to her. Attractive connotes an attraction of some sort."

"It also doesn't mean I like you."

"But you do," said Ginny. "Admit it."

"I refuse to have this conversation with you."

Draco got to his feet, wanting to leave the room. Ginny stopped him.

"The last time you did that, things didn't exactly end well," said Draco. His voice was cool.

"I'm wearing a front-clasp this time, so don't even try," said Ginny, smiling a bit. "I know what you were thinking when you kissed me."

"No, you really don't," said Draco.

"Fine, tell me how close I am then. I don't believe for one minute that you are a guy who would lose control. I also don't believe that you would seduce me."

"Lis-," Draco started, but Ginny raised a hand to his mouth and his eyebrows rose fractionally, trying to ignore the soft pads of her fingertips on his lips.

"You are cruel, on occasion. You are caustic and sarcastic, but you are not sadistic. You would never push a woman into sex and I know this because all the girls you have dated have been girls who are looking for a sexual encounter. You would not intentionally seduce a girl against her will, and you can't even begin to deny that."

"Fine," Draco started, but Ginny stopped him again.

"You also wouldn't lose control. Yes, you are a guy, but I doubt that you would ever let yourself get past the point of stopping unless you and the girl were both ready. You have incredible self-control; after all, you did break your addiction."

Draco pushed her hand away from his mouth. "Only because your brother locked me in a room."

"But you asked for help," said Ginny. "You're not fooling me."

"You don't have me figured out, Weasley. You want to believe that I think that way."

"But don't you?" asked Ginny. "That's why you tried to make me leave. You're afraid of losing control, aren't you?"

"No," said Draco.

"You are afraid of giving me that sort of power over you, that I could make you lose control."

"No."

"Mostly, you're just afraid of trust in general."

Draco shook his head.

"You are afraid that getting yourself into a relationship is just going to leave you vulnerable. You are afraid that I might hurt you, or leave, or even cheat on you."

Draco flinched.

"Draco, you can't go through life thinking that every one is going to leave, that no one really cares, that everyone is just looking out for themselves and they will betray you if the opportunity arises."

"I don't think that."

"Look me in the eye," said Ginny. "Look me in the eye and tell me that you are not terrified of getting in a relationship because you don't want to give anyone the power to hurt you. If you just stay in your study with your books and your facts and your genius, then you won't care for anyone and so nothing they can say can be harmful, nothing they can do will bring pain."

He didn't want to look in her eyes, but she stepped closer and he made the mistake of glancing at her. She had hazel eyes, but unlike Bill's, she had a bit more brown and they were a few shades darker. She had a certain darkness in her eyes as well, but at the moment it was completely swept aside.

"I'm a Gryffindor, Draco, and a Weasley. I don't cheat and I won't leave. I may hurt you if I get angry, because we all have a bad temper, but I will always apologize, and I will always make it better. If you ever want to have a relationship, a serious one, you are going to have to learn to trust. Who better to learn with?"

Draco shook his head. "No."

"Don't back out now," she said, stepping closer. He took a step back, hit the wall, and let his hands press against the surface, wishing the wall would just disappear, that he could fall through, anything to get away. She already knew too much. He was…damn it, he was terrified.

"Tell me that I was wrong," she challenged.

He couldn't, not fixed under her gaze. Even if he managed to lie, it would be blatantly obvious, to her and himself.

"Tell me that you aren't scared."

How could she read him like that?

She tilted her face up. "I want to kiss you," she said, her breath wafting across his lips.

"You don't," he said.

"No, I really do," she said, smiling. "Tell me that you don't want me to kiss you."

He didn't want her to kiss him. He didn't want her to kiss him.

"Tell me you don't want it," she said again.

He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He swallowed hard, glad that he was against the wall because his grip on the world was slipping.

She stepped closer so they were only two inches apart and stood on her tiptoes. Her hands reached out, not hesitating in the slightest, and ran through his hair before tipping his head down. Her lips met his, neither of them moving for a moment, and then she released the pressure, tipping her head to the other side and kissing his lips again. His lips latched onto hers of their own accord, the kiss open now, but gentle, soft. She tasted sweet. His tongue ran over her lips, memorizing the feel of them before venturing further and find hers, brushing against it.

He wanted to pull her closer, to bury his hands in her hair. His left hand reached out, but stopped before he could touch her. He couldn't touch her because then he would be lost and so he just devoured every bit of her mouth, returning his hands to the wall but now they were curled into fists, nails biting his skin to try and keep him conscious. He could see her freckled cheek and a strand of red hair that glinted gold. She kissed with her eyes closed.

She pulled back, but he followed, bending his neck and shoulders away from the wall, not aware that she was ending the kiss until her hands pressed him back. He blinked; she smiled quietly with reddened lips.

"See?" she asked.

She was referring to everything, he knew that. She wanted him to see that it wouldn't be bad, that he could trust her, that he wanted to be with her. He saw it all, but didn't know if he could trust. He did know that he wanted to be with her and the realization sent a wave of panic through his mind. He let his head drop against the wall as the world seemed to spin. It was too much.

"I-," he started, but then he stopped because his voice caught and he didn't know what else to say. Yes? No? Kill me now, it's less painful?

He pushed off the wall, knowing that his face was clearly portraying everything he felt inside but he could do nothing to stop it. She stepped back and let him leave, let him run for the door, for that he was grateful, and then he was running up the stairs and in his room. Once again, the wards went up and he fell face first on his bed. His arm grabbed a pillow and pulled it to his face.

His throat was closing up and his eyes stung. He swore into the pillow, eyes squeezed shut and every muscle tensed. He fell asleep that way.

Sometime close to midnight, Bill got up to make sure Draco was actually going to get to bed. The study light was on, and the door open a crack. He sighed and started down the hall, intending on sending the boy to his room. Voices caught his attention, one being Draco's more cold tones, and the other belonging to his sister.

Bill ventured closer and peeked through the crack, seeing Ginny confronting Draco. He knew that eavesdroppers rarely heard things they wanted to hear, but curiosity had him stay. What he heard, and saw, caused him to freeze at the door.

Ginny was talking about Draco kissing her and eluding to something else that had happened.

What the hell had happened?

Draco was trying to convince Ginny that she didn't want to date him.

Since when did Ginny like Draco?

He could tell, by watching the Slytherin, that Draco wasn't so sure he didn't like Ginny. He could see it in the tensed posture and the faint flickers of panic in his eyes.

Ginny had Draco pretty well figured out, and she was blunt, incredibly so. Draco couldn't argue with her even though he tried. Bill wondered how much it was because Draco actually did like his sister.

Draco Malfoy liked his sister?

Oh Merlin, he wished he hadn't stayed at the door, but he couldn't leave now. He had to know what was going on because so help him, if Draco had touched his sister in anyway, the boy was going to be in for it. No one hurt his little sister, no one touched his little sister, without prior approval from her older brothers or parents.

And then Ginny had to step up close to Draco. She had to say, "I want to kiss you."

No, Ginny did not kiss boys that had not been subjected to the 'appropriate boyfriend test'.

He watched as Draco stepped back, and Bill thought hard at his sister 'Don't you dare!' but telepathy is a myth, even in the wizarding world.

Ginny kissed him. Ginny kissed Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy kissed back.

Bill was not seeing this.

His sister stepped back and Draco tried to follow, but Ginny pushed him back.

"See?" she said.

Bill suddenly wondered if he got it wrong. Perhaps he should be more worried about Draco, because the kid was pale, his fists clenched. A myriad of emotions crossed the usually guarded face and the usually guarded eyes were clear, burning mercury.

Draco started to say something, his voice caught, and then he was striding to the door. Bill stepped back. The door swung open, hiding him, and he could hear Draco rush for the stairs, running up the steps. He had a faint sense of déjà vu. The last time he had heard Draco's running footsteps was when they had fought in Draco's sixth year, when Bill had sent him running out of the room with harsh words. The memory was still shameful.

Bill stepped around the door. Ginny was letting out a breath, hands pushing her hair back, and she whirled when he came in. Bill shut the door and turned to his sister.

"Ginny, we have to talk," he said.

"You saw?"

"I did."

She colored, dropped her hands, and sighed.

"Are you going to give me the 'he's not the right boy for you' speech?"

"Actually, no," said Bill.

"The 'I don't approve but I'm not going to stop you' speech?"

"Again, no."

"The only one left is 'don't get your heart broken', and you've always trusted me to know my own emotions. Mum gives me that one."

"I'm putting a twist on it," said Bill. "Don't break his."

Ginny looked at him, searching the gravity in his eyes.

"Gin," said Bill. "Draco's not…I don't think he's ready for a relationship just yet. I don't want you to help him and invest in him, only to decide that it's a drag dating an emotionally unavailable teen genius five months down the road and break up with him. Other boys could take that, but Draco isn't other boys. I don't want to see that happen."

"It won't," said Ginny. "You know that."

"I do," said Bill. "I just want to be sure."

"Does this mean I have your blessing?"

"I'm not done," said Bill. "I want you to be careful as well. Draco isn't the safest of people, and his father is Lucius Malfoy."

Ginny knew he was referring to the diary. He watched as her eyes darkened the way they always did when she thought of that year.

"I know," she said quietly.

"He doesn't know," said Bill.

"And he isn't going to know," said Ginny, looking up, determination driving the dark away.

"He's going to find out."

"Not if we don't tell him."

"Are you sure?"

"He cares for his father," said Ginny. "If he does…come to care for me and then he found out, what would he do?"

"He wouldn't leave, if that's what you were thinking."

"I know he wouldn't. But if he did grow to like me, what would he do to Lucius?"

Bill didn't know what to say. Ginny yawned.

"He's the boy trouble, isn't he?" he asked. "The one you talked about when we were in the hospital for Ron."

"He is," said Ginny.

It was a comfort to know she hadn't just started liking Draco.

Ginny yawned again and stretched.

"Well, I'm off to bed. I have a big day tomorrow."

"What's tomorrow?" asked Bill, wondering if he really wanted the answer.

Ginny smiled. "I'm going to ask Draco out."

There may be lots of typos because I didn't edit very well (homework and all that). Please leave a review and make my day!





10. Dating Difficulties

Disclaimer: If I owned Harry Potter, I would eat expensive chocolate every day. I don't own Harry Potter, and I'm thinking it might be for the best in this case.

Author's Note: So, I'm not updating next week, as I've explained to some, due to fall break and the gradual burn-out of this writer. Thanks for your understanding, and to show my appreciation, this is a longer chapter than usual. Yay!

Draco did not sleep well. Thoughts of a certain Ginevra Weasley plagued his mind, and no matter what he did, he couldn't shut her out. He was afraid to sleep because if he was having this much trouble with his conscious mind, who knows what his subconscious would do.

Still, a hot shower had the circles fading from under his eyes and he made sure to comb his hair neatly and then dressed in a pair of black trousers and a light-blue oxford. Once he was satisfied that the clothes would detract from his pale complexion, he walked downstairs.

To his surprise, Dumbledore was sitting in the kitchen with Sirius, Kingsley, Snape, and Lupin.

"Ah, Draco," said the Headmaster, smiling at him. "I was hoping you would be awake. Remus has just gotten back from Prague and he has some interesting news to share."

Draco pulled out a chair next to Snape and sat. Bill walked in from the kitchen holding a pot of coffee, which he set in front of Kingsley. He gave Draco a quick smile, but for some reason it seemed forced. Draco chalked it up to stress from the baby. He turned to Lupin.

"Prague," he said. "I'm assuming you were looking into the Maruska family."

The tired-looking man raised his eyebrows in surprise. "Yes," he said.

"Which book did you pull that name from?" asked Dumbledore, not appearing surprised at all.

"Hogwarts: A Dark History," said Draco.

"I've never heard of that one," said Remus.

"Because it is contraband," said Dumbledore. "Still, it makes for excellent rainy day reading. I was always partial to chapter four myself."

Draco smirked. The alleged relationship between Slytherin's grandson and Gryffindor's grandniece was quite controversial. Some who believed the tale also believed that Shakespeare had been told the story by a wandering gypsy woman and had written 'Romeo and Juliet' based off of the account.

"Yes," Dumbledore continued. "I sent Remus to discover if the rumor, that the Maruska's had been members of the famous raiding party of 1536. The headmaster at the time allowed a group of gypsies to stay at the school because of a treacherous storm. The gypsies were actually a band of infamous thieves, who boasted that they could steal anything, including artifacts from Hogwarts. They ransacked the treasure room and made their escape. Most were apprehended, but a few slipped away with several items. The Maruska's had several close friends implicated and so suspicion fell on them as well, but nothing was every proven."

"And that was when Hufflepuffs cup went missing," said Draco.

"Precisely," said Dumbledore. "I am positive that Voldemort discovered its location and turned it into a Horcrux; however, with his fall, the cup was lost. It is not inconceivable that the Maruskas would steal it back, for it is a valuable object in as of itself. It was rumored that Helga had placed powerful charms upon goblets, ones which could disable any potion placed inside, but also, after repeated use of the cup, make the drinker produce an immunity against most posions."

"It also had quite a bit of monetary value," said Draco. "I could see it sell on the black market for no less than twenty million galleons."

"That much?" asked Lupin.

"Twenty-five to thirty at an auction," said Draco, "but if it was advertised, it would just ask to be stolen."

"My thought as well," said Dumbledore. "An artifact such as that would not stay in the same hands for very long."

"Especially with the raids from the Aurors," said Draco.

"You mean the Aurors might have it in their possession?" asked Lupin.

Draco shook his head. "I'm talking about an Erus Feles, or a master thief. A raid by the Aurors is a perfect set up. The Aurors barge in, throw the family out, and start rummaging. While they are searching for dark objects, the Feles slips in. The thieves are usually hired by the neighbors, who are also into dark magic and know right where to look for the most valuable artifacts."

"But how would a thief know when the Aurors are going to raid?" asked Bill, speaking up for the first time, which Draco found out of character as well. He wondered if Bill was feeling alright.

"Because the neighbors are just as wealthy and affluent as the people they rob," said Draco. "It's easy, with that money, to get advanced notice of a raid, especially when you're not interested in a raid on your own home."

"So, we need to figure out who's been robbing who," said Sirius.

"It's more complicated than that," said Draco. "Sometimes the thieves run with the goods, which is a risky move, but not unheard of. My guess is that happened with the cup."

"How so?" queried Dumbledore.

Draco shrugged. "The Parkinson's have two Trojan doors. The original owners were the Cassius family, which died out in the 1800's. The doors have switched hands eighteen times since then. The Nott's have the last portrait of Rowena Ravenclaw stolen from the Armedes Art Gallery, but again, the painting has been bouncing back and forth for five decades. I would know if something as big as Hufflepuffs cup was circling around the Pureblood circle in England."

"How would we include the thieves in our search?" asked Kingsley. "I could have them dragged into the Auror's office for inquisition, but I don't think they would talk."

"There is a list," said Draco. "It's not entirely intact, so you can only find a thief for a house from the potion's dealer in Knockturn Alley, the art gallery specialists in the Hogshead, and so on. It offers a little more security that way."

"Will we have to inquire after all of them?" asked Bill.

Draco shook his head. "The cup would have been under heavy wards. Some of the security on these hidden safes is staggering, and it can take a few raids to actually get the safe open. Not to mention, the job does require a good amount of stealth. The Aurors are everywhere, and they could walk in without any notice at all. There are only a handful of thieves who could do that."

"And you are one of them," said Severus.

Draco raised an eyebrow. "Pardon?"

"You talk as if the job is exciting, and you know far too much about it. Don't tell me you've never tried," said Snape, the only other Slytherin in the room, which might explain why he read Draco so well.

Draco flushed. "I may have been interested in the career when I was younger. It made dinner parties more bearable."

Bill shook his head. "Only you, Draco."

"So we should look into who may have owned the cup, and see if we can't at least pick up the trail," said Kingsley.

"And that should be the easy part. Once objects drop off, they don't easily reappear." Draco turned back to Severus. "I suppose the Dark Lord is stepping up his own hunt?"

"He is searching quite obsessively, but he hasn't confirmed that it is the cup he is looking for," said Snape. "He's even been raiding the homes of Purebloods."

"Well, at least he's completely clueless too," said Bill.

"I could start compiling a list of thieves who could pull off a heist like this," said Draco. "I'm not exactly up-to-date, but it's a start."

"We've got lists at the Auror HQ as well," said Kingsley. "We can cross reference them."

Draco nodded. "Good. We should also look into families who could afford the cup. It may have been purchased a few times and there are only fourteen families who could drop that much without financial assistance."

"Excellent," said Dumbledore. "We'll get started immediately, right after breakfast."

Draco shot the old man a look, but then Mrs. Weasley bustled in, greeting the men and then continuing right on to the kitchen.

Draco wanted to say 'We could get started now', but he didn't think any of the men would agree with him.

"If you'll excuse me," said Snape, rising to his feet, "I've got a few potions brewing that need to be attended." He nodded to the table, returned the glare from Sirius, and then Flooed away. Draco was pretty sure the man was just beating a hasty retreat.

"Draco, how sure are you on the number of families who can afford the cup?" asked Kingsley and Draco turned to the Auror.

"Pretty sure," he said. "Of course, illegal tender would have to be taken into account. If so, than we should look into the Damian family, maybe the Mansfield's as well. That's sixteen, seventeen if you include me."

"I thought you were cut off," said Lupin.

"I am," said Draco. "But I had my own account which became mine when I turned seventeen and that was before the fact."

"So you can drop twenty-five to thirty million," said Sirius.

"No," said Draco. "I could spend twenty on it at a private sale. For the auction," he stopped and considered how well his investments had been doing, "I might have to take out a mortgage on my place in France." It would be a small mortgage though. He was doing quite well.

"You have a place in France?" asked Kingsley.

Draco shrugged. "It's an old family estate, nothing too large."

Dumbledore snorted. "I wouldn't call the Procella Ortus not too large. Quite a beautiful home. I visited your great-grandmother there once. Quite a capital woman."

Draco raised an eyebrow, surprised at the news, even though he shouldn't have been shocked at anything the old Headmaster did or said anymore.

"Oh, are we having an Order meeting?" asked Hermione, coming into the room with Harry and Ron.

"Just a before-breakfast information session," said Dumbledore. "We'll be having one tonight."

"Having what tonight?" asked Fred, coming in with his identical brother.

"Order meeting," said Ron.

"Excellent," said Fred.

"Means we'll have cake," said George.

Harry sat next to Draco. The boy-hero seemed to have taken it upon himself to socialize Draco into the family.

"How's the Parseltongue going?" he asked.

"Slowly," said Draco. "I don't suppose anyone has ever created a written language for it, have they?"

"There used to be one, back when it was more common, at least, that's what the snakes say. It died out though because no one spoke it anymore. Why?"

"I think I'll create one," said Draco. "Don't know if I'll ever speak it, but writing it shouldn't be too hard. I'll have to create a new alphabet, because s-r-l-s should be it's own letter it's used so often and I'll have to figure out the grammar syntax and punctuation, but after that's, it's pretty straight forward."

Harry looked at him. "You actually sound excited. There's something wrong with you."

"What's wrong with who?" asked Ginny, coming in with Charlie and her father. She sat across from Draco while Harry jerked his head towards him.

"He's wrong."

"Says the Boy-Who-Can't-Die," Draco muttered, rolling his eyes.

"Oh, come now, boys. You have to learn to play nice," said Ginny. Draco ignored her to the best of his abilities. He had spent the entire night trying to convince himself and he had not kissed Ginevra Weasley and that she had not kissed him. Self-delusion was never his strong-point.

Fleur created a stir right then, to which he was grateful, by coming out into the dining room, holding Lukas in her arms. There was a loud hail from the table, several people clamoring to hold the baby.

"Settle down," said Bill, mock-glaring at them all. He took the baby and kissed Fleur on the lips. Mr. Weasley pulled out a chair for her.

"Thank you," said Fleur, sitting down.

"Now," said Bill, "who hasn't had the chance to hold Lukas?"

The twins raised their hands, but Bill just rolled his eyes. "Harry," he said, "do you want to?"

"I don't want to drop him, or anything," said Harry.

"You won't," said Bill. He placed the baby in Harry's arms and Draco scooted farther away.

"Hey," said Harry softly to the infant. He rocked the baby, getting an idiotic grin on his face. Hermione was smiling as well, watching her boyfriend holding the child.

"Iiich," the baby grunted and everyone 'aww'ed. Draco rolled his eyes, glad when Mrs. Weasley came back out with the food and Bill took the baby back to Fleur. He may have been the godfather, but that didn't mean he was going to fawn over the thing.

He poured himself a cup of coffee as the usual breakfast chaos set in.

"Harry, pass the eggs, would you, dear?"

"Oy, Fred, cut it out, would you?"

"Charlie, toast please."

"Fred, what did I just say?"

"I'm George."

"Charlie, could you pass the toast?"

"Tornado's may not win this year, did you see the pre-match?"

"But he got off because the Aurors, when they took him in, didn't immediately cast the Prior Incantum on his wand. His lawyer said that the Aurors could have cast it in the meantime, but we all know Evans is a sneaky bastard-,"

"Ginny!"

"Charlie! Toast? Thanks."

"Sorry."

"We'll it's mostly cleaned up. They're just re-setting the wards now."

That was Kingsley and Draco tuned into that conversation.

"Although," the Auror continued, "we've stolen the warders away from your school, sorry about that Albus. It looks like it might be a long Christmas break after all."

"Ah yes," lamented Dumbledore, "the children will be so devastated." His eyes twinkled.

"When will the Ministry open back up for business?" asked Lupin.

"The lower offices have already been open, and the rest should follow in three days or less. After that, it's just a few minor details."

"Like getting the plumbing working," said Mr. Weasley. "We have to Floo out to find a working toilet."

Ah, yes, Draco had nearly forgotten that the Weasley patriarch was now overseeing the Muggle Artifacts Office.

"Arthur, that hardly breakfast conversation," Mrs. Weasley scolded.

Kingsley laughed, a deep, booming laugh. "He makes a good point though, Molly. Fudge's private restroom is already up and running, in fact, it was up before the fifth floor had lights."

"How about your Headquarters?" asked Lupin.

"We're fully restored, and not hindered at all. That's what's good about having a secondary office. Still, some of the other departments aren't so lucky and shifts are extended, some even to Christmas Eve."

"That's not right at all," said Mrs. Weasley. "Making those poor people work on a holiday."

"The Aurors are pulling double shifts on Christmas," said Kingsley. "With Voldemort not caring much about holidays, we're afraid he might try something, crush morale and such."

"You don't really think-?" Mr. Weasley started, but Kingsley nodded gravely.

"Still," said Mrs. Weasley, with forced cheer. "We don't know for certain. Let's not be looking for a storm."

About every conversation ended just then and there was a pleasant lull. Draco liked the quiet.

Ginny tapped his leg under the table and he turned, eyebrow raised. He didn't exactly want to talk to her just then.

"You know, Draco," she said, "if you were waiting for a perfect time to ask my dad for permission to date me, now is as good as ever."

Every head whipped towards the middle of the table where Ginny sat across from him. Draco stared, as did the rest of the diners. The Weasley brothers were completely frozen; Fred and George were holding their forks half-way to their mouths.

Draco managed to recover relatively quickly from the shock.

"I don't want to date you," he told her.

"Don't be ridiculous," said Ginny.

Draco looked from her to Bill who was shifting uncomfortably. Draco put down his fork and ran a hand through his hair.

"Ginny," said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, "what's this?"

"Draco and I want to go out," said Ginny, giving her mother a smile.

"Absolutely not!" Fred exclaimed, dropping his fork onto his plate. George followed suit.

"Over our dead bodies!" he cried.

"Fred, George," said Ginny, "shut it."

"You're not dating a Malfoy, Gin," said Fred.

"Yeah, so it's Malfoy, but he's a Malfoy," said George.

"Way to sound not prejudiced," said Ginny, rolling her eyes.

"It's Malfoy," they chorused.

"Boys, please," said Mr. Weasley, trying for some semblance of control. "Ginny, this isn't funny."

"I'm not joking," said Ginny. "Draco and I want to go out."

"You want to go out," said Draco. "You do; not me."

"Way to be a man," said Ginny.

"It's just that this is rather sudden," said Mrs. Weasley, her voice sounding somewhat faint. Her hand was at her throat and she was glancing towards her husband, as if asking that he do something.

"Draco and I went to the Halloween dance together," said Ginny shrugging.

"You did what?" Fred and George yelped.

"You went with him?" Mrs. Weasley demanded.

"Yes, I went with Draco," said Ginny. "What's even worse is that I asked him to the dance."

"You did what?"

"You asked him?"

"You didn't even write to tell us? What if something had happened!"

"Nothing happened, mum."

"Ron, did you know about this?" Mrs. Weasley demanded of her youngest son, and then the chaos started again, this time ten-times worse. Lupin looked distinctly uncomfortable, Kingsley looked endlessly amused, and Dumbledore twinkled at them all.

"Really, it wasn't that big of a deal, mum."

"You're supposed to be watching out for your sister."

"You are not dating him."

"Oh, come off it."

"I'm actually with Ginny on this one."

"Thanks Harry."

"Now, don't you give her any ideas, Wonder-boy."

"Hey! That was completely uncalled for."

"Ginny, I'm just saying that this is sudden."

"It's not the suddenness we're worried about."

"I'm not worried about what you're worried about. I can date who I damn well please."

"Ginny!"

"I'm sixteen, mum."

"Yeah, like that makes a difference."

"Ron dated Lavender Brown for Merlin's sake. The girl who thought she was pregnant last year!"

"Wait, seriously?"

"Ginny, that's not the point."

"Why don't you let her explain?"

"Thanks Charlie."

"Ginny, have you really thought about this?"

Draco closed his eyes briefly at the noise and took a breath. He reopened them and turned to Mr. Weasley who wasn't joining in the general chaos.

Mr. Weasley jerked his head and stood. Draco scooted his chair back and followed Mr. Weasley into the living-room-turned-nursery. The table fell silent behind them, and then Draco shut the door.

Mr. Weasley crossed to the window, staring out, his hands crossed behind his back. Draco shifted, letting his fingers fly along their pattern. Mr. Weasley turned.

"You want to date my daughter," he said.

Draco hesitated for a split second, but then nodded. "Yes," he said, not fully deciding until the word was out of his mouth. Yes, this was most likely going to end horribly, but she wouldn't stay out of his head. Maybe this way he could get over her. Besides, the entire table already voiced their opinions on the matter, they might have well voiced them for a reason.

"It doesn't sound like it."

"It's a little…complicated," said Draco, wincing once the words were out of his mouth.

"Would you care to explain it to me then?" asked Mr. Weasley. "Because I'm not letting you out of this room until you tell me exactly what is happening between you and my daughter and I swear, if I don't like what you are saying, you are leaving this house, do you understand me?"

"Yes, sir," said Draco, the 'sir' just seeming to fit in this situation.

"So explain why you told my daughter you didn't want to date her."

Draco swallowed, forcing his fingers to slow down, tapping out his pattern deliberately as he spoke.

"I haven't had a relationship with anyone like your daughter before," he said. "It's not that I don't find Ginny's company enjoyable, but I've generally left her type of girl alone."

"Why is that?"

Draco winced again, but he knew that, as a Gryffindor and a father, Arthur Weasley was looking for honesty and he must already know the truth. "I've usually gone for girls who were more interested in the benefits of dating, other than the relationship itself."

"So you've been playing around," said Mr. Weasley, not giving him an inch. "And now you want me to let you date my daughter. Why?"

"Because I'm interested in her," said Draco, the words coming out easier than he thought. "She's funny, she's smart, and she needs someone who can keep up with her. Also because she seems to have this weird liking for me and she won't take 'no' for an answer. Believe me, I've tried."

"You've tried telling her no and now you're what? Just giving in?"

"I've tried saying 'no' because I don't think we're going to make the best of couples."

"So she's not the right girl for you?"

"In a sense," said Draco, "yes. The other side of that is that I'm not right for her. I haven't been particularly nice for most of my life and I don't get along with most people. She is and does. I've tried to tell her that."

"So if you do date her, you're not even going to try to make it work?"

"No, I will," said Draco. "But that also means I'm not going to force myself to change all my ways just for her. I'm interested, but that's it."

"Good," said Mr. Weasley. "You're too young for binding promises of love anyway. Now, you do understand that Ginny is a good girl and I'm not going to let you pressure her into doing anything she doesn't feel comfortable with, right?"

"I like who Ginny is and I'm not going to change that," said Draco.

"And I'm supposed to believe you?"

"Yes," said Draco.

Mr. Weasley gave a small smile. "Fair enough. I suppose that this is the part that I threaten you with bodily harm if you hurt her, but I think you can fill in the blanks."

"Yes, sir."

"One last question. Your second year, what happened?"

Arthur Weasley seemed to be waiting for something, and Draco could tell that this question had more importance than most of the others, but he didn't know why.

"Are you referring to the Dark Lord reopening the Chamber of Secrets?" he asked.

Mr. Weasley seemed to relax, as if a weight was lifted. "It was Ginny's first year," he said. "She's younger than you, still sixteen and while you are ready for a career after this, she still has school and she will stay in school. None of this new-fangled trend of leaving school for a boyfriend, got it?"

"Yes, sir," said Draco, feeling as if there was another reason for the question, but he couldn't tell what.

"Good," said Mr. Weasley. "You have my permission to date my daughter. We'll be moving you to the third floor because while you are living in the same house, I don't have to like the idea of you sharing a bathroom or being able to sneak into each other's rooms, understand?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good, send in Ginny."

Draco nodded and left the room. Ginny was waiting outside and Draco nodded to the door. She slipped in and he leaned against the wall, watching as the door closed behind her. He wondered what he had just got himself into.

Ginny closed the door and gave her dad a hesitant smile. He didn't return it.

"Ginny," he said seriously, "the only reason I am even remotely allowing this is because he doesn't know what happened your first year."

Ginny nodded.

"The other only reason is that he seems to be level-headed and isn't love-crazed like some of the other boy's you've brought home. The third only reason is that you seem to be set on him."

Ginny gave her dad a small smile. "He's so cute, I have to date him."

She watched her dad pause for a second before registering that she was joking. He gave a tired smile.

"Did it really have to be Draco Malfoy of all people?"

"You do realize that his father would being saying the rough equivalent of that, if he wasn't disowned, that is."

Maybe not the best of ideas to bring up Lucius Malfoy, she thought as her dad frowned, getting that murderous look in his eye that only the Malfoy patriarch could bring out. She wondered how much of it was from old grudges and how much was because Lucius Malfoy had slipped her the diary of Thomas Marvolo Riddle.

She walked over to her dad and gave him a hug.

"Draco's a nice guy," she said.

"That's not what he told me."

"He's being modest."

A slight paused and then both of them laughed.

"Alright," she said, pulling away, "so not being modest. He just likes to think that he still has the whole 'bad boy' persona going on. He's rather proud of being in Slytherin."

"Are you sure you want to date him then?"

"Dad, he's the hottest guy in school, filthy rich even without his father's money, and on top of that, he's a genius. He's every girl's dream come true."

Again, sometimes her dad didn't always understand when she was joking. He got that concerned furrow of his brow.

"I just want to make sure that he makes you happy and that you're not just dating him to make the other girls jealous."

"Dad," she said, "I like him, really."

"Good, I'm glad to hear it. You know, Ginny, you never needed my approval. I do trust you to make your own decisions. You're a smart girl and I'm very proud of you."

Ginny kissed her dad on the cheek. "Thank you."

"Just be careful."

"Promise," said Ginny, backing towards the door.

"And don't let him do anything that you're not comfortable with because some guys only have one thing on their mind."

"Dad!"

"I'm just saying, Ginny."

"I'm leaving now," said Ginny shaking her head. She made it to the door and opened it, trying to stifle her laughter. She stopped when she saw Draco.

He was leaning against the wall, arms loosely crossed and his hair was falling into his face. Merlin, he looked good.

"Hey," she said.

"So what's the verdict?" asked Draco.

He sounded as if he didn't care, but Ginny didn't base her assumptions on how he sounded, or how he looked. He wasn't an expressive person, and so she judged him by what he did and what he said, or didn't say. Draco had talked with her father, and from the sound of it, defended a position on how he wanted to date her.

She smiled. "My dad's fine with it."

"I doubt that."

"Alright, maybe not fine with it, but he's going to let us date."

His eyebrow rose fractionally, as if surprised. "I suppose we might as well make this official then. I'm working with Dumbledore and Kingsley at the moment, but I should have some time free after lunch. Would your parents let you out of the house?"

"Yes, as long as we're not gone long."

"Was there something in particular you wanted to do?"

She understood what that line meant. She kneew that Draco was usually the initiator of a relationship, deciding where they would go and when. Draco could read his other girlfriends, knew what they wanted, but he wasn't sure with her. He was still a little wary.

"Let's go to Muggle London," she said. "You can buy me some ice cream."

Two reasons for Muggle London. One, her parents wouldn't exactly be thrilled to let her loose in the Wizarding world when Death Eaters were running about. Two, Draco probably didn't want their relationship displayed on every newspaper the next day. They were both rather conspicuous, what with their hair color, and Draco was already a bit of a celebrity because of his disownment and because the children who had been rescued after the Hogwarts attacked told of Draco's involvement in the escape. Ginny wanted him to enjoy the date, not dodge reporters, even if that meant she couldn't show him off.

Third reason, there was an adorable ice cream parlor just down the road from the Leaky Cauldron and they had an amazing blend of flavors.

Draco nodded, and she could see his shoulders relax slightly. Muggle London was the right pick.

"Great," she said, knowing that she was grinning like an idiot. She managed to calm the smile down. "After lunch. See you then."

She immediately went upstairs and grabbed Hermione from the drawing room. "I need your help." She pulled her into her room and threw open her closet doors. Hermione took a seat on her bed.

"I can't believe you're actually dating Draco Malfoy."

"What?" asked Ginny. "Didn't think it could be done?"

"Honestly? No."

Ginny laughed, but then stopped after she looked through her wardrobe.

"I have nothing to wear," she said. She groaned and tugged at a strand of her hair. "Mione, what am I going to wear?"

"What about the ivory shirt you just bought?"

"We're walking around Muggle London."

"So something warmer then."

"Yeah."

"Well, you bought that blue long-sleeved shirt, and that looks darling on you."

"But I can't wear something I just bought. It'll look like I'm trying too hard."

"What's wrong with that?"

"Because I can't be too interested in him, you know? He's so emotionally cool that I can't express the fact that I'm completely ecstatic to even be walking with him."

Hermione grinned. "You have it bad for him, don't you?"

Ginny groaned as she felt her cheeks burn up. She covered her face with her hands until she could feel the red fading. She looked at Hermione.

"I don't want to scare him off."

"He's faced down Voldemort. I doubt a girl is going to send him running."

Ginny fell silent, remembering when he had kissed her, when she had kissed him.

"Ginny, what?" asked Hermione.

"Promise not to tell?" she asked.

"Always," said Hermione.

"Okay then," said Ginny. She joined Hermione on the bed and quickly related what had happened the other day, her cheeks flaming as she did so.

"He did what?" Hermione had demanded as she tried to gloss over the fact that he had taken her bra off.

"He was trying to tell me not to date him," said Ginny. "He told me that I was in over my head, that he shouldn't get involved with me, but I wouldn't listen. So he proved it to me."

"Then what?" asked Hermione.

"He left, I cried, and then I went to confront him late that night and kissed him, just to prove that he did want to date me."

"You initiated a kiss with Draco Malfoy?"

"I had him up against a wall and everything," said Ginny.

"Are you serious?" Hermione exclaimed, looking half-awed, half-mortified.

"Completely," said Ginny.

"Wow," said Hermione. She fell silent for a moment before speaking up. "You do realize you have one of the most messed-up relationships and you just started today?"

"Yeah," said Ginny. She waited, wondering if Hermione was going to disapprove.

Hermione looked up at her. "So he must be a really good kisser than, right? To get your bra off and you didn't even notice?"

Ginny laughed, grabbing a pillow to hide her face because her face was scarlet even though she was smiling so hard it hurt. She peered out and nodded.

"Amazing kisser," she said. "Incredible. The room spun and I saw stars and everything."

Hermione squealed happily, as only teenaged girls can, and Ginny buried her face in the pillow again. She looked up a few minutes later.

"Okay, on a serious note," she said, "I really have nothing to wear."

By lunch she had found the perfect outfit. Draco was eating with Dumbledore and Kingsley in the study as they picked over a few names, and it was probably for the best. Her brothers were all at the table in silence, staring at her.

"You aren't seriously dating him, are you?" asked Fred.

"Because it would be just like you to plan this elaborate joke," said George.

"She's not joking," said Ron, taking a sip of juice. Ron wasn't against the relationship; he just wasn't completely for it.

"Mate, seems to me you ought to be a little more upset," said Fred.

"Yeah, I mean, you can't stand the git," said George.

"And the git saved my life," said Ron. "I'm not thrilled, but he's alright."

Fred and George looked to each other, shifting uncomfortably as they remembered.

"Right, so maybe he's not so bad," George allowed and Fred nodded.

"He isn't," said Harry. "And he has the sweetest car ever. Convertible."

"Malfoy has a car?" asked Fred.

"What kind?" asked George.

"Cadillac," said Harry. "Picked me up from my house before school started and we got chased by Death Eaters through London."

"Wait, that was you?" asked Ron. The event had been reported in the news. "You didn't tell me."

"Draco threatened me," said Harry, "but I figure Ginny will protect me."

Ginny shot him a grin.

"Arthur," said her mum to her dad as he was staying home today; Ginny thought he might be staying just to make sure everything went well. "Arthur, I don't know if I like the idea of an automobile. Those are pretty dangerous."

"We're just walking around town," said Ginny. "Getting ice cream and what not."

"Ice cream in this weather?" asked her mum. "I don't want you catching a cold."

"And you also don't want me dating Draco," snapped Ginny, getting fed up with the attention. She saw her mother look down, pursing her lips, and she sighed. "I promise, mum, best behavior from both of us. And let's not forget I can handle myself. I did get him with the Bat-Boogey my fourth year."

Her mum looked to Bill. "You do vouch for him?"

"I shouldn't think he needed to be vouched for anymore," said Bill. Ginny knew he disapproved of all the questioning as well.

"Trusting him to live here is one thing," said her mother. "Trusting him to date your sister is another. Let's not forget, it was his fa-,"

Draco stepped into the room from the hall and her mother fell silent. Ginny didn't think Draco heard, but he must have known they were talking about him because his expression was too blank and his cheeks faintly flushed.

"I'm just," he said, gesturing for the stairs, as if he had to explain himself. He looked to Ginny. "About ready?" he asked, avoiding everyone else's gaze.

She nodded. "Five minutes?"

He nodded as well and then walked quickly through the room and to the stairs. Once he was out of sight Ginny turned back to glare at her family.

"Thanks," she said. She got up. "I'm going to brush my teeth and grab my coat. How about you don't all wait for us to get back?"

She ran up the stairs to brush her hair one more time and then brush her teeth. Draco was just coming out of the bathroom as she started for it and there was an awkward moment of passing, a half-smile on her part and a brief nod on his. Ginny winced once he had gone.

She made sure she was presentable before she went down. She had to admit, Hermione was right. The clingy white v-neck, paired with the jeans and her light brown coat looked perfect together with the right accessories and her hair was actually cooperating today with just the right amount of curls. Hermione had helped with her make-up as well. Mascara, a sea-blue eyeliner to bring out her eyes, and lip gloss. She looked pretty, but in a casual, I-didn't-try-at-all ran downstairs after shoving her shoes on, sensible dark-blue tennis shoes. They would be walking after all.

"Ginny, grab a hat and some gloves in case you get cold," her mum called.

"I'm fine," said Ginny.

Draco was waiting for her by the door. He had changed as well, into jeans and a grey sweater. The clothes were casual but they must have cost a fortune because they fit him perfectly. He was wearing a black coat over it, again the fine fit betraying its expense, but Ginny wasn't fazed as other girls might have been.

She gave him a smile.

"Shall we?"

He gave a smirk, but it was a pleasant one, if that was at all possible. He opened the door for her and she stepped out.

Again, no update next week, but it's a lovely place to pause, so how about leaving a review for the tired author, huh?





11. THe First Date

Disclaimer: Nope, not mine. Otherwise I could write fanfic all day.

Author's note: Apologies. I took three weeks instead of two. I kinda didn't realize that I had a complete week of tests after break. But they're done now, yay, and I'm back on track with the story. Huzzah!

Ooo, real quick. I just wrote this chapter, and I've got five minutes to post it, so I'm not exactly proof-reading. Sorry for mistakes.

Draco walked alongside Ginny, wondering if he should say something or just keep quiet. Usually, with the other girls, he would compliment them. They would simper, say something back and then grab his arm and lean in for a kiss. Ginny wasn't like them though and so he stayed quiet because the silence was comfortable and he didn't need to talk. He was pleased that she didn't have to either and they walked for two blocks this way.

"I'm sorry for all of that back there," said Ginny as they crossed a street.

He looked over, knowing what she was referring to.

"It's fine."

"No, not really," she said. "I mean, I practically forced you to ask me out and then made it rather awkward for you, so sorry. I mean, not for asking you out, just the awkward part."

The corner of his lip twitched.

"Awww," said Ginny, stopping in front of a store window. Draco stopped as well, reading the store sign 'The Pet Place' and then at the window where a few cats were lounging in cages. Ginny was looking at the puppy though. It was racing around a fenced in area on the floor and it caught sight of Ginny outside. It ran over, tongue hanging out and leaned its front paws against the window sill.

Ginny pressed her hand against the glass and the dog tried to sniff it and then licked the window.

"Let's go in," said Ginny.

"Must we?" asked Draco, but only because he knew he was going to be dragged in one way or the other.

"Yes," said Ginny. "We must."

He followed her into the store where there were a few families inside, reaching into cages to pet rabbits or cats. A few were reaching over the fence to pet the puppy which was some sort of lab-retriever mix with golden fur. Ginny leaned over the fence and the dog went straight to her, jumping up against the fence and lapping at her fingers eagerly.

"Oh, look at you," said Ginny, stroking behind the puppy's ears. "You are a gorgeous little dog, aren't you?"

The puppy was practically wriggling under the attention, occasionally taking an excited lap around the fence only to come straight back to Ginny.

"You do know you can't keep it," said Draco, stepping closer to cast an eye over the dog.

"Oh, shush," said Ginny. "We're having fun."

Draco scowled at the puppy, but Ginny looked over and caught his expression.

"Oh, no," she said. "Don't tell me you're a cat person."

"Would that be bad?" asked Draco.

"I am a complete dog person, always will be. How much of a cat person are you?"

"I'm just not a pet person in general," said Draco.

"How can you not like animals? Especially puppies. They are so cute."

"And they smell and they chew things and they need constant attention," said Draco.

Ginny just laughed at him.

To his relief, they didn't stay long, just until Ginny had her fill of puppy-petting, and then she wiped her hands with the anti-bacterial gel that was provided. Draco had a feeling she might have left earlier than normal because she felt he wasn't enjoying himself. Oddly enough, he had been quite content to watch her pet the puppy.

"Is there a particular place you wanted for your ice cream?" asked Draco.

"Yes," said Ginny. "This way."

She walked down the steps to a tube station and he dutifully followed, scouting out the Muggles that hurried to and fro, looking for anyone who might have posed a threat. It wasn't that he was wary of pick-pockets, he could usually spot them quite easily, but just because the Muggle and Magical world were separate, didn't mean that they never mixed. The Dark Lord had spies everywhere.

It was a relatively short ride on the tube. Draco knew where they were, about a block from the Leakey Cauldron, but he had never entered the store Ginny led him into. It was an ice cream parlor but decorated like a jazz-playing coffee shop. She led him to the counter where they peered into the long freezer boasting more flavors of ice cream than he had ever seen in one place.

The specialty sign said to mix three flavors together for a sensational treat.

"What's your favorite kind?" Ginny asked.

Draco shrugged. "Don't know."

Ginny turned to look at him. "Sometimes I want to cry for you," she said.

He knew that she was only half-joking.

"Decided yet?" asked the woman at the counter with a small smile. It was winter, and right after lunch, and so they were the only ones in the shop.

"A scoop of strawberry, coconut, and French vanilla," said Ginny. She turned to Draco. "Decided yet?"

"Do you know how many combinations are possible?" asked Draco.

"You're the genius," said Ginny. "Shouldn't you have some weird equation you can use to make up your own mind?"

Draco rolled his eyes but turned to the woman. "Coffee, chocolate and raspberry."

She rang them up and Draco saw Ginny reaching into her pocket, but he stepped up first, handing over his credit card. Ginny raised her eyebrow at the card. Once they had their ice cream and were seated in a comfortable booth, she spoke up.

"Isn't a credit card a little Muggle for you?"

"Probably," said Draco. "It was useful though."

"When?" asked Ginny.

"Last summer," said Draco, "when I left home."

"Ah," said Ginny. "What did you do?"

"Went to the States."

"Is it nice?"

"Some nice areas, some not so nice," he said vaguely. Talking about himself had never come easily. Too many survivor instincts wanted him to keep quiet.

"I would like to travel," said Ginny. "We went to Egypt to visit Bill once, when he was still a curse-breaker, and that was a blast, but a little too hot."

"It is hot down there," Draco agreed.

"You've been?"

"Yeah, when I was younger. Used to travel a lot."

"Where's your favorite place to visit?" asked Ginny. "And no saying you don't have one. If you could go one place, right now, where would it be?"

If it had been any other girl, Draco would have said 'I'm happy right here with you' or something to that regard. The girl would have thought it was cliché, but sweet and would have scooted over to his side of the bench and heavy kissing would follow. It was Ginny though and so he actually considered the question.

"Right now, Italy."

"Where in Italy?"

"The south," said Draco. "There's a wizarding town right on the coast."

"And why there?"

"Why does it matter?"

"Because I'm curious."

Draco shook his head at her. "It's quiet there."

"As opposed to headquarters right now."

"You people don't mind your own business. And you're rather loud."

"Can't deny that," said Ginny. "You should have seen our house when we were growing up. Chaos."

"I do not know why your parents had all of you," said Draco, falling into her usual style of light banter.

Ginny laughed. "Because they were trying for me, or rather, a girl. They had Bill and Charlie, and thought three would be nice, and they wanted a girl, if possible, so they tried once more and ended up with Percy. They decided that one more couldn't hurt, and they were still hoping for me, so they had one more that turned out to be Fred and George."

"Nasty surprise," said Draco.

She nodded. "Mum really wanted a girl, and Dad did too, even if he denied it, so then they had Ron."

Draco's lips quirked at her phrasing and she caught sight of it and grinned herself.

"They didn't even intend to have me," she said. "But they were happy."

"What about your brothers?" asked Draco.

"They all wanted a sister," said Ginny. "You could say I was spoiled as a child."

"Never would have guessed," said Draco.

"Hey!" said Ginny. "Speak for yourself."

Draco just smirked. They ate in silence for a while, Ginny stealing a bit of his ice cream. Draco spoke up, because it was his turn to make conversation and because he was interested.

"Do you have a favorite brother?" he asked.

"I can tell you were an only child," said Ginny. "Having a favorite brother would be saying that you loved your dad more than your mum."

"I hate Narcissa," said Draco.

He hadn't intended to say that, and the words surprised him. Ginny looked up, surprised as well.

"I'm sorry to hear that," she said.

He looked down at his ice cream, feeling her gaze on his face. She answered his question, stepping away from his momentary outburst.

"Well, the point I was trying to make is that I love all my brothers the same. There are, however, a few I like more than the others, but that usually just depends on what's going on. Ron is a bit overprotective, and he can overreact like none other, but at the same time, he definitely covered for me quite a few times and he would never rat me out. Fred and George are great for a laugh, but sometimes you just need a few minutes of quiet. I swear they never shut up, and they can't be serious about anything, except maybe with each other. Percy was good for homework help and tough decisions, but he left. I think he just saw our family as ridiculous and he wanted to be taken seriously in his career. I don't think mum and dad helped there."

"They kicked him out?" asked Draco.

Ginny shook her head. "Percy disagreed on a few political matters, and mum and dad tried to convince him he was wrong. When he got a job at the Ministry, they were a bit too adamant about their disapproval, and Fred and George used to ride on him, so he just moved out. Haven't heard from him since."

"I'm sorry," said Draco.

Ginny shrugged. "It happens you know. I think he still writes to Charlie. Charlie is the person you go to if you need an ear. He will just listen to whatever it is you say. He won't give opinions most of the time, which is a little aggravating, but he can keep a secret. And Bill, Bill is great. After I was born, mum got really sick, and Bill was there. He's a best friend and a brother all at the same time, and he was always interested in what I was doing and what I thought, even when I was a kid."

She smiled, no doubt at some memory.

"What about your brother?" she asked. "What was he like? I mean, you don't have to answer if you don't want, but-,"

"It's fine," said Draco. "Lukas was a lot like Bill, but…more carefree, I guess. He was always smiling, always laughing. He was a flirt too, a big one. I was somewhat surprised that Laney was actually legitimate."

"That's horrid!" Ginny exclaimed, but she was laughing and he shrugged.

"It's the truth," he said. "I remember sometimes he would take me to the park just so women would approach him."

"He didn't," said Ginny.

Draco nodded, feeling his lips quirk up at the memory. He didn't like thinking about his brother because he could never block out the bad memories, watching him fall with the green light, but it was easier with Ginny. For some reason, her light was infectious.

"He did. And I played along of course because then he would take me and the girl out to lunch, and it was usually at a nice place."

"Already a Slytherin, weren't you?"

Draco shrugged a shoulder and smirked lightly. "Perhaps."

It was a pleasant atmosphere in the ice cream parlor, and the conversation flowed easily. They threw out their bowls once they were finished and walked back outside, blinking in the sudden sunlight.

They turned back to the Headquarters together and Ginny grabbed his hand, intertwining their fingers. Draco made no move to let go.

They held hands the entire way back. Draco had never really held hands with his girlfriends before. He was used to linking arms with them, pressing up against each other. Holding hands was strangely more intimate in its innocence. Ginny liked to swing their arms slightly, tugging on his hand to call his attention to some building or group of people.

It was a short trip, but enjoyable. Draco was actually disappointed that they came back to Grimmauld Place. If leaving had been such a hassle, who knew what interrogation was lying in wait for them once they arrived.

They were just stepping up onto the porch when the door swung open and Fred and George appeared. They looked at the two of them and Draco hurriedly dropped Ginny's hand.

"Did you have fun?" asked Fred.

"Not too much fun I hope," said George.

Ginny groaned. "I thought I said don't wait for us," she said.

"We weren't," the twins said quickly.

"I was talking it over with Forge here," said Fred.

"And we decided that maybe we were a bit harsh on the ferret, seeing as he's been playing nice since he got here," George continued.

"And mum was having a bit of a fit and was looking out the kitchen window every five-,"

"I'd say three-,"

"Every four minutes and dad was pacing a bit."

"So we may have set off a few dung bombs, just for a distraction."

"We were also trying out a bit of our new exploding potions-,"

"And we may have caused a bit of a mess."

"But," said Fred, "we did it all for you Gin."

"By way of apology," said George.

"I wouldn't say apology," said Fred.

"Too strong a word?"

"A bit."

"By way of showing that we accept your decision."

"Nice wording."

"Thanks."

Ginny smiled and shook her head. "Thanks, Fred, George," she said, giving them hugs.

"Wrong way," said Fred. "I'm George."

Ginny stopped and stepped back, studying them.

Draco spoke up. "Liar."

The three turned to him and he smirked, pointing to Fred. "You're Fred."

"How do you know?" asked Fred.

"I'm Fred," said George.

"You're George," said Draco. "Your freckles are slightly more concentrated on your nose."

The twins looked at each other.

"No, they aren't," they said.

"Seriously?" asked Ginny. "Let me see."

"No!" they both cried, covering their noses and running up to their room to see if Draco was right.

"You notice freckle concentration?" asked Ginny, turning to Draco. He smirked.

"No. I just though that might get them to leave."

"You're evil."

"Most likely," said Draco.

"So how do you tell them apart?"

Draco shrugged. "Just do. How about you?"

"Same," she said.

He held open the door so she could go in and then followed her into the hall.

The twins had been right. They had unleashed dung bombs in the house, and it smelled of smoke. Ginny scrunched her nose.

"What did they do, burn the house down?"

Draco peered into the dining room to see the charred remains of the once large table. Most of the adults were standing around it, trying to clean up the mess and clear the air. He ducked back into the hall.

"Just the dining room table," he said, and then took Ginny's coat from her to hang it in the closet.

"And who said chivalry was dead?" Ginny asked.

"Ginny?" asked Mrs. Weasley, obviously hearing her daughter's voice from the hall.

"I'm here," said Ginny, walking over to the doorway and waving.

"Did you have fun?" asked Mrs. Weasley, sounding rather anxious.

"Yes, mum."

"What did you do?"

Ginny leaned behind the wall to whisper to Draco.

"Should I tell them we had wild animal sex, or that we got matching tattoos?"

"Start small," said Draco.

"Ginny? What are you whispering about?" asked Mrs. Weasley.

"Nothing, mum," said Ginny, returning to the doorway. "I was just asking Draco how long he thought we could keep the tats hidden."

"Tats?" asked Mrs. Weasley in alarm. "You got a tattoo?"

"I was joking," said Ginny, rolling her eyes to Draco.

"That's not funny, Ginny. Now, come on in here, and help me get this cleaned up."

Ginny walked into the dining room, and he followed, lingering at the doorway as Charlie began levitating the remains of the table out of the room and Ginny took the magical mop from her mother. Mr. Weasley was clearing the air with a few spells and they all looked over at him.

He shifted. "Did you need any more help?" he asked, trying to be considerate and helpful.

"I think we've got it all covered, but thank you," said Mrs. Weasley, giving him a smile that was forced, but not entirely so. "Albus and Kingsley are in your study."

Draco nodded and then walked down the hall. Kingsley had left after lunch to see if he could gather a list of the recent raids on the families who could afford to buy the goblet. He didn't think the Auror would be back so quickly though.

Dumbledore and Kingsley were looking over the file when he walked in. Bill was there as well, holding Lukas in his arms. The infant was awake and staring.

"Hey," said Bill. "Have fun?"

He was interested, yes, but not prying. He was a welcome relief from the rest of the red-haired family.

"It was fine," he said.

"Fine," Kingsley snorted.

Draco rolled his eyes. "Who's on the sheet?"

"We have five families who would have been able to buy the goblet who have had raids in the past year alone."

"I think we can count out those families," said Draco.

"Why?" asked Bill.

"If they've been raided recently, they're probably Death Eaters since the Ministry is finally taking a proactive stance against the Dark Lord. No Death Eater would have the Horcrux; the Dark Lord would have already made sure of that. We need to look for a raid taking place right after the fall, around fifteen years ago. That's when the first theft would have taken place. Maybe we can trace it from there."

Kingsley pulled out another sheet. "This is just a list of the raids occurring in the past fifteen years. I can't get anything more detailed without proper clearance." He put it on the table. Draco leaned over it, as did Dumbledore. He scanned over the names.

"I didn't count some of these families," he said. "Some have completely died out since the fall. The Gerard's, for one."

He frowned, turning over a few thoughts in his head.

"Any ideas?" asked Dumbledore.

"A few," said Draco. "If we assume that the Maruska's were the first to steal it back, the thief they hired could have talked, spreading that rumor around. I can but this into an equation, rate the factors for stealing the goblet and finding which one matches. Might take a while."

"How long is a while?" asked Kingsley.

"Two, three hours," said Draco. "I know most of these families, but I could use a more detailed profile on a few."

"I can get you that," said Kingsley.

Draco nodded. "I'll need it on the Balfour's, the Lowry's, the Ringgold's and the Winchcombe's."

"I'll get right on that." Kingsley nodded and left the room.

Draco turned back to the page, already working through the algorithms even as he picked up the quill. He raised his eyebrows at Dumbledore and Bill. They laughed and left the room as well, leaving him to blessed quiet.

"Hey," said Bill, finding his sister in the drawing room. She was reading a magazine, Witch Weekly, so it must have been Hermione's. Ginny had never been one for gossip columns.

"Hey," said Ginny.

"What are you doing up here?"

"Hiding."

"From?"

"People."

She sat up, and patted the couch next to her. Bill sat and then Ginny held out her arms for Lukas. Bill transferred his son to Ginny's hands and smiled at the way she held the boy perfectly. She was more like Molly Weasley than she liked to admit.

Lukas looked upset at the initial transfer, having just dozed off, but Ginny shushed him, rocking him gently and Lukas decided she wasn't so bad after all and closed his eyes again.

"How was your date?" asked Bill.

"That was actually the reason I was hiding," said Ginny. "I wanted to have girl-talk with Hermione, but she's out with Harry and Ron."

Her tone said that this was a discretion that she was not going to let go.

"Talk to me," said Bill. "Who's your favorite oldest brother?"

Ginny smiled and sat back, shifting Lukas to a more comfortable position.

"I had fun," she said.

"That's always a good sign."

"It was relaxed, not like a lot of first dates. At least, I was relaxed, I think he was a little tense."

"Your send off probably didn't help all that much," said Bill.

"Not at all," said Ginny. "Still, I think Fred and George are being reconciled to the fact that their sister is dating a Malfoy. I think mum is still a little wary, dad too."

"You have to realize that it's normal for them to worry," said Bill.

"I know," said Ginny. "I just think their being a bit…paranoid. I mean, Draco's only saved our lives how many times now?"

Bill laughed. "Yes, one would think that would make up for a grievous amount of wrong, but it was only last year all of you were complaining about him. Give mum and dad sometime."

Ginny sighed, but nodded.

"So, what did you do?" asked Bill.

Ginny gave him a look. "You may have long hair, but this is purely girl-talk. Especially because you're all brotherly with him."

"Alright," said Bill, "I understand."

"What did he say about it?" asked Ginny.

"Oh, so I can tell you what he said, but you won't tell me?"

"Something like it."

Bill shrugged. "He said it was fine, but you know Draco. He wouldn't say either way. I think that's something you'd have to find out for yourself. Shouldn't you know if he was horribly bored by it, though?"

"I don't think he was," said Ginny. "I just don't know if he had fun."

"I don't think you're going to be able to tell a lot of things about him," said Bill.

"I know."

"I mean, if you're having second thoughts-,"

"What?" asked Ginny. "No, not at all. I just want to get to the stage where I can read him a little better, or to the point where he's a little more forth coming with his thoughts."

"I can understand that," said Bill.

"How did you get to know him so well?"

"Well, I think I was at a bit of advantage. I was the only one who figured him out, and he was caught off guard, so I think he let more slip than he actually attended. He also said that I reminded him of Lukas. You're going to have a harder time because you are dating him. He doesn't let girls get close to him."

"Because he hates his mother," said Ginny, giving a nod.

Bill raised his eyebrows. "He told you that?"

"He let it slip, and he seemed adamant enough about it."

"From what I understand, Narcissa is, well, loose and apparently Lucius holds some regard for her. He would have to like her at least somewhat, I mean, when I heard she was fooling around so openly, I thought for sure Lucius would ill her, but there you have it."

"I knew it was something like that," said Ginny. "I talked to Blaise before break about Draco, hoping to gain a few insights."

"Think it will be enough?" asked Bill.

Ginny shrugged. "I hope so."

Bill checked on Draco's progress half an hour before dinner. Draco was leaning over the table full of papers and his brow was knit. He didn't look up when Bill came in, so Bill cleared his throat. Still no response.

"Draco," said Bill.

Draco's head shot up, hand starting for his wand, but he recognized Bill in half a second.

"Hey," he said, going back to his work.

"How's it going?" asked Bill, coming over to look at the papers.

"Badly," said Draco, making a few more notes on a page before shuffling through the stack. "There's more information than I first thought, which normally is a good thing because it means I can make a more detailed analysis, but in this case it means that there is an entire slew of new possibilities. I've tried mapping them out, on the basis that the Marsuka's were the first to reclaim the goblet, but from there, at least four families could have stolen it next, and each of those four have any number who could have grabbed it, and so on."

"Is there anyway you could narrow down the possibilities?" asked Bill.

The door opened and Dumbledore and Kingsley entered. Kingsley raised his eyes at the amount of papers; Dumbledore gave a small smile.

"I take it you have run into a few unforeseen obstacles?" he asked.

Draco rolled his eyes; Bill explained the situation.

"What would you need to cut down the possibilities?" asked Kingsley, echoing Bill's question from before.

Draco shrugged and pulled out a particularly large sheet of paper. There were eighteen names on the sheet and different colored intersecting lines were drawn to represent the possible change of hands. It appeared to be one large mess.

"Right here," he said, pointing to a name with several of the colored lines ending at it. "The Fortescue's. A dark family, known for their eccentricities. They haven't joined the Dark Lord because they don't necessarily believe in any causes. The Dark Lord can't force their hand either, because if anyone of them is harmed or held as blackmail, they will do everything in their power to get revenge. They are known for their suicide attacks in such cases, taking out a dozen men and sacrificing themselves."

"And they're one of your suspects," said Bill.

"They have miserly tendencies," said Draco. "They couldn't resist an ancient, powerful artifact. Either it's there, or it isn't. Either way it would help."

"How would you eliminate them?" asked Kingsley.

Bill saw Draco pause, and then glance in his direction before giving a nonchalant shrug.

"Check their safe," he said.

It took a minute for his implication to sink in.

"No," said Bill. "Absolutely not."

"Why not?" asked Draco.

"You just told us that these people are creeps! I'm not going to let you break into their house and get caught."

"I'm not going to get caught. I've done this before."

"Before when you were on the bad guy's good side," said Bill. He ignored Kingsley's snort at his choice of phrasing. "Draco, it's too risky."

"But it would be during a raid," said Draco.

"He has a point," said Kingsley. "If I were on the raiding party, I could buy him time, make sure that he was relatively uninterrupted."

"Happy now?" asked Draco, turning to Bill.

Bill paused. He would feel better if Kingsley was there as well, but he wasn't entirely convinced. He turned to Dumbledore. "What do you think?"

Dumbledore stroked his beard. "How certain are you that the operation would run smoothly?" he asked Draco. "No false assertions, I want you to actually consider this."

"I'm not saying it wouldn't be tricky," said Draco. "But the family is older and reclusive. They will be using strong wards, but ancient ones. There are a lot of ways to get by them with the advances in magical spells. I could probably even tell if and when the safe had been broken into last, which would more than halve my suspect list. If Kingsley can buy me time, it should go without a hitch."

Dumbledore nodded. "Then I believe it should be attempted. Kingsley, when would you be able to schedule a raid?"

"A week at the least," said Kingsley.

"That long?" asked Draco. "Can't we just leave a tip to clue them in on possible illegal activities?"

"The Fortescue's are being raided tonight under suspicion of housing Azkaban escapees," said Kingsley. "I'm not on the team, and given the nature of the raid, it is going to be one of the more thorough searches. Henderson's is heading it, and his group has the tendency to hex first and ask questions later. The strength of the curses he uses isn't necessarily warranted. It would be best to wait for next week."

"Next week could be too late," said Draco.

"If there isn't another raid, it's not going to go anywhere," said Dumbledore. "It would be best to wait on this one. We can't afford any casualties."

"But-,"

"Draco," said the Headmaster. "It is the best course of action to wait and we will do so."

His tone was gentle, but firm. Draco wasn't happy with the restrictions and it showed. Still, he clenched his jaw and nodded.

"Now," said Dumbledore jovially, "I do believe it is time for dinner and it smells delicious. No doubt all of that plotting has made you hungry, eh Draco?"

Bill thought the Headmaster was overdoing it. Draco appeared to agree because his face went blank and his eyes went cold.

Bill gave him a sympathetic smile as they filtered out to the kitchen, but Draco didn't appear mollified. Ginny seemed to realize something was wrong as well because she sat right next to Draco, her head tilted to the side, expression quizzical.

Bill didn't catch the conversation, because he was sitting with Fleur on the other side of the table, the new one that Fred and George had bought after destroying the first, but he did see Ginny talking and he saw Draco's lips twitch up slightly at whatever she had said. Draco responded, she laughed, and then brushed his arm reassuringly.

Satisfied that Ginny would see to her boyfriend, oh Merlin, was that a weird concept, he turned to Fleur and gave her a peck on the cheek.

After dinner Bill helped Draco move his stuff into the empty room on the third floor. He understood this concern of his father's completely, and Draco did as well. He couldn't help but notice that Draco seemed much more at ease after eating with Ginny. He didn't think Draco would appreciate him commenting on it.

"Seriously," he said, looking into the boy's wardrobe, "how many outfits do you need? You're like a girl you have so much stuff."

Draco snorted. "You try living in the media and you'll find out."

"What, they memorize the clothes you wear?" asked Bill.

Draco stared at him as if it were basic knowledge. "It's kind of what they do. If you wear an outfit to a publicized board meeting, and wear it again in the space of a month, they are all over it, and I was just the kid tag-a-long. Try being one of the members."

"So you got a new outfit for every day?" asked Bill.

"Not anymore," said Draco. "I'm on a budget."

Bill glanced sideways at the boy before seeing the smirk.

"So now it's just an outfit for every day of the year," he said, carrying on the banter.

"And a month or so extra incase of emergencies," Draco agreed.

Bill tossed a pair of socks at his head. Draco ducked and then waved his wand, sending his clothes upstairs to his new room.

"That's one way to do it," said Bill, impressed at the method and that Draco had gotten every item in one go. He spotted the picture on the nightstand and crossed over, picking the silver frame up. He stared.

A tiny Draco was clinging to the back of a young man with yellow-blond hair and bright blue eyes. The young man was laughing and waving, the young Draco was waving as well, a bright smile on his face. They were in a park of sorts, and it must have been Muggle because they were wearing jeans and t-shirts.

"When was this?" asked Bill, turning to Draco who glanced over from putting a few miscellaneous objects into his trunk.

"A little over ten years ago," he said.

"He looks nice," said Bill. "You look happy."

Draco shrugged. Bill looked back down before handing the picture to Draco. For a minute he could have sworn Lukas was looking right at him as he grinned.

So now that the D/G is well on it's way, we can start getting back to the action, starting next chapter. Woo-hoo! Please leave a review.





12. A Run In During a Break In

Disclaimer: If I owned Harry Potter, I would sleep until eleven every morning. I'm currently sleep deprived. I do not own Harry Potter.

Author's note: I know, I've fifty-three minutes late AND I didn't reply to reviews. BUT, I have a lot of tests AND this chapter contains a lot of action, SO you should forgive me, read the chapter, AND enjoy it!

Draco was about to go to bed when the owl came. He had been in his study, trying to tweak his algorithm in hopes to cut down on his suspect list, but to no avail. He had just left the room, giving up for the night, when the owl appeared through the Floo.

It wasn't a real owl, because the house had several wards up which didn't allow anyone but Order members contact, but one made of magic. Its sole purpose was to send a message, secretly, without any prying eyes or tracking charms. The owl flew straight to him and disappeared, dropping a letter into his hands.

He slipped his finger under the anonymous seal and opened the letter, immediately recognizing the handwriting.

I thought you would be interested in knowing that Theodore Nott left a tip at the Ministry yesterday about escapees hiding out at the Fortescue's place. Someone we both know wants to peek in. I'm bored to death over here. Any chance I could join you?

Kisses, Pansy

Draco had to smirk. Only Pansy would leave because she was bored.

He didn't think it was a trap. If it had been someone, say Theodore Nott Jr., he would have known immediately that it was just an ambush, but Pansy was different. She was smart, observant, and could be extremely philosophical at times. No doubt she had realized the incongruence of the Dark Lord's doctrine before he had even considered leaving, but she wouldn't leave unless she was absolutely sure she could get away with defecting. He wondered how much money she had managed to skim off the top while working in the Ministry.

He was happy to hear that she was leaving. He was not pleased with the information she had sent. There would only be one reason for Nott to leave the tip about the Fortescue's Manor, and that was if the Dark Lord was planning on sending in his own thief to raid the safe. If the goblet was there, which Draco doubted because he was nearly seventy percent sure that an Erus Feles had made off with the cup, then the Dark Lord would have his final Horcrux. If it wasn't, than the Feles could still gather a lot of data for the Dark Lord, such as when was the last time the safe was broken into and if a specific signature was left.

Draco had to get in that safe before the Dark Lord did.

He didn't even think of informing Bill or Dumbledore about this. If they were so against him going, than they wouldn't have to know he was gone. He went back to his study to grab his knife and then walked up to his new room on the third floor, as if he was going to bed, and changed into a set of plain black robes. He pulled a knit cap over his head, exchanged his legal wand for his unregistered one, and cast the silencing spell before he Apparated. Really, it was too easy.

He appeared in the center of Diagon Alley. It wasn't busy at this time of night, but there were a few pubs open with patrons. A few love-struck couples were wandering around the town.

He walked straight to the Public Library of Wizarding Britain, a large, marble building with nearly every wizarding text in the world as well as an entire floor dedicated to the old archives. The Library was always open, and even tonight, there were a few witches milling about, looking in the love potion section.

Draco walked up the curving staircase to the archives, skipping past the census and statistic section until he reached the door leading to the offices. All old homes were documented, the blue prints held in the Library vault where they were kept for official and emergency use, which meant Auror raids and the off-chance of a magical implosion, which could happen if the magic in the houses wasn't inspected every year.

He pulled out his wand, checked behind him quickly, and unlocked the door. He slipped through, making sure to lock the door behind him, and then stole silently down the hall. The door he wanted was on the far left and he had to unlock that one as well. During normal work hours, these offices were occupied, but as it was, Draco entered unchallenged and strode right over to the large shelf that took up the entire back row. It looked like a wine cabinet, but instead of holding bottles, it held large, rolled-up parchments with the architectural designs. He found the Fortescue blueprint and pulled it out, unrolling the parchment on the desk. He scanned the outline, knowing that he wouldn't find the safe labeling, but taking note of the position of the rooms and exits.

He rolled the parchment back up after only a minute, which was all he needed. He replaced the sketch and then left. Once he was out in the street, he Apparated again.

He appeared in his flat and wondered what Bill was going to say when he came back. Draco walked to his bedroom and flipped on the radio beside his bed that was tuned to the Auror frequency, something highly illegal. He listened to the reports as he pulled open his closet, making sure the raid wasn't starting without him.

The items he needed were hanging in the back of his closet. He changed quickly into the black trousers and long-sleeved black shirt. They looked ordinary enough, but the trousers were leather, charmed to be just as flexible as they were durable, and the shirt was a thick silk blend. Both items had several spells woven throughout, charms that caused unsuspecting eyes to slide over the material as well as muffling the brush of fabric.

The clothes had been expensive, but the supple, black-leather boots he pulled on next were even more so. A pair of thin black gloves were next, and lastly a the black cap that he shoved over his white-blond locks.

On the radio, he could hear the Aurors announcing their arrival at the Fortescue Manor and he flipped the receiver off. One last check to make sure he had everything he needed, and then he Apparated.

He arrived at the back of the Manor, right beyond the wards. The mansion was located on top of a gentle hill, with a perfectly kept lawn and drive. There were woods at the base of the hill in the back, providing ample cover from the Aurors who were gathering in the street below, but Draco still had to get up to the house, hopefully before the Aurors decided to enter. The Feles would enter with the rush of Aurors; he wanted to get there first.

He picked up a twig and walked towards the house, stopping just before the tree line ended. He tossed the twig.

The night was clear and cold, and the moon was bright. He could see the twig sail through the air, hitch ever-so-slightly, and there was a faint shimmer and then the twig landed into the lawn. It was unharmed.

Draco picked up a larger stick and extended it, taking a step forward and noting how the end of the stick glowed when it passed through the shield. It was a good shield, but not completely Erus Feles proof. He cast a charm on himself, one that temporarily turned his blood cold, which was not a particularly safe spell to use, but this was only going to take a minute.

Ignoring the freezing sensation, he stepped forward until he was on the edge of the ward, and then turned backwards. He leveled his wand at himself and said, 'Stupefy'.

The curse threw him backwards, even as unconsciousness took hold, and then he was hitting the shield and passing through it. The shield read his body temperature, and his lack of mental thought, and let him pass. The effect of passing through the shield pulled him back into consciousness even as he landed on the soft grass. He immediately ended the cold curse, breathing in relief once his blood returned to a normal temperature. He hated using that spell.

He rolled over onto his stomach, picking his head up to make sure that he was still alone on this side of the house and then got to his feet. He ran swiftly, lowly, to the building, getting into the shadow just as he saw a few Aurors slipping around to the back of the Manor to set up a guard there, just incase anyone tried to run.

Draco crept to one of the back doors and aimed a few, dark unlocking spells at the latch. The spells sparked slightly and he froze, glancing in the direction of the Aurors, but no one made a move to stop him. He continued, pulling the door open carefully, and then reaching out, feeling for another ward, but there wasn't. He stepped inside and slide the door shut.

It was dark inside, the moonlight being blocked by heavy drapes on the windows, only piercing through between the thin slivers where the drapes weren't pulled together. There were spells and potions a wizard could use to see in areas of limited light, but Draco avoided these. A side effect was increased sensitivity to light to such an extreme level so that even the spark of spells was blinding.

He allowed his eyes to adjust in the dark and mentally reviewed the blueprints of the mansion. There was a faint flicker up ahead of a wall torch, in the hall, and he started forward. The best place to store a safe was somewhere innocent, in the child's room, for example, but the Fortescue's were violently protective of their family and wouldn't stoop as low as the Death Eaters. They would most likely place it in the wine cellar or a disguised guest room.

Draco had seen the layouts of the castle, and seen how one guest room was situated right above a small drawing room that faced the back of the estate. He guessed the safe was somewhere between the two floors, an entrance in both the guest and drawing room, to allow for a quick escape. He needed to get into that drawing room before the Aurors entered.

He walked silently down the hall, taking the first right he came across and entering another corridor. The room was the third on the left, and he crept in just as the front door burst open. The entire house was bathed in a bright, white light and a projected voice could be heard through every room, even as the Aurors piled into the home, splitting into groups and banging open doors.

"Attention residents and staff, this is the Auror Department. Lay your wands down and do not attempt to resist. This is a legal, and authorized, raid on your home."

Draco shut the drawing room door and risked a light spell on his wand. He looked up at the ceiling, scouring the painted and sculpted surface for any detail of a trapdoor or entrance. The Aurors would have dropped all of the wards, meaning that while the safe would still be protected, the disguising charms would have dropped.

There. On the ceiling above the fireplace was the image of King Astephalon and Mage Corrings meeting in the Halls of Justice, except the two of them were born a century apart. The king had met with his advisors and, reportedly, the lineage of Cassandra. Draco clamored up on the mantel of the fireplace, having some difficulty because the ledge was narrow and smooth, but he managed to stand.

He tapped on the ceiling, hearing the hollow echo that meant the safe was most definitely right there. He raised both hands and pressed, muttering 'patefacio'.

The familiar dissolving sensation traveled from his finger tips to the rest of his body and his vision went black for a second. The next he found himself standing in front of a large mahogany door paneled with intricate carvings. The door had no handle or latch, and to the side of it was a gold basin on a marble stand.

The basin was where blood relatives could place a drop of their blood to open the door. Draco was not a relation, and he had to hurry because he had a feeling the Dark Lord's thief would be sneaking into the manor with the Aurors.

He noticed the carvings in the marble stand all around the basin, reading the wards that kept the door shut and then smirked. He traced his wand around the basin and muttered the disabling curse. The door slid open. He retraced the etchings, re-enabling the wards and then jumped through the entrance as the door slammed shut. The Nott's had a safe warded just like this one.

Draco stared at his surroundings. He was in a chamber lit by a few, ever-burning torches. The safe was well organized, something most hiding areas weren't, but the Fortesuce's were misers and misers always had to check upon their treasures. Piles of gold and old heirlooms heaped in corners wouldn't exactly make an inventory an easy thing.

Draco walked about the room once, searching for any signs of the goblet. There were several portraits on the wall that had been frozen with magic, making the subjects unable to visit these frames and report on their location. The portraits weren't blank, but holding faint outlines of the subjects. He recognized most of them.

There were mirrors leaning against the walls as well, large ones, enchanted ones that showed glimpses of possible futures and images of past memories, even if the memories were erased or altered by dark magic.

Tables coated in gold and silver were placed in rows, holding diamond encrusted candlesticks and centerpieces of flowers that were actually rubies and emeralds. Underneath the tables were chests overflowing with galleons and other sorts of gold and silver coins from various dynasties. Four ancient wardrobes lined the back walls, their doors open, displaying jewelry boxes with their lids propped open. These held some of the most expensive jewels in all of England: thick ropes of perfectly matching pearls, solid gold armbands that would stretch from wrist to elbow, crowns from every century, and signet rings from old wizarding families, more sacred than any of the above, not because of their jewels, but because of the power they represented.

Most signet rings had been lost, and only a few Pureblood families could flaunt theirs, the Malfoy's being one of them. In the sixteenth century there was an uprising of the peasant class. Most symbols of power (signet rings, coat of arms, crowns, etc) had been stolen, most melted down to make new jewelry, but some had found themselves in the hands of other Pureblood families who kept the rings and shields in their safes collecting dust.

If Draco had not grown up around such splendid wealth, he would have been too caught up in the riches to notice the door opening, but he was a Malfoy. Their own safe was three times the size of this, and he at meals at a table with just as many diamond candlesticks and fake, emerald flowers.

He slipped behind the door of one wardrobe, completely covered by the silver-plated wood. He was in a darker corner, which allowed him to peer out behind the door without worry of being caught.

Two figures entered, one shoved forward by the other, hands bound behind his back. The captive was most likely one of the Fortescue's used to open the door, which was not a move usually taken by a Feles because the Aurors counted the family members to make sure that each was accounted for and not lying in wait in an ambush. The bound man was bleeding, a testament to the purpose of his capture.

"Where is it?" the Feles demanded.

"I don't know!" the man half-sobbed.

That earned him a kick in the ribs. The man doubled over as best he could.

"Don't try my patience! Where is it?"

"I already told you a thousand times. I don't know!"

"Crucio!"

The man screamed, his body convulsing, arms straining against his bonds. Draco didn't even flinch, something which relieved him. He was afraid he was getting a little soft from his association with the Order members.

The curse was ended.

"One more chance to tell me."

The man just sobbed. He was picked up by his shirt collar and flung into a table. He hit with a crack, a rib had been broken. He fell to the floor along with several candlesticks and the clatter of golden plates. The Feles leveled a wand at the man.

"You appear to have out lived your usefulness then. Goodbye."

The Feles began to speak the killing curse, but Draco swung the door away and stepped out, flicking his wand sharply.

"Wha-?" the Feles began, but then Draco caught his wand out of the air and took a step forward into the light.

"Keep your hands in the air," said Draco.

The thief hesitated. Draco gave a short rap of his wand and the man yelled at the sudden sting of fire the curse caused.

"Into the air," Draco repeated.

The thief finally capitulated, glaring from behind his mask. Draco flicked his wand and the mask flew off.

"Edgerton Raines," said Draco. "Why am I actually surprised?"

"Who are you?" Raines demanded, not recognizing him in the dim lighting and without the tell-tale blond of his hair.

"That is a fact you do not need to know," said Draco. "What you should know is that I will kill you right here and right now if you don't obey my instructions to the fullest degree, do you understand?"

"Yes," said Raines, nodding his head, but grudgingly.

"Good," said Draco. "I want you to take the chains off of your prisoner."

"I can't without my wand."

"Don't be ridiculous. You have a key."

Raines grit his teeth and reached into his pocket.

"While you are releasing your hostage, how did a small time petty crook like yourself get into the Fortescue's home?" asked Draco.

"With him," said Raines darkly, jerking his head towards his captive. "He's a Fortescue so the wards let me through."

"You want me to believe that you captured a man all by yourself? Please, you went to Azkaban when you couldn't even break into a pawn shop and accidentally killed the owner because you fell on top of him as you tumbled off the roof. Who gave you the idea of kidnapping a Fortescue?"

Raines had pulled out the key and he looked to Draco, his expression twisted.

"Unlock him," Draco prodded. "And answer my question."

Raines started forward, but then he glanced behind Draco, his eyes fixating on something. Draco whirled around, catching a glimpse of motion from his peripheral vision, but then a large, silver candlestick smashed into his temple and the room exploded into tiny bursts of light.

He was aware that he hit the floor, but vaguely, as if he was in a dream. There were hands pulling away his wand and the wand he had taken from Raines, and then hands were searching his clothing, much more intimately than necessary. He just wanted it to stop so he could sink into the darkness that was welling up from the throbbing in the side of his head.

He was shoved over and consciousness came in bursts. There were voices – darkness. He was propped up against something, his wrists were tied tight – darkness. There was the sound of someone screaming, the captive again – darkness. Darkness – a cold splash on his face. His eyes blinked open and the world was doubling and weaving, but then he blinked again and the world came into focus.

A woman was bent over him, a woman with blonde hair and a too-tight, too-low leather suit with the same features as his own.

"Well, hello there, Draco," said Claire Jameson, her mouth curled in a smug little smile. Her eyes were dilated; she was using a night-vision charm.

"Claire," said Draco, returning the smirk as he took stock of his condition. "What brings you here? Have you shown the Dark Lord that outfit yet?"

"He bought it for me specifically," said Claire, running her hands over the bodice. "And speaking of attire, you're looking quite good yourself, a lot better than the last time I saw you, all bloody and with a hole in your arm."

Draco was leaning against a table leg, his hands tied behind his back around the post. He couldn't move the table, it was simply too heavy and the rope around his wrists were too tight for him to slip out of and even holding still caused his skin to chafe.

"I feel better too," he said, ignoring the fact that his left temple was throbbing and a bit of warm liquid trickled down his cheek and neck.

"That's really good," said Claire, giving him a seductive smile. "Feel up to answering some questions?"

"You'll have to give me a few minutes," said Draco. "My head hurts."

Claire laughed. Draco glanced around to see that Raines was in the corner of the room, tossing artifacts from chests as he searched for the goblet. The hostage was lying a bit further away, looking close to unconsciousness but he was staring at Draco in shock. Draco's hat was off, lying on the ground and the man most likely recognized him as Draco recognized Florean Fortescue, disinherited from his family and owner of the best ice-cream shop in Diagon Alley. He turned back to Claire.

"You kidnapped the nice ice-cream man?" he asked in disbelief and disapproval.

"It was necessary," said Claire.

"Oh come on," said Draco. "You could break into the safe without having family blood. Don't play coy."

"Well yes, I could," said Claire. "But Eddie here couldn't, and I needed a distraction to catch you."

"To catch me," said Draco.

"We know someone from the Ministry contacted you or one of the Order members. I figured that they would send you to investigate, seeing as you are a genius and all. We weren't able to figure out who your contact is, but we'll keep our eyes open. Anyway, I came in with that."

Claire pointed to a silvery piece of material on the floor by Florean Fortescue. It was an invisibility cloak, not as nice as the one belonging to Harry Potter, but it still worked perfectly in low-light conditions, and if the user didn't move about too much.

"Not bad," said Draco.

"Glad you think so," said Claire. "Now, you're going to do me a favor before I drag you back to Voldemort."

"Don't count on it," said Draco.

Claire smiled. "Oh, Draco, I know you will. You see, if you don't, I'm going to put dear-old Florean in some real pain, pain that will prevent him from struggling to scoop out hard ice-cream from large cans for the rest of his life. You wouldn't want that on your conscience, would you? Denying all those cure little kids from having sundaes?"

"Truly," said Draco, in mock awe, "you are more cruel than even I could imagine." He gave a sigh of defeat. "Very well, ask your questions. I shall provide you with answers."

"The correct answers," said Claire. "I'll know if you were lying."

Draco smirked again, his expression darkening. "Don't count on it."

She gave him a challenging smile in return. "I know that you are here in hopes of either finding the goblet, or trying to figure out when it was stolen. I need to know what you've come up with."

"Nothing yet," said Draco. "I didn't have time to check."

"Figure it out now."

"I need to examine the door and for that I need my wand."

"Not a chance."

"Had to try."

"I know, now get down to work before I put the Cruciatus on Fortescue for the fourth time tonight. That might start some irreparable damage."

Draco sighed and let his head fall back against the post of the table. His head was really killing him.

"Cast the prior incantum on the door," he said.

"That's it?" asked Claire.

"No, that's not it," said Draco, rolling his eyes. "Stop asking questions and just do what I say."

"You really aren't in the position to be making demands."

"Of course I am. I have something you need, now cast the spell."

Claire smiled. "I love it when you start ordering me about," she said, licking her lips.

She got up and cast the spell on the door.

"Now what?" she asked.

"Get ready," said Draco. "You have to cast these in quick succession."

He rattled off a list of spells, revealing spells, amplifying spells, signature spells, and a few extra that weren't necessary at all. He had to keep her busy and so he made it as time consuming as possible as he reached for the knife in his pocket, shifting and straining against his bonds. Raines wasn't a problem. He was too over-whelmed with the magnitude of the jewels to pay any attention.

"Now," said Draco, finally managing to pull the knife out and hold it behind the table leg. "Prior incantum again."

Claire did so and lines of magic appeared on the door in different colors and intensities. Draco sawed at the rope, trying to cut the bonds more than his fingers, but to his surprise, even when the blade slipped, he just felt cold steel, not the thin fire of a cut. In contrast, the rope fell away like it was yarn. He kept his hands behind his back as Claire turned to him.

"What does it mean?" she asked, gesturing to the faint marks on the door.

The marks were lines of different colored spells, the age in direct proportion to how brightly they were lit.

"Five years ago," said Draco.

"What?" asked Claire.

"Five years ago was when this safe was last broken into. Look at the blue lines, see how they crisscross the door?"

"What does it mean?"

"It's a ward-breaker. You're going to have to let me up so I can examine it more closely."

"I am going to examine it," said Claire. "You are going to tell me what I am looking for."

"Patterns within the lines," said Draco. "Like grains of wood."

"I see it," said Claire. "Ripples, extending out from the start of the line. What does it mean?"

"That's a spell most commonly used on tombs," said Draco. "You're looking for a Feles who once was involved in tomb-raiding."

"Five years ago," repeated Claire.

"Five years ago," agreed Draco.

He lied. That spell wouldn't have worked on that door. The blue lines were just the residue left over from a failed attempt. The other marks were over twenty years old, before the horcrux had been a horcrux. It had never been here.

"Alright," said Claire, "let's get you to Voldemort. Don't you even think about trying anything, or I'll kill Florean, got that?"

"Yeah, sure," said Draco.

"Raines," Claire ordered, "bring him." She jerked her head at Draco.

"What about the other one?"

Claire glanced over at Florean and shrugged. "Leave him here. He can find his own way out or rot."

Draco knew Florean wouldn't be able to get out. He wasn't the patriarch of the family, meaning he could get in, but not out without proper allowance. It was a tactic used to prevent theft in the family. Florean knew that too and he tried to get up, tried to speak. Claire pointed her wand at him.

"Crucio."

Florean screamed just as Raines came over to Draco. The man was distracted with the torture, and with the very expensive looking vase of emerald-stemmed roses cut from rubies the size of a child's hand. He cast the untying charm, which did nothing because the ropes were already cut and bent down to jerk Draco to his feet. Draco allowed the man to pull him up, but then he moved, grabbing Raines' arm and twisting, forcing it behind the man's back. He had his knife to the man's throat before the thief knew what was happening.

He took the man's wand and Claire cut the curse on Florean, turning to Draco, eyebrows raised.

"You underestimate me," said Draco. "Drop your wand."

"Or what?" asked Claire. "Are you going to kill him?"

"If you don't cooperate, then yes."

Raines whimpered.

"Alright," said Claire, lowering her wand a fraction. "Let's see what we can work out."

"How about you leave the way you came, right now, taking nothing with you," said Draco.

Claire laughed and whipped her wand towards Draco. "Avada Kedavra!"

Of course, Draco was covered by Raines, but to Claire, the other man was just a tool and she needed him out of the way to get to Draco.

As soon as the word was forming, Draco was shoving Raines away and jumping back behind a gold statue of an Egyptian seer. Raines tried to run, but he wasn't fast enough. The green light hit him and he fell. Draco swore, clutching the man's wand in his right hand, knife in his left.

"Aren't you forgetting something, Draco?" asked Claire. "I still have Florean. Drop your wand and knife and come out."

"Lux immortalis," Draco whispered, shutting his eyes tightly. Even so, he could still see red through his eyelids as the white light streamed from his wand.

He could hear Claire's scream and he immediately ran for Florean, his eyes still squeezed shut but calling up the image of the room in his mind, noting the position of every table and coin and trying to be as silent as possible. Claire was screaming off curses now, magic ricocheting across tables and walls, but the pain from the light and her night vision kept her staggering.

While Draco had perfect memory of the room, he wasn't exactly sure how large his steps were and so he fumbled a bit for the ice-cream vendor. Florean hadn't had night vision and so while the light had temporarily blinded him, there was no pain. The man was conscious enough to let Draco help him over to the side of a room behind a large chest.

Draco counted to ten before cracking his left eye open. The light had died out and he opened his eyes completely, turning to see Claire reaching for a table, eyes squeezed shut.

Draco waved his, or rather, Raines', wand and Claire's wand and his own flew from Claire's fingers to his hand. She jerked, eyes open but not focusing on anything.

"You haven't won," she said.

"Seems to me like I did. I lived, rescued the hostage, and one of the bad guys is dead," said Draco.

She sneered and plunged her hand into her pocket. She was whisked away by Portkey.

Draco turned to Florean, easing the man onto an ornate half-throne by the wall.

"Hold still for a second," he said. "This may sting just a bit."

He cast the cure for the blindness and Florean stiffened but then blinked, his eyes latching onto Draco's face.

"Is she gone?"

"Yeah, she had a Portkey."

"Are you alright?"

Draco quirked an eyebrow. "Shouldn't I be asking you that?"

"Your head is bleeding."

"It's fine. How are you doing?"

Florean hesitated before answer. "I'll live," he said carefully.

Draco smirked. "Good answer."

He crossed back over to the door and cast the counter to the ward that kept unexpected visitors in. He left it open as he crossed to the trapdoor at the floor and picked up the top before letting it shut again. He walked back in.

"Aurors are still here," he said. "We'll have to wait a bit before leaving, if that's alright with you. I couldn't create a Portkey in these wards and I'm pretty sure Apparating isn't an option. Can you hold on for a while longer?"

"You aren't with the Aurors?"

Draco snorted.

"With Dumbledore and his group then?" asked Florean. "I've heard rumors."

"Yes and no," Draco hedged.

Florean nodded. "I wouldn't have thought it, if not for tonight. Thank you."

Draco shrugged a shoulder.

"If there's anything I can do for you," said Florean, "ever, just let me know."

"Actually," said Draco, "there is something." He walked over to the wardrobe on the far left and plucked and ruby and signet ring from the holder. "Mind if I return this to the original owners?"

Florean shook his head. "Not at all."

It took two hours for the Aurors to leave, and then Draco helped Florean out of his childhood home. He dropped him off at St. Mungo's, not staying to be recognized and then, after making sure his hat was covering the bloodstains on his cheek, stopped at the Post Office to send Pansy a letter warning her that the Dark Lord was aware of her activities. He charmed it to be unreadable to anyone but her.

By then, it was early morning, going past seven. Draco hoped he wasn't missed yet, but if he was quick, he could stop off at his flat to clean up and see to his head before making a Portkey back to his room. He was familiar enough with the wards on the house for that, but Apparating in was still an impossibility.

Draco had never been happier to see his flat, and he walked straight to the bathroom, pulling off his hat, before backtracking to the kitchen where he had seen, but not immediately registered, the parchment lying on his table. The writing was Bill's.

"Shit," he said, and picked it up, reading the 'You are in such trouble' before the Portkey took hold of him. "Shit," he said again as he was pulled into the dining room of the Order of the Phoenix.

Bill was waiting at the dining room table, had been since five that morning. He and Fleur had moved themselves into Draco's old room, to give the living room back to the rest of the house, and Lukas still wasn't sleeping all the way through the night. It had been Bill's turn to get their son, and afterwards he hadn't been able to sleep.

He had gone downstairs and wandered into Draco's study, intent on looking over the Runes again when he had noticed the knife was missing from its usual place on the bookshelf. He hadn't thought much of it, but for some reason, he had felt uneasy.

He walked back up to Draco's new room on the third floor and unlocked the door. Draco wasn't there.

Bill had immediately informed Dumbledore, who had come right over, and they had been waiting ever since. Kingsley and Sirius had come down at six-thirty and been filled in, and now Bill was just waiting, trying to keep from glancing at the clock every twenty seconds.

He had just taken a sip of the coffee Kingsley had placed in front of him when Draco appeared, stepping quickly to catch his balance, obviously not prepared for the Portkey. Draco turned, taking in the gathered faces. Bill took in the bruise on the side of Draco's face.

"Shit," Draco groaned, running a hand over his face. He looked to Bill again, sighed, and dropped into a chair. "Well?" he asked belligerently. "Go ahead. Lecture."

To Bill's left, Sirius let out a smothered chuckle and Kingsley suppressed a grin. Dumbledore twinkled and Bill and Draco. Bill got up and walked into the kitchen, knowing that lecturing Draco right then would just make the kid defensive. He came back a few minutes later with a cup of tea and a breakfast plate.

"Hungry?" he asked Draco.

Draco hesitated, his eyes scanning Bill's features as if to see when the reprimand was going to come. Bill set the food down in front of the teen and then pulled up a chair.

"What did you do to your head?" he asked, pushing the white strands aside so he could ascertain the damage.

"I did nothing," said Draco, flinching away from his touch and stabbing at a tomato on his plate. "I got hit with a candlestick."

"And how did that happen?"

Draco shrugged. "You want me to explain now or do you want to yell first?"

"I'm not going to yell," said Bill. "I am going to tell you that I was very, very worried and that I found my first grey hair today."

His tone was light, but serious. Draco shifted, fiddling with the food on his plate.

"Dumbledore," said Bill, "has a few words about following orders that you need to listen to."

Bill saw Draco glance up to the Headmaster before returning his gaze to his plate.

"We did not wish you to go for good reason, Draco," he began.

"Something came up," said Draco, interrupting. "I got a letter saying that Nott was the one who had made the tip, which mean the Dark Lord was searching for the Horcrux. If it had been there, he would have taken it."

Bill frowned. "Who told you-?"

"Someone," said Draco. "I'm not free to give a name just yet."

"Why didn't you share this with us?" asked Dumbledore. "We understand the need for privacy and would not have questioned your contact."

"Because you were completely against the idea from the start."

"We weren't against the idea," said Bill. "We were against sending you in last minute without proper back up."

"William is right," said Dumbledore. "Had you come to us with this information we would have agreed with your assessment, that immediate action was necessary. I have certain strings I can pull at the Ministry, one's which would have protected you. Just because we do not agree with you upon every occasion, does not mean we cannot determine between unacceptable and acceptable risk. I have been doing this for quite some time before you were born, and I think you need to start trusting us some more, hmm?"

Bill turned to Draco, seeing the pale flush of his cheeks. Draco nodded.

"We only want to keep you as safe as possible," said Dumbledore, the sparkle returning to his eyes. "Now, it seems you have quite the adventure to tell us."

The white-blond gave a half-shrug and looked up, noting how Sirius and Kingsley had both leaned in , obviously quite interested in the events that had transpired. Draco seemed a little thrown by their interest, but he shrugged again.

"I got the letter last night which said Nott was the one who had given the tip, so I knew the Dark Lord would be looking for his Horcrux. I went to the library to look over the blueprints and stopped at my flat to get my things."

He was obviously referring to his outfit. He looked as if he could be part of a rock band.

"Getting in the house was easy enough, and I managed to get into the safe before the Erus Feles. I made certain that the Horcrux wasn't there and then the Feles came in, Edgerton Raines. He had Florean Fortescue with him to get in the wards. Florean is disinherited but not disowned so his blood still broke through the wards."

"Wait," said Kingsley. "I know Raines. He's not smart enough to kidnap someone and use their blood for wards."

Draco nodded. "I know. I should have known something was off, but I just figured someone would have told him what to do. I didn't see anyone else, and when Raines made to off Fortescue, I went in. That's when Claire Jameson hit me with a candlestick."

"Claire?" asked Bill, remembering the blonde woman who had turned him over to Voldemort. That was a day he could go without recalling.

Draco grimaced. "Yeah. She had an invisibility cloak, nothing too-fancy and not completely invisible, but it didn't have to be because it was dim in the room."

"What did you do?" asked Sirius, looking completely enthralled in the story.

"Passed out," said Draco. "I woke up tied to a table. I had a knife on me though, so after feeding her some wrong information, I cut myself loose and we had a small skirmish. Raines is dead, Claire hit him with an Avada and then when I blinded her night vision, she Portkeyed out. Fortescue and I had to wait for the Aurors to leave and then I took him to St. Mungo's."

Draco shrugged again, as if it were no big deal. Bill wished he wouldn't. He had been knocked unconscious for Merlin's sake; he could have been taken to Voldemort right then.

"I'm glad you're alright," he told the teen, "but I swear to Merlin, you ever disappear again without proper permission or back up, I'm putting a leash on you, understand?"

Draco rolled his eyes and sipped at his tea before returning to his breakfast. He must be hungry; Bill had never seen him eat so quickly, or so much without complaining.

"I'll have Mum take a look at your head," Bill said, eyeing the impressive bruise. It was a dark blue and had spread from his cheek up to his forehead. The bruise was black over his temple.

"It's fine," said Draco. "Just a mild concussion. I'll set an alarm when I go to bed to wake up every hour or so."

"You will not," said Bill. "I'm going to wake you up myself, but I do want my Mum to look this over."

Draco shook his head. "Bill, it's fine, really."

Bill knew that Draco was skittish around Molly Weasley, and mothers in general, but he didn't realize it was by so much. Or maybe it was just the incident of the Angel-Flight that had him further on edge. Still, Bill's mother had been studying for her Healer's license before she had gotten pregnant with him and he wanted to be sure that Draco was alright.

"If you get me the first aid kit," said Kingsley, "I can check him over and then he can go right to bed. I take required medical seminars every year."

The Auror no doubt remembered that Narcissa had been the one to drug Draco and must understand the teen's reluctance to put himself in the care of another mother.

Bill looked to Draco and the teen gave a short nod.

"Afterwards, straight to bed," said Bill. "I'll wake you up to check on you."

Draco nodded again and then sipped at his tea. Bill looked over when Sirius gave a chuckle, turning to the white-blond.

"You do realize you got taken out by a girl, right?"

Bill laughed along with the rest of the table. The side of Draco's lip quirked up.

Did you find the chapter exciting? Did you find the search for the Horcrux exciting? Did you find Draco in leather pants exciting? If you answer yes for any of the above, please leave a review!





13. An Unexpected Visitor

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a yummy mocha I just made, mmm!

"Hey, Draco."

The voice called him back from blessed unconsciousness but Draco already recognized the voice, recognized there was no threat and so he ignored it.

"Draco."

A hand reached out and shook his shoulder lightly. Draco groaned and rolled over onto his stomach.

"Draco, you need to wake up."

Draco opened his eyes to see Bill crouched by his bed.

"What's your name?" asked Bill, trying to determine if he had any brain damage from the concussion.

Draco closed his eyes and buried his face in the pillow. "Draco Malfoy," he said, voice muffled.

"What day is it?"

"December fifteenth."

"Who's the Minister of Magic?"

"Fudge."

"Good," said Bill. "I'll be back in an hour."

Draco groaned, but fell back asleep as soon as the door was shut. It felt like five minutes later when Bill woke him again. Draco wondered how upset Bill would be if he put up a few locking charms on the door. He knew the mental check was for his own good, but it was more than irritating.

"What day is?" Bill asked.

"Same day as last time," said Draco, burying his face in his pillow.

"Who's the Minister of Magic?"

"Someone who shouldn't be."

"What's your name?"

Draco rolled his eyes, but it didn't do any good. He was staring at his pillowcase. "Even if I didn't know, you've been calling me Draco, so that must be it."

"Good," said Bill. "I'll check on you in another hour."

Draco moaned and rolled onto his side away from Bill.

"You only have yourself to blame," said Bill.

"Yes, because I hit myself with a candlestick," muttered Draco. He fell back asleep and straight into REM. He dreamed a bit about a house he had to break into, but someone kept pulling him back, and every time he turned around, the person disappeared and a candlestick was jabbed into his side. He woke up enough to roll onto his back because the leather trousers he hadn't bothered to take off were a tad uncomfortable to sleep in, but that was all.

The next time he woke up was because a soft hand was running over his arm, gently coaxing him from slumber.

"Hey, Draco? You awake?"

The voice was soft as well and then the hand moved to his shoulder, rubbing gently. He blinked open his eyes to see Ginny kneeling by his bed with a small smile on her face. The smile grew when she saw his eyes open.

"Hi," she said.

"Hey," he said back.

She glanced at a paper in her hand. "What city was the capital of wizarding Persia for the most consecutive years?"

"Are you serious?" asked Draco.

She grinned. "Yup, and I'm not leaving until you answer the questions. Consider it retribution for running off in the middle of the night and risking capture by our kinky ex-student teacher."

"Fair enough," said Draco. "Hysteria has the most consecutive years, but Rend was the capital for the longest time cumulatively."

"Correct," said Ginny. "What are the four types of the blood-rose plant and how do they act differently in a love potion?"

"Coccinus, causes feelings of euphoria; crocus, causes obsession; curalium, causes sexual desire; and candidus causes a dream-like state."

"How many bricks were used to build Cassandra's temple?"

"Eleven million, two hundred thousand and eight."

"I'm impressed," said Ginny.

Draco smirked but then Ginny's smile faded and her eyes darkened. Draco pushed himself up, frowning at the change.

"What's wrong?"

Ginny hesitated before answering.

"I don't want to sound…clingy or overly concerned, and I know that you can take care of yourself, but I don't want to come downstairs to breakfast to find my boyfriend with bruise over half his face and a concussion because he snuck out in the middle of the night without telling anyone and nearly got taken to Voldemort. It's…frightening. I don't want that to happen again."

"So what? You want me to tell you the next time I sneak out to go fight the Dark Lord?" asked Draco, his voice cool because he wasn't used to feeling guilty because of a girl.

Ginny withdrew, he could see it in her eyes even if she hadn't leaned back, moving her hand from the bed. Draco mentally swore.

"I didn't mean it like that," he amended, sitting up completely now, but he sat up too quickly, causing the blood to drain from his head and a bout of dizziness washed over him. He raised a hand to his head, trying to pretend that he was just rubbing his face, but his hand brushed his temple sending a bolt of pain straight through his brain. "Shit!" he hissed.

Ginny immediately reached out to him, sitting on the bed and laying a tentative hand on his shoulder. "You alright?" she asked, trying to pull his hand from his temple so she could see if he had managed to injure himself further.

"I'm fine," said Draco, letting her see the bruise.

She winced sympathetically. "Does it feel any better?"

"Yeah."

There was a pause. Ginny looked over at him and then giggled.

"I can't believe you got brained by Claire Jameson, student teacher extraordinaire."

Draco glared, but that just made her laugh harder, covering her mouth with her hand. Draco rolled his eyes and then shifted so that he was leaning against the headboard of the bed. He drew up his feet so that Ginny could have more room to sit. He was suddenly glad that he hadn't decided to sleep under the covers because he had never been one for such intimacy.

He hadn't changed though and Ginny raised her eyebrows, a small smile tugging at her lips.

"I like the leather," she said, neutrally, but her eyes were sparkling.

He raised his own eyebrow. "Slightly kinky for a Weasley, isn't it?"

"Slightly undignified for a Malfoy, isn't it?" she returned.

He shrugged. "Dignity has its place."

"And tight leather trousers their own?"

"They are not tight," he said.

She looked him over again and, a little unnerved, he tossed a pillow at her head. She caught it and giggled some more.

"Pillow fighting in leather pants? And you said I was kinky?"

Draco had to consciously keep his mind from straying down a path he definitely did not want to travel and he glared at Ginny.

"Indecent woman," he muttered.

She just grinned unrepentantly and hugged the pillow to her chest, shifting to sit cross-legged in front of him.

"I'm glad you saved Florean," she said, suddenly serious again.

"His ice cream is good," Draco agreed.

"That's not what I mean," said Ginny.

He knew; she continued.

"I don't like the idea of you going off and getting hurt or worse, but that doesn't mean I don't agree with what you did."

He shifted, toying with the edge of the blanket.

"I'm not sorry that I went," Draco said. "I know that Bill and Dumbledore would have liked to know, and I understand that now, but that doesn't mean I'm always going to listen to them. I don't think they're always right, or taking enough risks, and if that means I end up taking the risks for them, I'm alright with that." He paused for a moment before looking up at her. "If I did tell you when I was leaving, you couldn't tell, not unless it was clear something went wrong."

"I'm pretty sure they would figure it out by then anyway."

Draco nodded. "Probably." He went back to tugging at the edge of the blanket.

"I wouldn't tell," said Ginny.

He looked up at her, eyebrow raised, question evident.

"I wouldn't," she said again, and he knew she was telling the truth. "I wouldn't like you as much if you always did follow everyone's advice."

He tilted his head to the side before letting a smirk turn the corner of his mouth up.

"You really wouldn't be happy with Potter, would you?" he asked.

She shrugged. "I think I could be happy, but I wouldn't be content. I wouldn't be able to settle after all of this; I'd be bored out of my mind."

Draco stopped his mouth from upturning any further. "I can see that," he said. "Can't explain it yet though."

"Explain what?"

"You're a Weasley. You should be happy with him, but for some reason, some crazy, screwed-up reason, you're not. It's almost like you're-," but then he stopped himself, because he was going to say 'darker', but that didn't seem to fit either. She was, though, but not always, not even most of the time, not even in occasion. He could see that bit of her that set her apart, but she had integrated it with the rest of her personality so that it was fluid, like the glints of gold in her hair that only were noticeable in the candlelight, and were only pronounced directly beside a fire.

"Almost what?" asked Ginny.

Draco shook his head, not sure anymore. For one split second, he wondered if he even wanted to know, but the next instant, the feeling was gone.

"Nothing," he said, and then stifled a yawn.

"You should get some sleep," said Ginny.

"I was sleeping. You woke me up."

She wasn't at all chastised. "Maybe next time you should ask for the backup they would have provided."

"I didn't think they would provide it," said Draco. "If I had known, believe me, I would have taken it." He yawned again.

Ginny tossed the pillow back to him and got up. "I'll leave you to sleep then. Mum says you should be alright if you've been coherent these times, so you can rest easy."

"Appreciate it," said Draco.

She smiled, hesitated for a second, and then stepped close to kiss the side of his mouth. It was quick, and then she was stepping back, blushing slightly. "Sleep well."

And then she was gone and the door was closing behind her. Draco lay back, reaching his hand up to brush where she had kissed before settling into bed. He closed his eyes and drifted off.

When he woke up on his own, he knew not a lot of time had passed. A glance at the clock showed that it was half past noon, and he was bored with bed. He got up, stretching out the kinks in his neck. He decided that sleeping in leather was an experience not to be repeated and quickly shod the charmed clothing. He pulled on a comfortable pair of jeans and a soft t-shirt. It was chilly in the house so he added a tight black jumper and a pair of socks.

He wandered downstairs to find lunch on the table, chicken soup and sandwiches, and the rest of the family eating.

"Nice face," said Ron, kicking out the only empty chair beside him.

"Back at you," said Draco, sliding into the seat.

Fred and George laughed. Charlie laughed as well but was then interrupted by a violent sneeze.

"Eat your soup," said Mrs. Weasley. "And then I want you to take a dose of cold suppressant."

"I'm fine, mum," said Charlie, rolling his eyes to Bill, but good-naturedly.

"And stay away from Lukas. We can't have you getting the baby sick."

"Yes, mum," said Charlie.

Hermione passed Draco the large bowl of soup and he ladled some into his bowl.

"And how about you, Draco?" asked Mrs. Weasley. "How's your head feeling?"

Draco nodded, caught off-guard by the attention. "Better."

She frowned. "It's still a bit swollen. I'm going to get you an anti-swelling cream." And she got up right then.

"I'm fine," said Draco, not wanting to interrupt the meal, and not exactly feeling comfortable with the woman just then. He thought he had his inane apprehension under control, but his mind was overactive, forming connections where there weren't any. It was one of the problems with being a genius, with having a, for all intents and purposes, perfect memory.

Now, every time the Weasley mother offered him food, or gave him medicine, he couldn't help but recall the other moments with his mother, the meals she had given him laced with Angel-Flight. His cravings had faded since his latest interactions with the drug, but that just made him even more wary, fearful of falling to the potion again.

Mrs. Weasley didn't even acknowledge that he had spoken and left to collect the ointment. She was back a moment later, crossing over to Draco.

"Tilt your head up to the light," she said.

"I can do it," said Draco quickly.

"Nonsense," said Mrs. Weasley. "Now tip your head back so I can see your bruise better."

"Really," Draco started, but then she reached out and grasped his chin, tilting his head back and to the side.

There were a few chuckles and snorts at the table. Draco gripped the edge of his chair, letting the rest of his body remain relaxed so no one could tell just how badly he wanted to leave. The only times his mother had touched him had been to prod him forward to the piano during a tea party, or to nudge him out of the way when she was finally making conversation with her target for the day. She had pulled him onto her lap once when he was five for a family photo, the first time he had been allowed to touch her in anyway, the first time he had really met her.

His father was being recognized as one of the most influential private investors in a business journal and he wanted the photo to reflect a perfect life. Narcissa had wanted to one-up the other women in her social circle. The picture had achieved that. Lucius still had it in his study, the photo showing him standing behind Narcissa, proudly, his hand reaching around his wife because right there in the picture was the only time he truly owned her. Narcissa, seated, in flowing pale blue robes with her golden curls falling down her back, a Greek goddess. Draco sitting on her lap, cheeks pink because Narcissa had pinched them moments before to make him look sweeter, his silver eyes large and bright, but on a second glance, far too somber for a boy of five.

He barely felt the painful brush of Mrs. Weasley's fingers over the bruise because all he could feel was the touch, the sweep of her fingers as she pushed his hair to the side. Narcissa had brushed his hair once, unnecessarily. They were in the park because so was Stefan Van Sutton and his toddler daughter. Stefan was a doting father and recent widower. Narcissa played the part of doting mother, unloved by her husband. Draco had been going on seven; he only knew vaguely what his mother was doing but he had enjoyed her attentions for that afternoon.

He had found out a few months later what his mother's intentions had been, and suddenly he felt used, betrayed, and guilty for liking the attention she gave him when she was just hurting Lucius, the parent who actually cared for him. He had hated her ever since.

"There," said Mrs. Weasley stepping away. "All set."

He gave her a curt nod, but was spared having to thank her because the Floo flared to life and Dumbledore stepped through.

"We have another guest," Dumbledore announced, and then stepped aside to allow another figure to pass through, a figure with long black hair, wearing a scandalously short robe and skirt outfit with dangerously high black heals. She tossed her hair back from her head; Draco got to his feet.

"Pansy?" he asked, completely shocked.

"Darling," said Pansy, clicking over to him on her heels. She grabbed his hands and kissed him soundly on the mouth.

Draco was a genius and he noticed several things at the same time. First, Pansy's lips felt good against his own, but wrong. They were suddenly too full, too sticky with lip gloss, and she wasn't Ginny. Secondly, the Weasley family had been shocked when Pansy came through, but now they were aghast. Thirdly, the room was completely silent and he could feel outraged gazes focused on him.

He noticed all of that in less than a second, and then he found the proper motor neurons to contact. He stepped back from this kiss, just as startled as the rest of the Weasleys. Usually Pansy did not initiate physical intimacy before drawing out guidelines for how long she was going to be with him and who she was going after next.

Pansy raised an eyebrow at him, amused at his reaction. There was still a stunned silence in the room, and Draco decided to deal with the most important things first. He looked to Pansy.

"You defected," he said.

She shrugged a shoulder and the sleeve of her outer robe slipped down to reveal the lacy straps of her purple undershirt, though it hardly deserved the name.

"I got your message and figured now was as good a time as any. I'm looking into a flat myself, but my plans aren't completely settled so I talked to the Headmaster and he said I could come on over, if it was alright with Harry." Here Pansy turned, easily spotting Potter's dark hair among the red. "Harry, honey, it is alright if I crash here for a few nights, isn't it? I could sleep on a couch, or just share someone's bed, I don't mind."

The last was accompanied with a suggestive smile and Draco was half-amused, half-uncomfortable at the reactions. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were staring at the girl in shock, Bill was giving Draco a concerned look, Ron was trying not to stare, Fleur looked as if she very much wanted to laugh, as she and Pansy were good friends, and Harry looked distinctly discomfited. Draco avoided looking at Ginny.

"I think we have a room free, actually," he said mumbled, cheeks going red.

"Thank you so much," said Pansy. "I totally owe you one." She gave Harry a wink and then turned back to Draco. "Introduce me?" she asked.

"Of course," said Draco. "Pansy, this is Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. You know Bill and Fleur, their baby is upstairs sleeping."

"You have a baby?" Pansy exclaimed, turning to Fleur. "Boy or girl?"

"Boy," said Fleur. "I'll let you meet him after lunch."

Pansy beamed.

"And that's Charlie, second oldest," said Draco. "And you know the rest, Fred, George, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny," here he finally made eye contact with Ginny who's eyes were darkened, wary at Pansy's arrival. Draco turned back to Pansy, saying delicately, "Ginny and I are dating."

Pansy's eyebrows shot up. "You're what?" asked Pansy, incredulous.

"We're dating," said Ginny, with just enough levity in her voice to tell the other girl that she would not tolerate any indiscretion on her part, but Pansy appeared not to notice. She turned to Draco and squealed. Draco had just enough presence of mind to wrap his arms around her as Pansy launched herself into his arms, but not like she usually did, with one thing in mind. It was almost as if she was celebrating.

"I told you," said Pansy, squeezing him tight. She released him with a chaste kiss on the cheek. "I told you that you needed a nice girl." She smiled again and then pushed by him to hold out her hand to Ginny. "Hi, I am totally not hitting on your boyfriend, I swear, and if I knew I would not have kissed him."

Ginny took her hand hesitantly.

"I've told him he needed a nice girl," said Pansy again. "I hope he isn't too 'Malfoyish' or anything."

In bending to shake Ginny's hand, her shirt gaped and nearly slid right off and she pulled the material up with an unabashed grin.

"Ron," said Mrs. Weasley in a collected voice, "why don't you get our guest another chair from the closet."

Draco took a look at the Weasley family, who were still staring at the girl, and he suddenly felt a pain in his temples that had everything to do with the barely dressed Slytherin girl beside him.

"Oh sweet Merlin," said Pansy, taking the baby from Fleur. "He is adorable. Look at him!"

Pansy loved babies, like any girl, but there was something very bitter-sweet about them. Most likely because they represented things that she probably wouldn't have, a loving husband and time to dote on her own children. The only man Pansy would end up marrying was a rich old bastard who wanted a trophy wife.

She held the baby, rocking him gently and smiling at the bug blue eyes.

"What's his name?" she asked.

"Lukas," said Fleur.

Pansy looked up, arching an eyebrow.

"After Draco's brother," Fleur confirmed. "Draco performed a Caesarian on me during the middle of the magical storm."

"I always knew he was smart," said Pansy. She frowned. "Never knew he was that smart though."

"Aacaa," pronounced the infant in her arms.

Pansy tapped the baby softly on the nose. "We're you talking?" she asked. "We're you talking? Yes, you were. So smart already."

Lukas flailed an arm and she gently took hold of his hand, smiling when the tiny fingers wrapped around her own.

"He's beautiful," she told Fleur.

She held the baby for half an hour more before exploring the house a bit, finding Draco in what was obviously his study. She took in the walls covered in ancient runes and the overflowing bookcase. Draco was bent over the desk, but he looked up when she came in.

"Nice place," said Pansy, leaning up against the doorframe, elongating her frame, her shoulders back. After a while, the posturing was second nature.

"Has its moments," said Draco.

She watched him put the quill down and sit back in his chair. He was in talking mode. She pushed herself off the doorway and sauntered over to the other chair, sitting gracefully and crossing her leg, and her skirt rode high on her leg. She left the door open, just because she didn't want Ginny getting the wrong idea.

"I like her," she said, to break the ice.

"Glad you approve," said Draco blandly.

"Although, I will miss our little trysts," she said, just to see how he would react.

Draco's eyes flickered down, just for a moment. He wasn't proud of his actions, but she merely shrugged. Sex for her had always been something for entertainment. If some people had higher morals, she couldn't care less.

"I hear you had a nice job at the Ministry over break," said Draco.

"Yes," said Pansy. "I was a secretary for a bit for Richard Mortimer in the Treasury department."

"How much did you skim off the top?"

She smiled. "Enough for a comfortable living the rest of my life."

"Of course he'll take the fall for it."

"He's been funding the Death Eaters," said Pansy. "You shouldn't be too upset."

"I'm not," said Draco, giving her a small smirk. He must have already known about Mortimer.

"I've been privy to a few rumors as well," said Pansy. "Dumbledore wants me to relay what I've heard at some Order meeting. I think I should probably skip the part where I had sex with the contacts."

"Might make for an interesting meeting," said Draco.

Pansy laughed, but then shook her head. "I don't know how you do it, Draco. I think if I was staying here over break, I might go mad."

"Still waiting for the day," said Draco.

"Oh, come on," said Pansy. "It has to be exciting for you. I mean, you are dating the Golden Girl of Gryffindor."

"I thought that was Hermione."

"They both fit the bill. But tell me, did her parents freak?"

"I was about to pull my wand."

"Seriously?"

Draco shrugged a shoulder. "It never got that bad, but it hasn't been exactly pleasant."

"Did you think it would be?"

"No," said Draco. "I'm even surprised they relented."

"Of course they did," said Pansy. "Fleur told me all about your wild escapades and life-saving tendencies. Emulating Potter a bit much?"

Draco snorted. "Don't insult me."

"Never," said Pansy.

"Where are you thinking about getting your flat?" asked Draco.

She knew he was asking just so he could check the place out himself. She smiled.

"I'm actually thinking about getting a flat with Blaise."

"Blaise?" asked Draco.

"Yes. His parents are moving back to Italy, but they gave him an option of staying here and they would help pay for a place. I figured he would need some company, and a decorator."

"You aren't-,"

"No," she interrupted. "I'm not interested in Blaise. Besides, the whole reason he's staying is for his girlfriend."

"Girlfriend?"

"You haven't talked to Blaise in a while, have you?" Pansy asked.

"Apparently not."

"Blaise is seeing Luna Lovegood."

She laughed as Draco blinked, his face going blank.

"Startling, isn't it?"

"To say the least," said Draco. He frowned, obviously trying to picture the two of them together. His face didn't twist when he finally put the two together though. Pansy had been surprised to find that the couple might actually be compatible as well.

Someone came in the room. Pansy heard the steps and Draco looked over her shoulder. She turned to see Ginny in the doorway.

"Sorry," said the Gryffindor. "Were you two catching up?"

"Not much to catch up on," said Pansy, giving Draco a parting smile and standing. "I'm going to go unpack. I hate it when my clothes get wrinkled."

She left the room and closed the door mostly shut behind her. She walked down the hallway, slipped off her heels, and walked back. She peered through the crack that she had left.

"Feeling better?" Ginny was asking, perched on the chair she had just vacated.

"Yeah," said Draco. He picked his quill back up and Pansy mentally sighed. Sometimes the boy was a little too distant.

Ginny, she was pleased to note, didn't get offended or hurt. She just sat in the chair and crossed her arms. Draco put down the quill.

"I'm sorry about earlier," he said. "Pansy didn't know."

Pansy could see Ginny's face, but she did see the shrug and laugh.

"It's not like you made-out with her or anything, so don't apologize."

"Oh," said Draco, obviously taken off guard.

"She seems nice," Ginny continued. "A little forward, but nice."

Pansy grinned and Draco snorted.

"A little forward isn't quite the word I would use," he said, defending Pansy's lack of honor.

There were footsteps in the hall and Pansy turned around to see Hermione Granger standing in front of her with her hands on her hips.

"What do you think-," the girl started, but Pansy clamped a hand over her mouth.

"Shh," she commanded. "I'm eavesdropping."

Hermione batted her hand away. "What?" she asked quietly.

"Eavesdropping, as in listening to a conversation between Draco and Ginny."

"Why?"

"Because I want to see them together," said Pansy. "I think they're kind of cute with each other, don't you?"

"I haven't really seen them hang out," said Hermione, shrugging.

Pansy sighed. "Well, why do you think I'm standing here?" She scooted over and pulled Hermione over to the door.

"I'm not going to spy on one of my best friends," Hermione hissed, but then her curiosity got better of her and she peered through as well.

"I've never been good at runes," Ginny was saying. She was now next to Draco, peering over at the parchment.

"I never really tried them before sixth year," said Draco, "but that summer I was in France and took a few courses then."

"Because obviously you cannot be entertained by a holiday," said Ginny.

"I can be entertained by holiday," Draco objected.

"And this proves the contrary," said Ginny, gesturing to the table.

"It's different."

"Is it really?"

Ginny was smiling, her eyes sparkling as she baited Draco. Pansy thought it was adorable.

"Yes, it is," said Draco. "This is because of the war."

"There was a war when you were in your sixth year as well."

Draco rolled his eyes; Ginny grinned and flicked at his hair.

"Well I'm off to help Fred and George," she said, straightening to leave.

"Why are you always rushing off?" asked Draco, turning the teasing on her.

"When was I rushing off?"

"This morning for one," said Draco.

Ginny's cheeks went scarlet. Pansy would have given her favorite gold necklace to know what had happened that morning.

"Did you want me to stay longer?" she asked.

"I'm just saying you didn't have to rush off," said Draco, and then he stepped closer to her, his right hand brushing across her cheek. He was looking at her the way he had never looked at Pansy, as if he was seeing Ginny for the first time and recalling her from memory all at once. She tilted her head up, he leaned down, and then his left hand neatly grasped his wand from the desk and he pointed it at the door. It slammed shut.

Pansy laughed. "Took you long enough Draco!" she called through the wood and then she walked down the hall, Hermione following her. "I'm heading upstairs to unpack," she told the Gryffindor. "Did you need me for something?"?"

"Um, yeah, actually," said Hermione, blushing slightly.

Pansy arched her eyebrow. She had learned the move from Draco and it had taken her a few months to perfect the expression.

"Well, there's no subtle way to say it, so I'm just going to tell you straight out. Mrs. Weasley thinks that you are dressed a little too scantily for present company and wanted me to hint to you that maybe you should put some more clothes on."

Hermione blushed redder. Pansy looked down at her outfit.

"What exactly didn't she like about it?"

"Well, the lack of it, I guess," said Hermione, still red.

Pansy laughed. "Fair enough. I'll go see what I can change into."

She walked up two flights of stairs to her room. Dumbledore had sent her trunks over and she began to unpack, mulling over clothing options as she did. When she had gone through all of her trunks, she walked down a set of stairs to Hermione's room. The door was open so she walked in to find the girl reading. Of course she was reading, and something thick and boring by the look of it.

"Hey, Granger?" she asked.

"Yes?" asked Hermione.

"I'm having a problem with the whole modest dressing thing. You have anything I can borrow?"

Hermione raised her eyebrows. "Are you serious?"

"Yeah," said Pansy. "I don't exactly dress family friendly, and normally I wouldn't care, but I am living with Gryffindors for the time being so I figure I should play nice."

"I mean," said Hermione, trying to explain something, "it's just that…all I really have are jeans and such. Muggle clothes."

Pansy shrugged. "Half of wizarding fashion comes from the Muggle runways."

"Really?"

"It's how I knew your kind couldn't be half as bad as everyone was saying," said Pansy smiling. "I mean what is so bad about Chenille? Or Gucci? Where would we be without those cute little Gucci knock offs in the wizarding stores? Or the Armani-style dress robe suits?"

Hermione stared at her. "Well, I don't have any Armani," she said, opening her wardrobe. "Just generic jeans and jumpers."

Pansy walked over and cast a critical eye over the trousers before pulling a darker pair out. She wriggled out of her skirt to put them on and Hermione quickly looked away.

"I've got knickers on," Pansy laughed. Well, if you could call the black lace that.

"You left the door open," said Hermione, walking over to shut it before anyone walked by. Pansy shrugged. She had great legs.

She pulled the jeans up and fastened the button and zipper. She stared at herself critically in the mirror. She had never worn jeans before and she hated how they covered her entire leg, even though the straight cut did add to their length. She turned and was surprised to see that her butt didn't look half-bad in them, thought there was a good inch of fabric she could pull away from her thighs. She gave Hermione a smile.

"Mind if I borrow them?" she asked.

"Not at all," the Gryffindor said. "Do you want a top as well?"

Pansy shook her head. "I think this is as modest as I can go. Anymore and I'll feel like the Witches Coven in Scotland."

"The who?"

"The witches who dress in sacks and swear off men so they can purify their inner magic," said Pansy. She made a face. "Please, taint my magic any day, is what I'm saying. I'll go find one of my own. Thanks though."

"Yeah," said Hermione as she left. "Not problem."

It was in walking up the stairs that Pansy realized how comfortable the jeans were.

Please leave a review!





14. The Secret of the Chamber Revealed

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, nor did I get him for Christmas (sigh).

Author's Note: So, because I am ridiculously late on this update, I've a bunch of…disgruntled reviewers. I apologize. There was a whole bunch of stuff all at once, combined with writer's block, but I finally have the next chapter done! I won't be replying to individual reviews at this time because I'm a little afraid to read them all and their demands for an update (lol!). I will be trying to update a bit quicker this week, because I am on vacation, but the next chapter is proving a little difficult to get into. So, please accept my apologies, and enjoy the next chapter!

Draco shut the door with a simple flick of his wand and then hesitated. He had used Pansy and Hermione's presence as an excuse to step close to Ginny, to brush his hand down her cheek, but all of a sudden, he didn't know if he should keep going. Was this moving too fast? Was it completely unwarranted? How did one behave in an actual relationship?

Ginny answered his questions by stepping up on her tiptoes, her hand reaching behind his neck to press their lips together. He felt her soft lips on his own, relishing in the feeling before parting his lips, delving deeper. She wasn't a passive kisser like the girls he had 'dated' before; she responded. There was no dominant partner in the kiss, something Draco had never experience before. It was novel, almost as if he was kissing for the first time and he didn't want to stop.

He did though, because Ginny had been right, he wouldn't let himself get lost when he might take Ginny with him. He pulled back and her eyes blinked open, locking onto his own.

"You kiss with your eyes open," she said, still holding onto his neck, keeping them close.

He paused, trying to search her gaze. "Is that bad?" he asked.

She smiled and shook her head. "No, just a little funny. It seems very symbolic of your attitude."

"How so?"

"You're scared of not being able to see what you are getting into, aren't you?"

"Since when did you become a psychologist?"

"I think it's a necessity for dating you."

Her eyes were laughing when she said that, which meant she wasn't really bothered, but he wondered if maybe it was just too much work, if he was too much work.

"I don't-," he started, but she shook her head.

"Don't apologize."

He nodded; she grinned and tapped his nose.

"You're cute when you're thinking."

He knew his face screwed up at her tap because she laughed. She was always laughing or smiling or grinning and, strangely, it wasn't aggravating.

She stepped back and looked at the papers on his desk.

"What are you doing now?" she asked.

"Refining my equation," said Draco. "The Fortescue vault hadn't been broken into for some time, which means they never had the goblet."

"Because it was never stolen," said Ginny.

"Exactly." Draco nodded. "Because I can cut them completely out of the goblet's path, I can also take out a few families around them and so forth."

"But you don't think a family still has the horcrux, just that by finding the last owner you can find the last thief."

"And when we find the last thief, we can find out where the goblet was stashed."

"And you're putting all of this information into mathematical equations."

"Yes."

Ginny raised her eyebrows. "Who knew that math could solve crimes? It's almost cool."

Draco frowned. "What was wrong with math before?"

"You like math, don't you? You were one of those kids in basic arithmetic tutoring sessions before Hogwarts who read ahead and took the optional algebra courses and what not."

"Yeah," said Draco, "but I studied the optional math on my own, some trig, some geometry, the calculus was a lot of fun." He shrugged because to him it wasn't that big of a deal. He could never understand why other people found learning boring.

Ginny stared then shook her head. "Oh Merlin, my boyfriend's a nerd," she groaned.

"Hey," said Draco, slightly insulted.

"A nerd," said Ginny, walking to the door. She sighed as she left. Draco followed her, but she quickened her pace her pace in the hall, turning around to sing out 'Nerd!' as she left.

"I object to that term!" Draco called, but his lips twitched once she left. He schooled his expression before returning to his work. He wanted to get this done before the Order meeting.

The Order meeting started out normally enough, until Pansy showed up that is. The members slowly trickled into the dining room where there was coffee, tea, butterbeer and a few scones and other tidbits. Draco knew the food was there in an attempt to keep the mood light, but there was always a feeling of unease even with the snacks. Draco had been accepted, yes, but suddenly certain topics (such as Lucius Malfoy) were stilted as the adults tried to phrase 'Malfoy is a sick bastard and needs to be taken out before he can kill any more innocent people' as delicately as possible.

Draco had managed to suppress the flinch whenever his father was mentioned because the entire table would glance his way when they mentioned his father. Well, his way and in Ginny's direction, oddly enough. There was more to those looks than just 'she's dating the son of Lucius Malfoy' but he couldn't quite grasp what.

Adding Pansy to this mix was a recipe for disaster. She flounced down the stairs, fashionably late, wearing a pair of blue jeans and a gold, sparkling top that only had one sleeve. The back of the shirt consisted of a few strings tied together to keep it from falling off.

"Do you like?" she asked Draco, twirling in the front of the table so that everyone could see. "I thought wearing the colors might help the integration process. Go team!" And then she pumped her arm into the air and flashed a smile.

"For the sake of Salazar," a smooth, disgusted voice interrupted, "do not ever wear that color again."

Pansy whipped around to see her Potions Professor glaring at the outfit. She gave a shriek, clamped a hand over her mouth, and stared. Once she regained her senses, and figured out the truth, she shrieked again and jumped Professor Snape, hands flying around his neck and squeezing hard.

"Miss Parkinson," said Snape, "I am your Head of House, not a potential suitor. Please remember this; there is a roomful of young men on whom you can lather with your attentions."

"But Draco's already taken and everyone else is a Gryffindor." Pansy pouted, stepping back and flicking her hair over her shoulder.

"Perhaps you should follow his example and find a Weasley," said Snape dryly. "Is Albus here yet? I had a matter I wished to discuss with him."

And then the Order began to settle down enough to get to the business at hand, namely welcoming their new member and trying to figure out how to defeat the Dark Lord.

When Pansy was asked how she had known it was Nott who called the raid on the Fortescue home, she, thankfully, did not regal the table with exactly how she had come across the information. She did make several innuendos, paused during the middle of her sentences to give a slow smile, and licked her lips while staring at Ron Weasley, who turned scarlet and couldn't look her in the eye for the rest of the evening.

Mrs. Weasley frowned and gave pointed looks to Mr. Weasley who pretended not to see them. Moody growled, Sirius looked a little uncomfortable, Kingsley hid a smile, and McGonagall frowned severely. Potter had never been redder; Hermione looked tentatively objecting. Dumbledore only got annoyed when, for the fifth time, their plans were halted because Moody made a derogatory comment about the Slytherins (We can't trust them; they'll stab us in the back) and Pansy rejoined with an innuendo and a wink (But only in the morning after).

Moody: Does anyone remember what Salazar was known for?

Pansy (looking up from her nails, innocently): A great night in bed?

Moody: Albus, this is insane. They're Death Eaters and not to be trusted. They'll turn our plans over to the Dark Lord quicker than –

Pansy (raising an eyebrow): A man comes in a roomful of Veela?

Ginny coughed down a bout of laughter; Fred and George stared at her with unabashed awe.

The meeting finally came to a close and Draco got to his feet as quickly as possible without appearing to be retreating. He paused when Moody approached Dumbledore with a fire in his eye. His magical one was switching back and forth between Pansy, Draco, and Severus.

"Albus," he growled, "what's happening? We're supposed to fighting Voldemort, not hosting his followers. They're Slytherin, the lot of them, and we all know that we can't trust them. They're just looking after themselves and with the right price, they'll sell us out without batting an eye."

Dumbledore didn't respond right away. He frowned at the ex-Auror and then turned to the rest of the table. The members were all standing, but hanging back, wondering what Dumbledore was going to say.

"Is there anyone else who feels this way?" the Headmaster asked.

A few people glanced at each other, before looking to the floor. Sirius shifted uncomfortably before clearing his throat.

"I, uh, might not like…some members here," he said.

"Please don't play coy now, Black," Snape interrupted acidly. "It's never stopped you before."

Sirius shot the Potions Master a look. "Fine," he said. "I've never been fond of Snivellus here, in fact, I think his presence is a little more than trying, but I've never doubted your judgment, Albus. If you trust him, than I can believe that you must see something that only you can in him, like a mother with an ugly baby."

"Touched, Black," the Potions Master sniped.

"Shut up," said Black.

Everyone looked to Dumbledore who nodded.

"Thank you," he said to Sirius. "Does anyone else feel a sense of unease with the members?"

Again, a baited silence. Ginny raised her hand.

"Umm, I guess a little bit," she said. "I mean, my boyfriend's ex is here and wearing an extremely hot top right now."

Pansy turned and blew Ginny a kiss. "I'll let you borrow it sometime," she said. "It'll go perfectly with your hair, and it's got adjustable straps, so it's bound to fit."

Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat, raising her eyebrows at Ginny, meaning clear.

"You can totally put a shirt under it," said Pansy quickly. "So it's a little less risqué."

There was a muted laughter and the mood immediately lifted.

"In answer to your concerns, Alastor," said Dumbledore, "I would ask that you give these fine people a chance to prove themselves. I vouch for every one of them."

Moody was not appeased. "Albus, this is asking for trouble." He turned to appeal to the rest of the members. "What reason do you have to trust them? Have you forgotten who they are? Here's a Slytherin whore working for the Dark Lord and you trust her?"

"Alastor!" exclaimed Minerva.

"I prefer 'Scarlet Witch'," said Pansy, pulling up a magical mirror to check her complexion.

"And we've a Death Eater right here in our midst," said Moody, jerking his hand at Snape.

"He's a spy, Alastor," said Lupin, trying to appease him.

Draco slipped his unconcerned mask up as Moody turned to him, eye lit with indignation.

"And to top it all, the son of Lucius Malfoy, Voldemort's right hand man. Do you really think he believes in equality? Do you really believe he's here to help and not to spy?"

"He's been disowned," said Sirius. "That says a lot."

"It's a lie, a ruse," said Moody. "He knows exactly how to tug at your heartstrings. He's a Malfoy. They don't just turn around to associate with Half-bloods and Muggle-borns."

"Draco's saved most of our lives," said Bill. "You can't honestly think that he's in league with Voldemort."

"Unbelievable," said Moody. "So he's fooled you too then. What about you, Arthur? Don't tell me you've forgiven the son of Lucius Malfoy."

Draco frowned. There was something in that question that he didn't understand, but it was apparent that Mr. Weasley did because he swallowed, but shook his head.

"I have nothing to forgive."

Moody stepped back, obviously appalled. "Nothing to forgive?" he exclaimed. "Have you forgotten what Malfoy did to your daughter? Do you not care?"

What Malfoy had done? Draco had no clue what his father had done, but it must have been bad because Mrs. Weasley stepped forward, cheeks flushed.

"How dare you?" she exclaimed.

"How dare I?" Moody responded. "How dare you house his son? How dare you let him even look at her after what happened?"

"Afterwhat happened?" Draco asked, but the ex-Auror was continuing, his voice growing louder.

"In your naïve attempts to reach out to the world, you are throwing your daughter in with the wolves, Molly!"

"I am doing what I think is best."

"You are feeding into a delusion and not seeing the danger! Are you that blind-sided?"

"Moody, you will not speak to my wife in that manner!" said Arthur tightly.

"Yeah, that's our mum," Fred and George chorused.

"And she is your sister," Moody snapped to the boys. He turned to Arthur. "Get your daughter away before it's too late."

"Alastor," said Arthur, "you go too far."

"I am the only one going far enough; I am the only that is looking out for your daughter's safety!"

"That is not true," said Arthur even as the rest of the Weasley family denied the ex-Auror's statements, speaking over each other in outrage. Draco could hardly pick out the individual voices raised in protest, and he still had no clue to what they were referring to, but a small voice in the back of his mind told him he didn't want to know.

"I do not speak out of turn!" Moody thundered at Bill. "Your family does not seem to remember what happened. How can you forget something like that?"

"I can make my own decisions. It is my choice," Ginny told the Auror, trying to hold Fred and George back who were still yelling and reaching for their wands. He didn't hear her because he was shouting between Bill and Mrs. Weasley.

"What would you have me think? You are caring for his only son, the boy who is just like him, you cannot deny that!"

"He's not his father," Bill protested.

"How dare you imply that I do not care for my daughter? I love Ginny with all of my heart, just as much as her brothers and I do not wish to see her hurt or harmed in anyway, but you are completely unfounded in all of your accusations, Alastor!" Mrs. Weasley raged. "You can leave this house at this instant!"

"You really have forgotten what happened, haven't you? How could you?" asked Moody.

And then, in the slight lull that followed, Draco heard his own voice.

"What happened?"

His voice was low and cold, just like Lucius', but at that moment, he didn't care. Every head turned to him, reluctance in their eyes. Bill looked at him with sympathy and a little bit of regret.

"What happened?" he asked again, looking to Ginny, but she wouldn't meet his gaze. She was staring at the table.

There was silence again, but Moody broke it by laughing. "He doesn't even know?" he asked in complete disbelief.

"Alastor, please," said Dumbledore, but the ex-Auror was already talking, revealing the story to Draco in a voice that resembled glee.

"Your son of bitch father dropped the diary of Thomas Riddle into little Ginny's schoolbooks when she was a first year. The diary was a Horcrux. Voldemort possessed her, and if it hadn't been for Potter defeating a Basilisk and the ghost of Riddle, she would have died."

Draco stared at him in shock, stared at the weathered face with the scarred skin and the crazed hair. Moody's face was twisted into a half-grin at his expression, the magical eye boring right through him. He took an involuntary step backward.

"No," he said, turning to Ginny who still wasn't looking at him.

"Oh yes," said Moody. "And you really didn't know, did you? They really have forgotten."

"Alastor," said Dumbledore, his voice more displeased than Draco ever remembered hearing, "leave. Now."

Draco ignored the ex-Auror's exit of curses and grim predictions of the future and looked to Bill, wanting Bill to say it wasn't true, that Moody had just made it up to anger him, but Bill's face said it all.

"It's true," said Draco.

"It is," Bill agreed quietly.

Draco shook his head, letting out a half-laugh of disbelief and betrayal.

"You knew," he said. "You knew that and you didn't tell me?" He was angry and his frigid, hard voice, the one that sounded exactly like Lucius, showed it all too well. Draco stared at the entire room, realizing that they had all known what his father had done, and they had told him nothing. Betrayal hit hard; he whirled around so he wouldn't have to see the pitying faces, his hands plowing through his hair as he tried to incorporate this new information.

"Draco," said Bill.

"Don't," said Draco, voice strained.

"Draco, please," said Bill, and Draco sensed motion as the eldest Weasley sibling stepped closer. He whipped around in rage.

"Va te faire foutre!" he yelled at the former professor.

Bill winced, holding up his hands as Draco continued.

"You knew, vous avez su, and you didn't tell me? Were you ever going to tell me, etiez-vous?"

He was slipping between French and English, too shocked, too angry, too confused to think straight, but Bill understood. Draco was belatedly thankful that the curse came out in French. He shook his head, looking over to Ginny.

"You didn't tell me," he accused.

She raised her head, shaking her hair back from her face and meeting his gaze defiantly.

"I didn't," she agreed, daring him to object.

"Why not?" he demanded. "Did you somehow think this wasn't important?"

"It was too important," she responded.

Draco stared, trying to work his way around her twisted logic. "Too important?" he asked. He shook his head again and took a step backwards. He suddenly needed space.

"Draco," she said, stepping forward. Her voice was trembling; she was trembling. "Please wait."

She already knew he was going, even before he had decided it in his mind.

He stepped back again, trying not to see the way her eyes were blinking, the hand that she reached out. He reached into his pocket and grasped his wand. He was gone with a crack.

The first thing he did when he appeared in his flat was to pull up ward after ward, making sure that no one could come in and then he stumbled into the kitchen and spent ten minutes leaning over the sink, afraid he was going to be sick.

How could they not tell him? How could Bill not mention that his father had given Ginny the diary of Thomas Riddle? How could Ginny never even bring it up?

He wasn't expecting her to just mention it in passing, but didn't he deserve to know?

He walked back to his living room and collapsed on the sofa, clenching his jaw and curling his hands into fists. How could Ginny date him? How could her parents even let her? His father, his own sodding father, had gotten her possessed by Thomas Bloody Riddle.

Draco jumped to his feet, striding to the door. He was going to kill Lucius.

He stopped halfway and spun around. What was he thinking? Kill Lucius? It wasn't even possible. The Dark Lord couldn't kill his father.

But did he even want to kill his father? So he had given Ginny the diary, he probably had no idea what it was, or that it was a Horcrux. It was all a misunderstanding.

Yeah, right. Who was he fooling? Lucius Malfoy would have known what that diary was. He had been trying to kill Harry Potter with it. He probably hadn't known it was a Horcrux, but he would know enough to understand the mechanics. Someone would read it and be possessed and open the Chamber of Secrets. His father had no doubt hoped Harry Potter would be killed as a result. Ginny was just an instrument to get it done, just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

His mind rebelled at that thought. Ginny was not an instrument; she was beautiful, smart, fearless…

Oh Merlin, that was the reason she was fearless, that was why nothing scared her. She had been possessed by the Dark Lord, what could be worse? Possessions and exorcisms were never complete, a little bit of residue always remained on the victim. A little bit of his soul had rubbed off on hers. That was the reason she could never be happy with Harry Potter; that was the reason he found her so perfect.

How twisted did that make him? The only reason he liked Ginny was because she had that little bit of darkness. The only reason she was with him was because he was tainted as well.

He was going to be sick again.

He strode back over to the sink, staring at the silver bottom, the truth reassuring him, letting him breathe again.

No, he didn't like Ginny because she had a little bit of the Dark Lord's soul. He had never admired her for her darkness, but the way she had overcome it, the way she had survived. She hadn't locked the darkness away, put it in some box only to be brought out in the middle of the night in the shape of a horrifying dream. She had examined that bit of tainted soul, examined it, learned it, and then incorporated it as a part of her. By accepting that bit of black, she had taken away its power, she had taken away its control and fear. That was why he admired her.

Maybe she saw a little bit of the same in him, except he was mostly dark. There was a real evil in him, one that could control him if he would let it. Like right now, it was screaming for him to kill his father.

Yes, he was going to kill his father. He walked to the door, hand gripping his wand before he stopped himself again. He couldn't just kill his father. Two years ago he would have killed Ginny if it had been necessary. Two years ago he would have done everything in his power to raise the Dark Lord.

But that was two years ago. He had changed.

"Merde!" he half-yelled at the wall.

If he was going to kill Lucius; he needed a plan.

He walked back into the kitchen, grabbing a glass from the cupboard over the sink and jerking the faucet handle on. He ran his fingers under the water, already sifting through plans. He couldn't face his father in a duel, nor would he want to. That was too public, too plebian.

Poison was always an option though.

He flipped through the pages of lethal poisons in his head, filling the glass when the water was cold enough. For a brief second he though of drinking something stronger, but he shook his head and turned the tap off. He needed a clear head right now.

He wandered into the small dining room, sipping at his water.

It took thirty seconds before he came to the only conclusion. He could never kill his father, he simply couldn't. There was some sort of bond between them that tied his hands, protecting his father. The only affection he had known as a child, after Lukas had been killed, was from Lucius. How could he end that? He tried to argue, tried to object, but he was never one to ignore the truth, not even when it didn't suit him. Lucius Malfoy would not die by his hands.

"Damn it!" he screamed, smashing the glass onto the table.

The cup shattered under his hand and he sank into the chair, watching the water splash over the table's edge while blood pooled among the shards of glass. His eyes stung and he blinked, pushing the feeling away. There would be no use crying, not even if he could. There were other things to be done. Just because he couldn't kill Lucius didn't mean he was going to let the incident go.

Ginny was his girlfriend. Sweet, beautiful, funny, fearless Ginny, and even though his father had inadvertently been the reason he found her intriguing and the reason she would even consider dating him, she could have died, or worse. No, he couldn't just sit back.

He picked the few glass shards from his hands and cleaned up the mess with a wave of his wand. He then strode straight into his study. He had a lot of work to do.

"Still no word?" asked Bill, coming down the stairs, rather early in the morning for him but, as usual, Sirius was already at the table drinking coffee.

It had been a day and a half since Draco had Apparated from the Order Headquarters. Bill knew that sometimes Draco just needed time, but he had wanted some form of contact. All yesterday he had waited for word and now it was going on the second. He was starting to get worried.

Sirius looked up from the table and shook his head. "Kingsley is keeping an eye out at the Ministry, but nothing so far. Dumbledore finally got into his apartment half an hour ago."

"And?"

"Not there."

Bill sighed, rubbing his eyes. "Damn it," he muttered.

"What did you expect?" asked Sirius. "Kid's a genius, isn't he?"

"You'd think for a genius he'd be smarter," said Bill, crossing to the table and pouring himself from coffee.

Sirius gave a half-laugh and then the fireplace flared. Kingsley stepped out of the Floo.

"I know what our boy's been up to," he announced, and dropped a newspaper onto the table.

Bill leaned over with trepidation and stared at the picture on the front of the paper. Draco was shaking hands with a man while several people cheered. It looked like he was at a board meeting. The headline proclaimed 'Disinherited Malfoy Reveals a Dazzling Intellect' while the caption under the picture read 'The lately disinherited Draco Malfoy has come forward as the unnamed sponsor of the new potions company, Gere Inc.'

"Gere Incorporated," said Bill. "That's the company that has a new brand of medical potions out, right?"

"And the company that has been working on a cure for Lycanthropy," said Sirius. "They've been able to inject a patient with some condensed form of the Wolfsbane right after the man was bit by a werewolf. Since then, he hasn't transformed."

"Seriously?" asked Bill.

"The company is attributing Draco with the means of the discovery," said Kingsley. "They say his investment kept them in business and now they are the fastest growing company this year. They say he made a cool fifteen million off of the investment."

"Disgusting," said Sirius, shaking his head at the fact that a teenager had that sort of cash.

"He's given most of that away to various charities and museums," the Auror continued.

"He what?" asked Bill.

"Why?" asked Sirius.

"And," said Kingsley, "he's taking credit for the translation of the last chapter in the Averne, although he did cite you as the main translator of the Persian Runes."

Bill shook his head. "I hardly did anything, but why would he even…I thought he wanted to hide his intlligence."

"Turn to page four," said Kingsley.

Bill flipped to the fourth page of the newspaper, scanning the article and frowning.

"A company collapsed," he said. "Why is this-?" but then he stopped because he answered his own question. The company that had collapsed, Wren and Sons, had been funded heavily by Malfoy Enterprises.

"All it took was a few words," said Kingsley. "The kid knew exactly what to say."

"Draco did that?" asked Bill. "How do you know?"

"I re-traced his steps," said Kingsley. "Gere is the rival of Wren and Sons. Draco revealed himself to be the major supporter, and also revealed that he's incredibly smart when he put his name on the translation of the Averne. Other investors saw that and decided to buy shares in the company. After he met with the directors of Gere, he went out to lunch with a few prominent businessmen, men that had been invested in Wren and Son. After that lunch, most of them pulled out. Then, the Aurors got a tip that there was an attack at the Wren and Sons office and they arrived just as a news conference was called by an anonymous caller and so all of the reporters were treated to the sight of Aurors running into the building. Then, to top everything off, the Committee of Internal Affairs got wind of an embezzlement scam and started looking into Carson Wren himself. He was arrested on fraud and embezzlement charges. The company went under in a matter of six hours."

"Why that company?" asked Sirius.

"Lucius Malfoy was a heavy investor. He was one of the co-founders before he pulled out and just remained the financial backbone and now he's lost a major revenue source. The Committee is investigating all of Malfoy's finances and business transactions as well so he's losing even more money. Not enough to ruin him but a good fifty million is gone and it's only going to get worse as the investigation drags on."

"Incredible," said Sirius, shaking his head. "Lucius must be pitching a fit."

"So why isn't Draco back then?" asked Bill.

"I don't think he's done," said Kingsley. "I don't know what else he can do, but just fifty million? If he's anything like his father-,"

"He's not," Bill interrupted.

Sirius snorted. "He's not a murderer, yeah, but can you honestly say that he didn't get anything from his father? Just because he's with us doesn't mean he isn't a Malfoy."

Bill knew Sirius was right, even though he hated to admit it. He liked to think that Draco was cold and hard because he had a cold and hard childhood, but the truth was he had inherited a lot from Lucius Malfoy.

"If he's anything like his father, than what?" he asked Kingsley.

The Auror shrugged. "I think he wants to meet him."

"Who?"

"Lucius," said Kingsley. "What good is revenge if the perpetrator never knows what they did wrong?"

Bill groaned, having a sinking feeling that the Auror was right. "Damn it," he muttered.

Bill stayed in the Headquarters for most of the day, even though the family was going out shopping for Christmas presents. He wanted to be there if, by any small chance, Draco came back. Sirius hung back with him, never one to enjoy shopping.

Later that evening, Bill's patience paid off. The Floo ignited and Draco stepped out, carrying a few packages and nodding to Bill as if nothing had happened.

"Hey," he said, and started for the stairs.

"Whoa," said Bill. "Hold up. You disappear for two days and all you can say is 'hey'? Where the hell have you been?"

Draco turned and shrugged. "Around. I had some business that called my attention."

"By business you mean this?" asked Bill, holding up the paper. But he didn't hold up the front page, no, he held up page four which detailed the collapse of Wren & Sons.

Draco stepped closer to look at the article and frowned.

"No," he said. "That's not one of the companies I'm invested in." He shrugged again and began to walk off, but Bill knew he was lying. There had been a slight flicker of surprise in his eyes.

"Draco, don't lie to me," he called after the boy.

Bill watched Draco pause, still looking towards the stairs. The white-blond head tilted down and Draco sighed before turning to face him again.

"So what?" he asked.

And Bill paused, suddenly not knowing what to say. Did he even disagree with Draco's actions?

"Just…don't do anything you'll regret later," he said.

Draco's eyebrow rose in surprise but he nodded and then turned once more to the stairs. Bill didn't call him back this time but slumped at the dining room table.

His family chose that moment to come home, laughing and smiling as they tried hiding parcels from each other. His mother immediately noticed his expression.

"Bill, what's wrong?" she asked, putting her bags down. "Are you…is it Draco?"

Ginny looked over. "What about Draco? Is he alright?"

"I think so," said Bill. "He came back just a minute ago but he said he had somewhere else to go."

"Where?" asked Ginny.

"He didn't say," said Bill. "Just said it was business. He should be down in a few minutes."

Ginny looked at the stairs for a minute before setting her packages to the side and sitting with Bill at the table.

"I'll put some tea on," said Mrs. Weasley. "We all do with a hot cup of tea after shopping all day."

And the rest of the family gathered around the table, regaling Bill with their shopping horrors and whispering presents in each other's ears. It took half an hour until Draco came down, and then everyone stopped talking and looked to the stairs at the first sound of footsteps.

The minute Draco came into sight, Bill knew there was trouble. Draco was wearing an obviously expensive suit in the latest style, a blend of wizard and Muggle fashion. His trousers were a deep black and his button up shirt was silver and pure silk. The top two buttons were undone, not because he was trying for casual, but because he was making a statement. He was wearing a vest, black with the thinnest of silver pinstripes that matched the shirt. His black jacket over that was longer, following the more traditional wizard fashions of dress robes, but it was fitted to him and not free-flowing. The jacket was embroidered with silver stitching around the cuffs and collar and the buttons were silver as well.

A charcoal overcoat was draped over his arm and his shoes were new black leather boots. His hair was tussled, falling into his eyes and Bill glimpsed a silver chain around his neck that accompanied the ivory charm he had given him last year. He had a ring on his right index finger.

"Going somewhere special?" Bill asked once he came down.

Draco looked up from his wrist where he was fiddling with the cuff of his sleeve.

"Pardon?" he asked, raising an eyebrow, his face a mask of polite indifference.

Bill gestured to the get-up, knowing that Draco must be wearing a fortune in new clothes but the kid seemed absolutely at ease in the outfit. He then wondered how much Draco's wardrobe had cost throughout the years.

"You're dressed up," said Bill.

"Yes," said Draco. "I told you I had to go out."

"Where are you going?" Bill asked.

"I have business to attend," said Draco.

"Business," said Bill.

Draco frowned, obviously annoyed. "Yes, business. Are you content with that or are you going to continue with the inquisition?"

Bill raised his eyebrows and watched Draco let out a silent breath. Usually Draco apologized, or made an attempt at an apology, after his cold brush-offs, but Draco simply shook his head.

"I'll be back later tonight."

And then Draco pulled out his wand and Apparated.

Bill sighed and sipped at his tea.

So, next chapter is a major Lucius chapter (which is why it's proving a little difficult to write), but please leave a review because I find them encouraging, and I promise to update at lease by Tuesday, if not sooner.





15. Stalemate

Disclaimer: I am not JK so I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would miss every deadline and I'm pretty sure people would camp out at my doorstep until I freaking up dated already. Sorry. The explanation is at the end of this chapter.

Draco Apparated out of the Order headquarters and appeared on a well-lit street of cobblestone. The street was wide and clean and several well-dressed couples were wandering together, hands clasped, some tipsy already, going to the various clubs or restaurants on the rich end of Diagon Alley.

The club he was attending didn't deserve the name. It was a restaurant, a hotel, a business convention, a casino and a lounge all rolled into one and it was frequented by the wizarding world's elite. Draco knew they were already trying to figure out ways to give Harry Potter a membership without allying themselves with the boy-hero. The Triad did not wish to alienate some of their more affluent clientele.

Draco looked up at the large marble building, taking a deep breath of the cold winter air. The main entrance was lit, the warm yellow light falling among the massive pillars to sweep across the grand marble stairs leading up from the road. Draco had been here before, but this was the first time he was arriving by himself, without the protection of the name 'Malfoy'. He recalled the gargoyles that guarded the entrance with perfect clarity, but they seemed much more sinister now.

One did not need a membership to enter the restaurant and lounge, or even an invite. It was necessary to be registered to stay in the hotel in the floors above, and the members received additional benefits, but the main areas were open to anyone with the proper dress.

Draco steeled himself and then ran lightly up the steps. The quicker he was inside the building, the less time he would have to dread the meeting. He arrived at the large doors which were swept open for him by uniformed doormen but didn't spare them a glance.

The foyer was large and bright. The oriental carpeting was plush and in shades of blue, green, and gold. Dazzling crystal chandeliers hung from a gilded ceiling. Large landscape paintings hung on gold and ivory wallpaper. There were sofas and chaises arranged around the several fireplaces and an open bar stood on one side to entertain guests who were waiting for large parties. Uniformed attendants saw to every guest. There was no need for check-in counters or registers; the Triad was able to bill private accounts directly.

A tall man in his thirties approached Draco, his blue and white uniform pressed perfectly.

"How are you today, Mr. Draco Malfoy?" he asked, using the correct form of his name. As he was disowned, he must be distinguished apart from the Malfoy family. Had he still been part of his family, he would have been titled 'Master Malfoy'.

"Quite well," said Draco.

"May I take your coat for you, sir?"

"Yes, thank you."

Draco let the man help him out of his coat and the attendant draped it gently over his arm.

"What are your plans for this evening, sir? If you are waiting for a party, I can offer you some refreshments, or I can direct you to the accommodations director if you need a room."

They would only offer him a room if they were interested in his membership. Draco smirked, knowing that his actions of the past two days would make him an irresistible candidate.

"Not this evening, but another time," Draco promised, accepting the offer. "I'm actually meeting an acquaintance in the restaurant."

"Very good, sir," said the attendant. "Have a nice evening."

Again, it was a sign of the club's desire to seek his patronage that he was not pressed for the name of his companions.

Draco tipped the man nicely and then allowed his cool mask to become that much more arrogant. It wouldn't do for anyone to see the deep breath he took as he started towards the grand doors in the back of the lobby.

The doors were again opened for him by the club's employees. The staircase leading down to the restaurant was rather short, but still extremely grand, carpeted in scarlet with gold banisters. At the floor was a long mahogany bar counter with matching with gold-overlay barstools. Draco knew than every drink invented was possible to be made behind that counter.

Several guests were sipping at cocktails and milling about. Others were standing at the banister across from the counter and watching the couples on the large dance floor, which was accessible by descending a few low steps which were also carpeted in scarlet. The dance floor was polished wood with a low stage on the far end boasting a talented house band and several lounge singers. The main dining area was a large balcony area, directly to the right of the main staircase. No expense was spared on these interior furnishings either, going as close as possible to overdone without losing elegance and class.

"Can I get you a table, sir?" the maître d' asked, approaching Draco.

"No, thank you," said Draco. "I am meeting someone actually."

"I do not think that any of our current guests are expecting you, sir."

"No," said Draco. "I do not think anyone is expecting my company, but nonetheless, if you could take me to the table of Lucius Malfoy, I would be most pleased."

The head waiter looked appropriately apprehensive. Surely Lucius Malfoy would not want to see the son he had disinherited, but at the same time, what if the split had not been hostile?

Draco watched the internal battle on the man's face before giving him a placating smile.

"It's quite alright," he said, leaning in confidentially, as if doing the man a favor. "I remember the way to our table quite well."

And then he sauntered away, approaching the stairs to the dining area as if he were merely meeting an old friend for dinner. Lucius' table was in the best lit area, not quite in the corner, but beside the low balcony rail so that the dance floor could be watched and so that those on the dance floor could see him. It was a table coveted by all politicians and businessmen, and to be invited to dine there was a true honor.

As soon as Draco ascended the stairs, his face became a cold mask of civility. He forced the thoughts of Ginny and the Dark Lord's diary from his mind. Even when in the most desperate of rages, it would not do to display such emotions here.

There were a few diners already seated, couples together and men in small business parties. Draco passed by them, not deigning to look over, his gaze focused on one man. He was still too far away for Lucius to notice him, and a part of his brain was screaming for him to turn back now. He didn't want to see his father. He never won when his father was involved; it would be prudent to turn back now.

But the elegant form of the blond man was drawing closer as his steps brought him towards the table. Lucius was wearing green today, meaning he wasn't in a temper, or upset, which was a surprise to Draco. He had just ruined one of his father's favorite companies. He had expecting deep blue robes, or a dark maroon. His father rarely wore black, a color which made the wearer look too menacing, or called to attention certain negative associations. Draco wore black tonight because he was playing high society and would like a little bit of threat in his demeanor. Still, the rich green robes were startling, almost upsetting. Green meant Lucius was feeling significantly bemused. Draco wondered if his father had again outplayed him, if, in fact, Lucius had been expecting him.

He drew close enough for his presence to be noticed by Lucius and his father looked up from his paper. Lucius raised his eyebrows, a sign of surprise. He hadn't been expected; the first point went to him and he smirked.

"Lucius," said Draco coolly. "Fancy seeing you here tonight. How was your day?"

It was a deliberate jab; Lucius didn't even blink. He leaned back in his chair, regarding Draco with grey eyes that measured him to some unseen scale. He was deemed 'uninteresting'.

Lucius waved a bejeweled hand, languidly, carelessly.

"I do not believe I requested any company tonight. Move along."

Draco resisted the urge to clench his teeth at being treated like nothing more than a common pestilence. He pulled out the chair across from his father and sat, leaning back, sprawled slightly because he was a teenager and could get away with cocky manners.

"Tell me, Lucius, how have you been since our last chat? How is your wife doing?"

With those last five words he lunged for Lucius' heart. Lucius hand clenched around the head of his cane, still a silver dragon, and suddenly Draco was no longer 'uninteresting'. He met his father's gaze with his own wicked, unrepentant, vengeful stare. Draco didn't break the gaze, not even when a waiter approached his father.

"I am sorry, Mr. Malfoy. Would you like this visitor to be removed from your table?"

Yes, no doubt this reunion was causing unease down in the management sector of the Triad. Lucius Malfoy was one of their most privileged members, but Draco had just stepped forward as a new social power. He vaguely wondered what they would do if they did escort him away from his father's table. Beg forgiveness? Offer him a host of complimentary services?

Lucius' lips stretched into a predatory smile.

"Benson," he said, without looking away from Draco. "Do you think that I am unable to remove any trying visitors myself?"

"No, sir. Of course not, sir. I apologize."

"Of course you do," said Lucius.

"It was not my intent to offend, sir."

"Of course it wasn't."

"Can I bring you anything, sir? A drink, perhaps, or a menu?"

"Scotch, my usual," said Lucius. He raised an eyebrow at Draco, the question clear.

"Nothing for me," said Draco.

He could see, in his peripheral, the waiter looking between them, confused and hesitant. Benson finally realized that the silence meant he was dismissed and hurried away.

Lucius' eyes slid to the side to watch the waiter's retreat and then he looked back to Draco, leaning back again.

"The wife is beautiful, as always," he said, returning to the pleasantries. "But your theatrics these past few days suggest that you did not come to exchange petty conversation."

The mocking edge to his tone meant he was less than impressed.

"I wouldn't wish to waste your time," said Draco, leaning back and looking over the empty table. His father hardly ever dined alone. "Were you expecting company?"

"Just your own," said Lucius.

Draco tried masking his surprise, but the edge of it must have slipped through his mask because Lucius' upper lip curled.

"You forget who raised you, Draco. You have always been a little more than transparent."

Lucius said it in a blasé manner, as if Draco really was no more than a passing amusement to him, and it stung, but he forced himself to take a breath before responding. It was in those few seconds that he noticed what he had overlooked before.

Lucius was too composed. His father should have been clearly annoyed and insulted by Draco's presence, for he was only the son who had been disowned. Lucius was too courteous; he should have been making a point of using flowery manners and overly elegant robes to prove his superiority. Lucius was on the offensive. Draco was confused; his father was putting too much effort in the attack.

Draco suddenly realized his confusion was exactly what Lucius wanted. Lucius did not know why Draco was seeking revenge; he didn't know what Draco wanted. He was trying to keep Draco off-balance, hoping for Draco to reveal something before the time was right.

Draco sat back in his chair, studying his father. He knew how to play this game, he had learned it young, but Lucius had far more experience, and the upper hand. Still, Draco had been living with a slew of Gryffindors for the past few weeks. He had learned the subtle art to blunt honesty and that was one thing Lucius could never understand, the one thing Lucius could not contend with.

Benson returned with the crystal tumbler of Scotch and set it in front of Lucius. The waiter obviously noticed the tension because he quickened his retreat.

Draco leaned forward, his expression set, deadly serious.

"Listen closely Lucius, for you will receive no further warnings. What I have done these past few days, I can and will do again if you force my hand. I will not stop at one business; I will not stop at an investigation. I will not stop until every single one of your businesses is bankrupt with the founders thrown out on the street."

Lucius raised an eyebrow. "Should I fear you, Draco? My influence is greater than your own; my empire stronger."

"And older," said Draco. "And tainted with your less than favorable associations. I have not forgotten who raised me; I will see your ruin complete if provoked. This is my oath."

"Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus," Lucius quoted with an ironic twist. "What has provoked you, Dragon?"

The childhood nickname. Another attempt at unsettling him; he had Lucius on edge.

"My second year at Hogwarts," he started. "The Chamber of Secrets was opened. Do you know by whom, Lucius?"

Lucius leaned back, shrugging a shoulder. "I am not interested in reviving the past. You threw that away, Draco."

Draco ignored the barb. "Let me revive a piece. You came into the possession of a diary, the diary of Thomas Marvolo Riddle. You placed that diary in the pile of schoolbooks belonging to a first year girl by name Ginevra Weasley. As a result, Miss Weasley was possessed by the spirit of Thomas Riddle, who is now known as the Lord Voldemort, and nearly killed.

"Reparations for the act have already begun and will approximate to seventy million galleons. Should Ginevra Weasley ever be harmed again, the consequences will be much greater."

"A Weasley," said Lucius. "Seventy million for the distress of a Weasley nearly six years ago. Why, in the name of Merlin, wo-,"

And Lucius stopped himself and his eyebrows rose. "Mon Dieu." Draco watched his father sit back in his chair. The grey eyes flickered with something, but he couldn't read it. Lucius' expression twisted, but was it with revulsion and distaste or was it merely an unconcerned amusement at the attraction of lesser beings?

Lucius took a sip of his Scotch, and then another. He set the glass back on the table and regarded Draco with cool eyes.

"A Weasley," he said, expression neutral. "Of all the women you could have dallied with, and you chose a Weasley."

Draco didn't say anything, but watched Lucius take another sip of the Scotch.

"Are you that pressed for company, Draco?" asked Lucius. "Is she the only one who would pleasure you now that you have forfeited your name? I understand that losing the Malfoy name is a hard loss, but surely-,"

"I have not lost the Malfoy name, Lucius," said Draco, for the first time in his life daring to interrupt his father.

Lucius stopped, startled that Draco would presume talk over him and completely at a loss to what Draco was saying.

"I kept the name, Lucius," Draco reminded him.

"It is not tied to me," said Lucius. "Legally, politically, financially, I have nothing to do with you."

"It is of no matter," said Draco. "My surname is still Malfoy and in regard to the mind of the public, I am still tied to you, no matter how faintly. Should you dare harm, or even think of harming Ginevra, I will tarnish my good name until I drag yours to hell with me."

Lucius' eyes flashed. "Do not provoke me, boy, for I will not be lenient to you. Do not think that you can speak this way in my presence without repercussions. There is nothing that would stop me from doing to you what I have done to those who have dared try the name of Malfoy. There is no pity or mercy for you."

"You think that I am still a child," said Draco. "You think that you could reach me when I have allies even the Dark Lord cannot touch. You are mistaken if you think you will intimidate me with threats, with stories of your past conquests."

"These are no threats," said Lucius. "You are still young, arrogant in your own self and in that fool of a Headmaster. Where was he when the school was attacked? Where was he when the Ministry nearly splintered? You are confidant, and you will fall, and if I am the hand that brings you down, than so be it. You will not harm the name of Malfoy."

His father's face was set, the grey eyes holding back a storm so furious, Draco felt chilled, but he pressed on, his own rage lending him strength.

"I shall if you do not hold to the stipulations I have given," said Draco. "I will have the name struck from every book, blotted from every record, spoken with far more revile than even that of the Dark Lord. Do not-,"

And then Draco stopped because Lucius had been staring at him, not at him, through him, but then Lucius glanced behind him and a voice was speaking, a light, feminine voice.

"Draco."

Draco knew that voice, shock stopping him cold. He prayed it wasn't her, slowly turning around and hoping against hope that he had been wrong. He was never wrong.

Ginny stood behind him and he stared. He couldn't help it; she looked stunning.

"Aren't you going to introduce me?" she asked.

"You think that I am still a child," said Draco. "You think that you could reach me when I have allies even the Dark Lord cannot touch. You are mistaken if you think you will intimidate me with threats, with stories of your past conquests."

Lucius felt a surge of anger tainted with frustration. How dare Draco talk to him this way? How dare he interrupt his own father?

Even if Lucius had been the one to severe the ties between them, he would have respect from the boy he had raised on his own. If nothing else, Draco should respect the position Lucius held, the experience Lucius had gathered in the years in which Draco hadn't existed. Lucius had power; in some cases, even more than the Dark Lord because the Dark Lord only moved in shadow. Lucius had influence in illegal affairs, and the legal ones. Lucius could, if provoked, retaliate against the impudence and arrogance his late son was displaying towards him. If provoked, he would not pull his blows.

He had known, from the minute he had heard of the collapse of Wren & Sons, that Draco had been involved. Draco's sensational reappearance in society had created a shockwave in all social circles and Lucius knew the two events, both occurring on the same day, were not mere coincidence.

He had also known that this was his late son's calling card. For some reason, one Lucius had yet to determine, Draco wanted to meet. Something had happened, something had sent Draco into a rage, and it was that something that had brought Lucius to the Triad. Draco would find him here, of that there was no doubt, and while he waited, he had toyed with guessing to what the reason would be.

Most teenagers, recently disowned, would seek some type of revenge, but Draco was not most teenagers; he understood the consequences of betraying his family. Draco was raised according to the Pureblood customs and traditions. No Pureblood son so brought up would implement a revenge when it was their own decisions that had caused their disownment. Draco had no right to do so, but that meant Lucius had no hint to what Draco was reacting against.

Lucius needed to know what had set Draco off. The collapse of Wren and Sons had been damaging. Not a lethal blow, no, not even close to such, but momentarily crippling. Lucius would walk out of the damage relatively unscathed, had already implemented a regime of actions that would pull Malfoy Enterprises away from the rubble, but to fully recover from the collapse, he needed to know what had caused it. He needed to know why Draco had caused this.

There was more to meeting Draco than simply protecting his finances. He didn't like to think of these reasons, but they whispered in the back of his mind whenever he sat in silence after a long day, they tainted his thoughts during menial tasks and when his concentration wandered. They invariably asked 'why?'

Why had Draco so easily turned his back on his family and heritage? Why had he allowed Lucius to disown him? Why had he denied the Dark Lord when he could have been his heir?

He knew that he would never fully understand unless he asked Draco himself, but he would never do such a thing. Draco had made his choice and so Lucius would wash his hands of the boy. Still, here was an insight into Draco's mind. Draco had reacted in anger, and if Lucius could figure out what had made Draco angry, then maybe this would be the key.

He had not expected the reason for Draco's anger to be for the sake of a woman. In all of his wildest speculations, he had never even come close to thinking that the woman would be a Weasley. It was worse than his son associating with a Mudblood.

The entire affair was ridiculous. It was more than ridiculous; it was completely nonsensical. A Malfoy and a Weasley? His son was supposedly a genius; this negated all of his claims.

And now his son was threatening him, disregarding Lucius' warnings of a full retribution. Lucius felt an inexplicable fury well up inside his chest. He wanted to do nothing more than to pull his wand right now and show the boy who was the superior, show him who had the real power. He could get away with it too, he knew, but it would go against the image he had so carefully wrought.

"These are no threats," said Lucius, restricting himself to words and not curses. "You are still young, arrogant in your own self and in that fool of a Headmaster. Where was he when the school was attacked? Where was he when the Ministry nearly splintered? You are confidant, and you will fall, and if I am the hand that brings you down, than so be it. You will not harm the name of Malfoy."

He willed his son to understand this. He had only disowned Draco the last time he had so blatantly betrayed his name; any more and Lucius would not hesitate to land a heavier blow.

"But I shall if you do not hold to the stipulations I have given," said Draco, not heeding his words. "I will have the name struck from every book, blotted from every record, spoken with far more revile than even that of the Dark Lord."

Lucius' hand clenched. How dare the boy be so impudent? So defiant? He would not-

There was movement behind Draco and he looked up. His glance clued Draco in as well, and his son trailed off.

The red-haired girl spoke, her voice light, pleasant. There was a genuine warmth to her tone that Lucius had not heard in a long while.

"Draco."

His son's eyes darkened at the voice, not in anger, but dread and apprehension. Draco turned, staring at the girl. Lucius cast a critical eye over what must be Ginevra Weasley.

The girl was, most importantly, dressed appropriately. The ivory cocktail dress she wore was fashionable, designed by one of the more established companies, the same company for whom the eldest Weasley's wife was employed. Secondly, the girl had vastly grown from the last time Lucius had seen her, when she was a mere wide-eyed, scraggly-haired first year.

She was of average height and attractively slender, but her skin was pale porcelain and not sun-kissed tan as the current fashion demanded. Her body was nothing extraordinary, but the ivory cocktail dress she wore was fitted like a glove, accenting the flat stomach and curve of her hips. The dress was strapless, revealing smooth, graceful shoulders any woman would be proud to claim. While her breast size was, again, nothing special, the low line of the dress revealed an enticing shadow of cleavage. The dress ended a few inches above her knees, revealing shapely legs and a pair of gold, high-heeled shoes.

Her face was pleasing, dark eyes and lashes contrasted to pale skin. Her nose was straight, but smattered with freckles that she did not conceal. Her lips weren't quite full, but her smile was genuine. She wore make-up, but only to enhance her natural features, which leant her a fresh beauty, one that no other woman in this room could attest to possessing. Her hair, pulled back in a sleek French twist, was a striking red that shone gold when it caught the candlelight.

Altogether she was a pretty girl, but Draco could have had any woman he desired. Why then this girl?

"Aren't you going to introduce me?" the girl asked Draco.

At first, Lucius expected Draco to refuse, but his son was far too well-mannered to make a scene in the Triad. Draco got to his feet and stepped over to the girl, kissing her on the cheek and then turning back to Lucius.

"Ginny," he said, "this is Monseigneur Lucius Malfoy."

His son did not introduce him to the girl. Draco didn't have to because, legally, they were not connected anymore and so etiquette said that while it was not remiss to complete the introduction, it was not necessary. It was obvious Draco did not wish the girl to speak with him. It was also obvious he had no idea the girl would be here.

"You will excuse us," Draco continued. "I do not seek to take up any more of your time. Ginny, shall we find a table?"

It was a flawless exit, one that conveyed all of the needed civility but left no room to think that the company was desired. Lucius was not going to let him leave, not when Draco had given the last word. When Draco left, if Draco left, it would be on Lucius' term; this would not be Draco's triumph. Lucius ignored the threat in Draco's voice and stood. He was Malfoy; he could overlook the real meaning in the exit.

"Please," he said, stopping the couple from turning away. He looked to the girl. "I did not mean to keep your beau from attending to you. Dine with me and excuse my ill manners."

Draco was startled. The grey eyes that were so like his own fastened to his face, the jaw set. Lucius ignored him and instead put on a small smile, holding out his hand. "I would be honored with your presence," he said.

He wondered, idly, if the girl would turn tail and run, but then again, she was a Weasley and born for Gryffindor and so he was not surprised when the girl met his smile with her own. She walked forward, letting him take her hand.

"Ginevra Weasley," she introduced herself. "The honor is ours."

Lucius bowed and kissed the back of her fingers.

"I have heard so much about you, Miss Weasley," he said, straightening again but not releasing her hand.

"Please, Ginevra," the girl corrected.

Lucius nodded and guided her back to the table, pulling out a chair and helping her in. He then walked around to the other side and reclaimed his own seat, raising an eyebrow to Draco who was standing protectively behind the Weasley girl but not making any move to sit.

Draco met his gaze and Lucius was surprised at the comprehension in the grey eyes. His son had read his ploy, knowing that to win back the advantage, Lucius needed to keep the two of them here. The surprise of Ginevra's arrival had taken them both aback, but it had worked to Draco's favor. Lucius had lost ground, much of it. His son's eyes were darkly triumphant, but this battle was far from over.

"How are your parents?" Lucius asked, turning back to the girl as Draco took his seat.

"My parents are quite well, thank you," said Ginevra. "I shall tell them you inquired."

It was a proper response, but there was a certain wicked light in her eyes which caused Lucius to think she really might tell them. He did not have to imagine what kind of havoc his inquiry would cause. He was rather surprised at the girl, though it did not show on his face.

"I hope you are having a good holiday so far," said Ginevra, continuing the small talk easily. "Do you have any plans for Christmas?"

"Yes," said Lucius, "I have been invited to spend the holiday with the Minister at the Burton Estate. A few other governors and various dignitaries will be in attendance as well."

"Sounds like quite the party," said Ginevra.

Lucius gave a charming smile. "It will no doubt be extremely trying, but I shall endeavor to endure it. I hope your own plans are less unpleasant."

"Draco and I will be spending Christmas locally."

"And how are you set to enjoy the festivities in hiding, Draco?" Lucius asked, turning to his late son with the first of many attacks. This was where real wars were waged, not in the battlefield, but in public, in plain sight. Not with curses and heavy blows, but with tiny remarks, small cuts that were strategically placed until the unsuspecting were drained dry.

"You just told me there was no need," said Draco. "What could possibly happen when the leading lacking is on holiday?"

Lucius raised his eyebrow in warning; Ginevra looked to Draco in surprise at the cutting tone.

"We will be celebrating with the family," she expounded.

"Ah, the family," said Lucius, still looking to Draco. "And just how are you getting along with the family?"

"Satisfactorily," said Draco, not affected at all by that jibe and not bothering to return his own.

"Draco is being modest," said Ginevra. "He and my family are getting along splendidly. He has even been made godfather to my nephew. Perhaps you've heard the news. Fleur, my eldest brother's wife, gave birth a few days ago to a boy, Lukas Arthur."

Lucius had heard about the birth, even though the news had not been broadcasted to the general public just yet (a birth in the Order would be a prime target for Death Eater attacks). He had not heard the name. His face did not show his shock at the name 'Lukas', but he did glance over to Draco whose face was a study of disinterest. He looked back to Ginevra, wondering if the girl knew the significance of the name. She was well aware, her eyebrows raised, intently watching his expression.

He knew he gave no emotion away, but the name had been a baited piece of information, spoken casually but with the intent to gauge his reaction, to feel him out. It was calculated and Slytherin and completely out of character for a Weasley. It seemed Draco might not be alone in the battle.

"Do pass on my congratulations," said Lucius as Benson approached the table again. Lucius turned to the server, giving his permission for the waiter to speak.

"Are the three of you dining together?" asked Benson.

"Yes," said Lucius.

"Very good, sir," said Benson, and then he distributed the menus. "The wine list is on the back. I will be return shortly to take your orders."

Benson nodded before once again hurrying away. Lucius knew that the management must be in uproar. It was not everyday that a respected patron met with his disinherited son and girlfriend, and never had a Malfoy and a Weasley dined together voluntarily.

He turned his attention to the menu, already knowing what he was going to order but surveying the options anyway. The Weasley girl was leaning over to Draco, asking for any recommendations. He listened to the two of them converse.

Ginevra spoke warmly, sometimes teasing, always smiling. Draco responded in the cool tones he had learned from Lucius, his eyes silently reproaching Ginevra for coming, but the inflections in his voice portrayed a level of attachment Lucius had not expected. The inflections were subtle, discreet, and Lucius did not expect anyone beside himself to read them correctly, but it was obvious that Ginevra did.

Lucius waited until the orders were taken, and until the soup was served before striking conversation again, and he directed the words to Ginevra. He knew that Draco did not like his father addressing his girlfriend; it was apparent in the way his shoulders tensed and how he watched the both of them carefully.

"You attend Hogwarts, I assume," he said to the girl, who was sampling the bisque.

She took the time to swallow, not at all embarrassed at being spoken to when her mouth was full, something which caused most refined women to blush and become flustered. He had wanted a flustered Ginevra; that would no doubt lead to an angry Draco.

"Yes," she said, patting her lips with her napkin and smiling at him. Smiling seemed to be a habit with her. "I'm in my sixth year."

"Any favorite classes? Other activities you enjoy there?"

"I am a Chaser for the Gryffindor team."

That explained the shapely legs. He gave a small smile.

"I hear your team has been doing quite well for the past few years."

"Yes, I think we are finally pulling together and learning to talk to each other on the field. It's great fun once everyone feels comfortable in their own position."

"It must be a great honor to fly with Harry Potter," said Lucius. "I hear he is easily five times the better flyer of any student in the school."

Draco spoke up at the veiled insult, like Lucius wanted him to, but his voice was neutral. "Five times is a little steep. I would definitely say he's twice as good as the rest of us, maybe three. What do you say, Ginny?"

"Two point four," she said, shooting him a smile.

Lucius had a faint feeling that she understood his dig as well, but continued anyway. This was the trick to the subtle art of verbal war. One small nick meant nothing, but after time, the nicks became grievous injuries.

"How does it feel to be on the guaranteed victor's team? It was much like that when I played in Hogwarts. Slytherin was having the record winning streak then."

"It isn't a guaranteed win. There are still injuries to worry about and if the other team has a better game strategy, it doesn't matter if Harry does catch the Snitch." Ginevra turned to Draco for confirmation.

"And some would say there is more to life than winning and fame," said Draco blandly, obviously uninterested in the conversation.

"Such as family?" asked Lucius.

He watched with satisfaction as the grey eyes flickered, but that was it. There was no real admission of the strike, and so any success was null.

"Yes," said Draco. "Family is important, but so is staying true to oneself, upholding the sacredness of all life, equality for all, not bowing the wishes of many when the majority is in error, and, above all, true love." Draco smirked. "I could continue with the list of over-sung sonnets, but I wouldn't wish to bore."

That last was directed to him, and Lucius was incensed. His expression never wavered.

"So you are a philosopher now as well as a translator and a businessman. I'm surprised you were not invited to the Minister's as well with such a repertoire."

"You flatter me," said Draco, voice still flat.

"I assure you, I do nothing of the sort," said Lucius.

The soup dishes were cleared away by a team of waiters, the appetizers served next. Lucius took a moment to collect his thoughts. Draco was doing an admirable job of not being drawn out into a verbal sparring match, merely batting away the slights that Lucius sent his way and it would not do. If Lucius wanted to deal a fitting blow, Draco would have to be engaged in the battle. If Lucius was to be the victor, he needed Draco angry, he needed him to be as frustrated and twisted as he was.

"I hear you will have an extended break," said Lucius, again looking to Ginevra. "You must be pleased for the extra holiday time."

"It isn't exactly holiday time," said Ginevra.

"Of course," said Lucius. "Forgive me for sounding so callous. The attack on your school was shocking."

"To some perhaps," said Ginevra, her lips twitching in the knowledge that she was speaking to one of those who had helped plan the attack. Lucius wanted her off-guard, not amused.

"I hear your brother was injured in the attack. I trust he is well now?"

"Yes, he has recovered quite well," said Ginevra.

"How splendid."

Lucius looked over to Draco to see a pale eyebrow rise with a smirk.

"Draco actually saved his life, so you can imagine how grateful my parents are to him. We're so happy to have him," said Ginevra. She reached over to lay a hand on Draco's knee, sending him a secret grin.

Draco looked over and something passed between them. Draco leaned in to press a light kiss on Ginevra's cheek but she turned into the kiss. It was a chaste gesture of affection, one that nearly put Lucius off of his meal.

"Pardon," Ginevra excused herself afterwards with a small blush.

"Oh, don't apologize on my account," said Lucius. "Young love is fleeting and should be cherished."

"It is only fleeting when it is unrequited," said Draco, finally coming out of his indolent attitude to strike back.

Lucius was not accustomed to such an attitude and the knowledge that he could do nothing but respond in words was grating. If this was any other antagonist, Lucius would already be plotting a retaliation at a later date, perhaps financial, perhaps physical, but Draco was not such. He had taught Draco too well, and the normal tactics would not work. This time, the retaliation would require deliberation when he was free to think.

"Perhaps," he allowed, conceding the point because by doing so he was taking away Draco's victory. "Do you believe yourself in love, Draco?"

He raised an eyebrow, daring Draco to lie and say yes. Nothing ruined relationships more than hasty proclamations of devotion.

"Oh, I don't think we're that serious," said Ginevra, speaking up and covering for her boyfriend. "We're more than friends, most definitely, but to say anything more I'm afraid would jinx us."

"Surely you do not hold such a fear, Draco," said Lucius. "A mind like yours fearing a superstition?"

"No," said Draco. "But I do not seek to be too hasty in my relationships or else I might make a mistake. I would not wish to be in a one-sided relationship, for example. I think life would be unbearable if I was with a partner I did not admire or love."

He smirked, raising his eyebrow in defiance. In his words he sited Narcissa as the one who was suffering in the marriage and Lucius clenched his fist which was out of sight. He would not give Draco the satisfaction of seeing the strike hit home. Draco knew far too much meaning he knew how to inflict the most damage. Narcissa…

But no, he hadn't thought of his wife for years now, and he wouldn't start. He had her, owned her, if not her loyalty, and he could force himself to be content with that. When that wasn't enough, he took pleasure in ruining her lovers.

The main course was served, Lucius noting the weak wine Draco received with his supper. No doubt Draco wanted to remain alert for the girl's sake and to remain on the defensive.

"Ginevra, how is your meal?" he asked after a brief interlude.

"Exquisite, thank you," said Ginevra. "I don't think I've had anything better. Is your own meal to your satisfaction?"

"It will suffice," said Lucius, "but I must take you to Compora sometime. It is a beautiful restaurant along the coast in France in the wizarding capital. The chef there is a true master."

Draco shot him an unimpressed glare which Lucius ignored.

"Tell me more about yourself Ginevra," he commanded.

"Oh, I'm sure it's not that interesting," said the girl.

"Nonsense," said Lucius. "What is it like to be a youth today, among the chaos of these changing times? I realize it causes some people to take leave of their senses, to behave irrationally."

"I would think it would be the opposite," said Draco. "What else challenges young minds to seek out the truth than the threat of death?"

"Surely you do not feel threatened with death," Lucius objected.

"No, not death, just the death of freewill."

"There is more to life than the will of an individual."

"That's an archaic form of thought. What do we own except our individuality?"

Lucius raised an eyebrow at the change in topic; the verbal spar had evolved into an ethical debate. The change was not unwelcome. It would offer another hint into Draco's reasons for severing ties with the Pureblood society.

"Free will does not denote individuality, just as tradition does not mutually exclude independence," he said. "Honor will always be greater than these."

"Honor or horror?" Draco asked.

Lucius frowned. "You are young, and your speech shows such."

There, right there. Lucius swore that he had not imagined the glimmer in Draco's eyes.

"I am not as young as you would think," Draco responded, his voice carefully neutral. He then looked up, meeting Lucius gaze the way an equal would which caused ire to flare up in his chest. Draco had once been his son and to express equality was an insult to age and the proper familial hierarchy. Yes, Lucius had removed Draco from the family, but he would still have the proper homage paid.

Lucius openly scoffed at Draco. "Your actions betray your age. You are still young and I am still unimpressed."

Draco's eyes sparked, his jaw clenching once before the indifferent smirk was plastered on his face again.

Lucius was confused. Why would these remarks hit so hard when he was clearly unaffected by the harder blows Lucius had given. He continued on that path, wanting to press his advantage while trying to understand.

"You will no doubt get far with your idealist notions now that such proclamations are heralded with trumpets and visions of glory, but I assure you, the generation of your elders is unimpressed."

Draco raised an eyebrow, but not out of anger at the remark. Rather, he appeared amused.

"Perhaps it is time for a revolution then."

"A revolution or rebellion?"

"The new generation always appears to be wayward and straying to the elder, but the world is still standing. Most would even say that it has improved."

"The improvements have nothing to due with your concepts of individuality."

"No?" asked Draco. "It seems to me they have everything to deal with it. Creativity in one decade alone has given the wizarding world more advancements than the entire reign of honor and familial pledges. In this case, the cause must be our awakening of self."

Lucius was quickly losing control of this conversation. He reverted back to the original comments that had Draco angry.

"And what of the deteriorations? You cannot forget these. I remain unconvinced and unmoved. More so than this, I am bored by your revolution. It is a fancy of youth and inconsequential."

Draco's eyes slid to the side as he leaned back in his chair. "So be it," he shrugged, but there was anger in his eyes.

Lucius continued, slowly realizing what had affected Draco so.

"I had thought that some were better raised than to fall into such false notions of grandeur."

Draco didn't flinch, but his eyebrows furrowed at the comment.

Lucius smirked, knowing now what had made Draco so angry. Draco only reacted when Lucius discussed his personal revulsion for the ideals Draco stood for, for the actions Draco had taken.

Lucius felt like laughing in victory. His son had tried so hard to appear his equal, had tried so hard to prove himself as independent from his father, but it was Lucius' disapproval that struck him the hardest.

Here was proof that his son held a devotion to him even though Draco had switched ranks. There was a flush of elation at this discovery, but something much more tangible, much more substantial. Lucius was pleased, content even in the continued fidelity of his late son. It no longer mattered that Draco had run to Dumbledore. Even though Lucius had thrown Draco out, the boy was still his, still wanted to be his, as it should be. The world was still right.

And now, the only thing that was left was to finish the battle, to leave his son completely defeated with the knowledge of his loss, broken on the battlefield.

"Still," said Lucius, "I have no doubt that society will come to its senses soon enough. And just in time too. I do not wish to raise my child in these turbulent times."

Draco's eyes shot to his face. It was a blatant lie, because Lucius hadn't even considered having another child with Narcissa, not when she had given herself so freely to others. Divorce was not an option, far too plebian and scandalous, but he would not be able to bring himself to kill her. It did not matter for she would kill herself soon enough with all of her drugs and wine and then Lucius would take another wife. Draco didn't need to know that.

He could tell that his comment had hit hard. He could see it in Draco's eyes. It was well-hidden, and no one else would read the emotion, but Lucius had raised Draco. He could see the pain beyond the storm, the betrayal. Good.

"And," he continued, "if such are the notions held by this generation, than I am pleased that I have none at this time."

Draco clenched his jaw. Ginevra was looking to him worriedly, and then sending glares his way, but Lucius wasn't going to be deterred. Draco looked to the dance floor, picking up his glass of wine.

It wasn't enough; Lucius wanted an open admission of his victory. He spoke again.

"Tell me, Draco, were you as happy to be free of me and my 'archaic' ideas as I was elated to be rid of a such a disappointment to the Malfoy name?"

Lucius was expecting anger to his words, an anger that he could manipulate to achieve the admission he desired. He was not expecting the outright flinch of Draco, the way his face paled and his hand shook oh-so-slightly as he hurriedly set down his glass of wine so that the scarlet liquid nearly sloshed over the edge.

"Draco," said Ginevra, her voice tight, reaching out to him but then stopping as Draco shifted from her touch.

Lucius watched it all, putting the pieces together: the one glass of weak wine Draco was drinking, the way he had nearly tipped over his glass to put it down, the faint flush of shame on his cheeks. He knew right then what had happened. Draco hadn't handled the disownment well. He'd either drunken himself into a stupor or tossed back a home-made drug cocktail.

There it was, the card Lucius could play, flaunting disregard and sneering superiority, laughing at the son who denied his father and then nearly destroyed himself. He could seal his victory, strike the final blow. Draco would not dare to challenge him after this.

The only catch was, to play the card, Lucius would have to pretend to be completely unaffected by the fact that Draco had turned to drugs. Unbidden, the memories of holding down his thirteen year old son, who was screaming in pain from withdrawal, rose to the surface of his mind. Lucius was not stone, like so many thought he was. He could not play the card and keep his mask of indifference, and if he tried and when he made his fatal flaw, Draco would be the victor.

They were in a stalemate then, neither of them able to let go of a non-existent tie between them, and neither being able to admit to it.

And so Lucius was silent, accepting the outraged look of horror and condemnation from Ginevra. Of course Draco picked that up. He had been tensed, expecting another comment, but as the seconds past and still Lucius said nothing, Draco looked up, confusion in his eyes.

The confusion slowly cleared as the truth dawned on Draco. Lucius had known what Draco had done, and he was not throwing it in Draco's face. Lucius couldn't use it, he couldn't use the fact that Draco cared for his father as a winning move because the link went both ways.

Draco didn't smile, but he did sit back in his chair, startled. His eyes cleared, the grey unfroze and a small smirk played at the corner of his mouth.

Lucius cursed himself for admission, not prepared to let Draco win this round even if he had been forced to admit, in his mind, that there was a bond between father and son.

The waiters came back to clear their dishes, pouring tea and coffee during the short intermission before dessert. On the dance floor a song ended and another began, a waltz.

Lucius stood and held out his hand. "Dance with me, Ginevra," he commanded.

The girl turned to him, obviously surprised.

"There is time until dessert, and I wouldn't wish to bore you," said Lucius. "All young women love to dance, do they not?"

Ginevra got to her feet, taking his hand even as Draco half-rose.

"Ginny," he said, his voice cool but the tone sharp.

"One dance," she said. "We'll be right down there."

Lucius guided her away before she could reassure her boyfriend any further. He walked briskly to the floor, Ginevra almost trotting to keep up, not prepared for the pace in her high heels. He pulled her into the dance before she had time to recognize the count of the song and she nearly fell into him, catching herself with her correct arm on his shoulder and then stumbling into step with him.

"I do hope we haven't bored you tonight, Ginevra," he said with a predatory smile. If he hadn't been able to get to Draco, he would have to be content with the girl.

"Not at all," she responded.

"And I hope he is behaving himself."

"A perfect gentleman." Her voice was slightly breathy, whether from the unexpected burst of activity or apprehension, he couldn't tell.

He twirled her, arm going over her head, not allowing her to recover her equilibrium.

"I doubt that. The relationship is quite sudden, isn't it?"

A quick two-step turn and glide.

"Yes, perhaps," she said, pulling in a quick breath.

"And you still say he has acted like a gentleman?"

He twirled her three times and then caught her, preparing to move back into the dance, but she stopped firm.

"Of course," she said, looking him straight in the eye as she found her balance. "I asked him out."

Lucius frowned. She had what?

He pulled her back into the dance, but taking the slow steps, weaving among the couples. Ginevra was proving to be almost as much of an enigma as Draco.

"Quite an interesting choice on your part. Your parents must have been displeased in your pick."

"Concerned, yes, but not displeased. They couldn't say no to Draco, not after his bout of heroics."

"So it's the fame you're after then."

Ginevra laughed. "If it was fame I was interested in, I would have gone after Harry."

"Money, perhaps?"

"I've learned to be content to just get by. Besides, Harry does have his own fortune to add to his appeal."

"You're left with explaining away your relationship as a fit of teenaged rebellion, my dear. At least pretend it was one of the other two."

"Who says it has to be for those three reasons?"

"You can not expect me to believe that you fell for Draco. His ties are less than appealing to a Weasley."

"Care to explain that?"

"You're a naïve little girl, Ginevra."

She laughed. "You can hardly think me naïve. You're forgetting my first year at Hogwarts."

"All the more reason to stay away or else a few unpleasant nightmares will return."

"I don't get nightmares," said Ginny. "Not about that, at least. I am still afraid of thunderstorms though."

"Not afraid?" asked Lucius. "Forgotten, perhaps?"

"Hardly," said Ginevra, looking straight up at him. He looked her in eyes, really looked, and he finally realized why she hadn't made any sense to him. He had thought she was merely a Weasley, but there was another presence in her gaze, a shadow rather than a substantial form.

Lucius knew who owned that shadow, had seen him yesterday afternoon in fact, and seeing it in the eyes of a sixteen year old girl caused him to freeze for the slightest of seconds before expertly guiding her between two couples.

"No exorcism is ever complete," said Ginny.

"It's not him," said Lucius. He recognized the difference.

"It's not Voldemort, if that's what you mean," said Ginny. "It's Thomas Riddle, the younger and slightly less maniacal version. You see now, don't you?"

"That doesn't mean a thing."

"It means I'm not in over my head, that maybe, just maybe I'll be a good match for him. Even if it doesn't prove it to you, you should know that I don't like to see him hurt. I wish to Merlin that he had never found out about you and the diary and Tom."

"You would have kept it from him."

"I would have, but he found out and he came here. I think it might have been good for him, for the both of you, but I don't want him to see you again. He gets morose."

"I'll see whom I wish."

"Yes, you will," said Ginevra. "I'll merely keep him from you."

Lucius raised an eyebrow, his mouth twisting up in a grim sort of smile. "You are a surprise, Ginevra Weasley." She was of no consequence to him and so he could afford to be slightly lax. Besides, the girl was practically a Slytherin in the Gryffindor house. Fate must have a sense of humor.

She frowned, confused at his lack of reaction to her revelation. He answered her question.

"I am not intimidated by your Thomas. Did you expect me to be?"

"Not intimidated," she admitted, "but not amused either."

"I am Malfoy," said Lucius. "Do you understand what that means?"

"I think I'm beginning to get an idea."

"Let me paint it clearer for you then," said Lucius. He pulled her closer so he could whisper in her ear. "It means I have a power your Thomas cannot control. It means that if I were to go after your family, I would not fail. Instead of a snake after your father, I would use a curse, one that never fails."

He could feel her tense and continued.

"Instead of a contingent of fools after your brother, I would go myself in the night. Instead of wasting time trying to build an army, I would strike first, when you were unprepared with no chance of defense."

"Why are you telling me this?" she demanded.

He gave her a smile. "So that you know, Ginevra. Keep your boyfriend away from me. I did only what was necessary the last time. If he forces my hand again, instead of a knife in his arm, I would put it-,"

She stumbled, grabbing onto his shoulder for balance, a pained gasp leaving her lips.

He steadied her. "Are you injured?" he asked, coming to a stop.

"I think I twisted my ankle," she said. "Serves me right for trying to dance in these shoes."

"Allow me to assist you to the table then," said Lucius, taking her arm.

She wasn't quite limping, but her steps were stilted. Draco was waiting for them at the top of the stairs, his eyes only on Ginny.

Lucius handed her over, aware of the parody in that motion. In the oldest of Pureblood traditions, the father always danced with the girl the eldest son was intending to marry, and during that dance he would quiz the girl, making sure she would make a suitable bride.

Lucius stared at his son, knowing that Draco would pick up the mirror of tradition as well and he waited, waited for the turn of Draco's head, the search for acknowledgement, approval.

Draco seemed to make a distinct effort to only look at Ginevra, as if telling himself not to turn to Lucius, not to seek out a sign of approval. Lucius continued to stare, willing the head to turn.

It was haltingly done, as if Draco was fighting the urge, but then the grey eyes slid up to his. Lucius smirked.

Draco flushed, immediately looking away.

It was a small victory but Lucius grasped onto it, unable to let this small consolation go. Draco steered his girlfriend back to the table as a waiter approached him, a letter in hand.

"This came for you sir," he said, handing over the card.

Lucius opened the message, skimming over the contents quickly. Normally such an emergency on his night away would have been met with resigned acceptance. Now Lucius was glad for the distraction.

He crossed over to the table because courtesy demanded that he give his regards.

"You must excuse me," he said without any formalities. "Some business calls my attention. Enjoy your night and put any remaining expenses on my tab. Farewell."

He didn't wait for Ginevra's startled well-wishes, or for Draco's cool nod, but turned on his heel and left.

At the lobby his coat was already waiting for him in the hands of a polished attendant.

"Shall I call up the Floo for you, or send for a car, sir?"

Lucius was much fonder of Apparating than Floo powder and the magically enhanced cars, but he glanced back towards the restaurant.

"Send for a car."

"Very good, sir. Would you like some tea while you wait, sir?"

"No," said Lucius, dismissing the man with a curt hand.

The porter rushed off and Lucius walked to the back of the lobby, striding past the elaborate powder and rest rooms and to the very last door, one not used by conventional guests. The door led through a long corridor of various management offices, still finely furnished. There was a door at the end of this hall as well and Lucius stepped through, coming out on a narrow, little used corridor that overlooked the dance floor. Across the floor was the dining area, but his usual table was empty.

Lucius frowned until he caught the flash of red hair. Draco and Ginevra were dancing, Ginevra not at all impeded by a twist ankle. Lucius wasn't surprised with the thought that she must have faked the injury to escape his threats.

They looked well together, moving fluidly among the other couples. They were conversing; Lucius could just make out the movement of their lips. Draco was not looking at Ginevra, his eyes always on the room around him, but his hand was wrapped more around her waist than the dance called for. Ginevra's eyes never left his face.

Draco turned her, his gaze straying from the dance floor up to the corridor where Lucius was standing. He stepped back quickly before he was spotted, not moving until Draco's eyes returned to the other partners. Lucius left the way he came; no doubt the car would be there soon.

Hi! So you're probably wondering what happened to me. Um, nothing, but as I explained in my profile, I've been imagining this scene, the battle between father and son, since the end of the first story when I decided on a trilogy. I thought it would be easy to write then, but it wasn't. To give you an idea of how hard it was, this chapter is 25 pages on word. I had an extra 46 of unused dialogue and descriptions that were either too subtle or far too obvious. Yeah...crazy right?

I realize maybe I went slightly anal with it all, but I'm really happy with the result. I am sorry it took so long, but I think it was worth it. How did you like it?

p.s. I won't be updating this Tuesday, but the week after. And the Latin that Lucius says is Hogwart's motto. I've always wanted someone to say it to Draco, and I really think it works.





16. Dates and Hangovers

Disclaimer: The sad truth is that I do not own Harry Potter, so I must borrow the characters and the world they reside in. The happy truth it, because I borrow them, I can pretend that this is the way things actually happened…

More good news: Freddie lives! After three and a half weeks, I got him back, but this chapter, and two others, didn't make it. After reconstructing this one, however, I think it turned out better than the original.

I'm sorry about the wait, but when I got Freddie back, it was exam week at college, and then I had to move back home for the summer and send out a dozen applications in hopes for a job as taking care of Freddie took a lot. Now I'm back and onto the chapter!

The sky was gradually shifting from black, to dark blue, to that light grey and pink fade in the east which meant the sun was starting to rise. It was cold, and Draco relished in the bite of winter air on his face, more than warm enough in his long dark coat. Ginny, whose dress was thin and whose accompanying short jacket was more for show than for use, had learned how a wizarding genius could get the temperature just right on a heating charm. Said wizarding genius was rewarded with a smile and a kiss.

Right now, Ginny was walking in that particular gait women have after a night in high heels, those careless, gliding, long steps where they don't quite pick up their feet and with the slight tremor of the ankle as they balance on the thin heel, causing their hips to sashay. It was sexy as hell, even more so because she had no idea how he enjoyed staring from behind as she walked.

"Don't tell me you're tired," she said, stopping so he would catch up. She suddenly narrowed her eyes. "Draco Malfoy, are you staring at my arse?"

Draco smirked. She glared at him, but despite the frown on her lips, she seemed to be pleased at the attention. She grabbed his hand and pulled him along, anchoring him at her side. He didn't complain, not even when she swung their arms as they walked. A few streetlamps flickered off and Ginny breathed in, staring up at the sky.

"This was fun," she said. "We should do it again sometime."

Draco's look said it all.

"Well, not all of it," she amended. "But the rest of it was fun."

It had been fun. After dancing and dessert, he taken her up to the roof, one of his favorite spots, and they'd gazed up at the stars, which were hard to see because of all the lights from the street, and stared down to see the couples leaving the club, Ginny laughing at some of their drunken antics.

From there Draco had taken her to a popular jazz lounge on the side streets where the undiscovered musicians awaited their big break. They had coffee to drink with biscottis to dip in. Ginny had then convinced him to take her to the ruins of Westgate Castle for some real stargazing. The castle was in the middle of nowhere, and was a popular magical tourist spot, but it was closed for the season. Ginny had told him there was no point to his being a genius if he didn't use it to get past Floo barrier wards every once in a while. Draco figured she had a point, and had properly adjusted the Floo to let them through.

He knew all of the constellations, of course, and pointed out a few, but simply staring up at the sky made them look different. They had Flooed to the Leakey Cauldron after that, to step back into the Muggle world, and Ginny had decided they should walk back instead of Apparating. It was a clear night, so Draco acquiesced. Along the way they had stopped at a twenty-four hour fish 'n' chips stand for a late dinner, or early breakfast.

Draco had eaten fish 'n' chips before, but only once or twice and so the novelty of the experience outweighed the grease on the food. They'd stopped off at a small playground to eat on the swings, and then Ginny had gone down the slide a few times, and then they resumed their trek home. They were close now.

"I'm surprised your parents let you go," he said.

"Me too," Ginny laughed. "But they couldn't really stop me, not after we'd been keeping-,"

Draco must have flinched, or tightened his grip on her hand or something because she cut herself off.

"Anyway," she continued, "Pansy was pretty certain where you went, and Fleur had this dress she was designing, so it was like I was supposed to run after you."

There was silence for a few moments before she spoke up again.

"Are you glad tha-?"

"Yes," he said, before she had finished asking the question. "Yes."

"Good," she said. "Pansy took me there, you know, but right after she spotted you, she saw Antony someone-or-other and ran off."

Draco's lips twitched.

"And that place," Ginny continued, "is…," she trailed off, looking for a word.

"It's a bit much," Draco agreed.

"That's an understatement," said Ginny. "It was fun but I don't think I'd want to go there on a regular basis."

"Nor would I," Draco agreed. It wasn't just the décor and atmosphere, it was the knowledge that, even if she hadn't been aware of it, people had been watching. They were always watching in there. Every move, every gesture. Even living his privileged life was not enough to make an exhibitionist out of himself.

Ginny giggled and he looked over, arching an eyebrow.

"Nor would I," she repeated back to him, affecting a posh tone. "Do you have any idea how priggish you come off sometimes?"

He didn't know how to answer. If it was Bill, he would shrug and probably agree without any concern for how he might be perceived. If it was anyone else, he'd shoot a comment back. Ginny was different though, and so he hesitated.

She tugged on his hand, pulling him closer to her.

"It's…endearing actually."

Well, good then, he supposed. He offered her a small quirk of a smile.

"Have I told you tonight that you look beautiful?" he asked.

"Mmm, yes, I believe I recall you mentioning something of the sort when we were dancing."

"I said you looked lovely then."

"On the roof?"

"Fetching."

"The jazz lounge."

"Stunning."

"Watching the stars."

"Breath-taking, but you just having me repeat compliments now, aren't you?"

She smiled. "Maybe."

"Well, you do," said Draco. "Every one of them."

He watched in never-ending fascination as her smile sweetened, pleased and flattered and slightly shy all at once. Her emotions were always visible; he was addicted to watching them change, feeling a sort of flush when he knew he was the cause of a smile or a blush.

She squeezed his hand, and then they were turning down the street. He stopped her before they walked up the front steps, needing to tell her before they were back. He had wanted to tell her the entire night, but now the words had escaped him. She waited patiently.

"I'm glad you came," he started haltingly. "I'm glad because it was fun tonight, and you look amazing, and I think that if you hadn't come…," but that wasn't the right way to say it, so he tried again. "I know it doesn't matter now, because everything turned out fine, and I'm not saying that it wouldn't have if you hadn't…," and there he was losing the point he was trying to make.

Ginny squeezed his hand. "I understand," she said. "You're glad I came, because it helped and we had fun tonight, but at the same time, you wish I hadn't because you didn't want me to meet Lucius and anything could have happened."

Draco nodded, relieved that she understood what he wasn't quite saying. "Tonight could have ended very differently."

"You really think so?"

Draco let out a breath, shrugging. "I can never tell with him."

"There was a lot more going on then I was aware of, wasn't there?"

"If you're aware of that then you probably picked up a good deal of it."

"I couldn't even tell who won."

Draco shook his head. "No one ever wins against Lucius Malfoy. You do your best to survive, and I suppose that's a victory in itself." He let out another breath, feeling tension dissipate slowly.

Ginny yawned, and they turned together towards the house, entering silently. No one was up, which Draco was thankful for, but as they made their way through the dining room there were footsteps on the stairs and Bill appeared, looking exceedingly tired.

Bill looked to Draco. "Are you-,"

"Yes," said Draco.

"Did you-?"

"Yes."

"How did-?"

"Fine."

Bill nodded, then turned to Ginny. "Have a good night?"

"Yeah," she answered.

"Good," said Bill. He turned back to Draco. "Are you sure-?"

"Yes."

"Good," he said again. "You do realize we'll talk more in the morning?"

"Yeah," said Draco.

"Alright," said Bill. "To bed, both of you."

They didn't protest. Draco just managed to change into a pair of pajama pants before falling in bed. He was asleep within seconds.

Being an insomniac meant that even after staying up all night, he didn't sleep for more than a few hours, and so at eleven, he was walking down the stairs, showered and dressed, and prepared to face the rest of the household. He was not prepared for a small child to run into his arms.

"Uncle Draco!" Laney cheered.

Draco blinked. "Laney?" he asked. "How…why?"

"Bill Flooed us," said Sam from the kitchen doorway, a mug of coffee in her hands. Sirius was beside her. "He said you could do with some family."

Draco looked over to the red-haired man who was holding Lucas in his arms. Bill smiled.

"Don't think this means we're not going to talk," he said.

"Of course not," said Draco.

"I'll get you some breakfast," said Sam. "You must be hungry."

"I could eat," Draco allowed.

"I could eat too," said Laney.

"You already had breakfast."

"I could have some hot chocolate," said Laney.

"Alright," said Sam, returning to the kitchen. Draco frowned as Sirius followed her in, offering to help.

"She likes him," Laney whispered to him.

Draco didn't respond to that.

Ginny came down a few minutes later, her hair still wet from a shower. It was apparent she had already been downstairs because she wasn't surprised to see Laney and when Sam returned with a breakfast plate for Draco, she had one for Ginny too.

"Thanks, Sam," said Ginny, taking the seat next to Draco. "Did you sleep well?"

"Fine," said Draco. "You're up rather early considering."

"Fred and George went into insane brother mode and woke me up when they got up just to be sure I was okay. Then, after I fell back asleep again, Ron came in followed by Dad and Mum. I figured I just wasn't meant to sleep today."

"Sorry," said Draco.

"Not your fault," said Ginny. "I ran after you, remember? So, what are your plans for today?"

Draco looked over to Sam and Laney. Sam spoke up.

"Laney hasn't seen the Wizarding Zoo, and being a vet myself, I think it might be an interesting sight to see."

Draco could think of several good reasons not to take them to the zoo, the first being the attack on their house by Death Eaters, but Sirius seemed to recognize his hesitation.

"Dumbledore's offered to come along," he said.

Draco raised an eyebrow. While the Headmaster's presence would prevent any Death Eater attacks, for some reason he couldn't see the old man taking the time to do such a mundane thing as accompany them to the zoo.

"Could we?" asked Laney, turning to Draco, eyes wide. "Can we go to the zoo?"

Draco couldn't deny those bright blue eyes so he shrugged. "Don't see why not," he said.

Laney turned to Ginny. "Are you coming as well?"

"I think we might as well make it a party," said Bill. "The more the merrier."

And the more people the better the protection. Draco met Bill's gaze and nodded.

"So," said Sam, turning to Draco. "You and Ginny were both out late last night, were you?" She raised her eyebrows, the unspoken question clearly annunciated with that expression.

Draco inwardly sighed. Ginny smiled and turned to Draco as well.

"We're dating," he said.

Sam burst into a grin and Laney cheered.

"I totally called that," Sam crowed to Sirius.

"No," said Sirius. "They've just started, how did-?"

"At the Hogwart's infirmary. I saw it and told him, didn't I, Draco?"

Draco rolled his eyes. "You may have mentioned something about it."

"No man can resist a red-head," Sam confirmed. "My one wish in life was to have red-hair."

"I don't know," said Sirius, "I like your hair." He reached up to tug a strand of it, shooting her a private smile and Draco set down his fork a little loudly. He raised an eyebrow when Sirius looked over.

"Right," said Black. "How about we go move into the kitchen where your dangerous half-brother-in-law can't see me to kill me."

"There are several spells for looking through walls, Black," said Draco. "I know them all."

"Ginny," said Sirius, "would you mind keeping your boy in line, and away from his wand?"

Ginny grinned. "I'm sure I can think of a few things we don't need magic for," she said with a sly look in his direction.

The adults laughed and Draco felt his cheeks flush.

"Eww, cooties," said Laney.

Draco should have known by now that it was impossible, when residing with the Weasleys, to have the experience known as a small, relaxing outing. Once news spread of a zoo trip, Harry had joined as he had never seen the wizarding zoo, and where he went, Ron and Hermione followed. Fred and George tagged along, it was that or straighten up their room, according to Mrs. Weasley, and the left Charlie with Fleur and little Lucas. From the expression of relief on Fleur's face, she could do with some peace and quiet, and Charlie still hadn't got over his cold.

"Go," he said. "Go and let me have an afternoon of peace, please." His odd intonations showed just how much his nose was stuffed up and made the last two words nearly indistinguishable.

Pansy tripped in the door at that moment, her coat hanging off one shoulder and her hair in an attractive, I've-just-had-sex disarray. She was grinning widely, swinging her purse by the gold strap.

"Hello!" she trilled, lilting into the dining room. "How are you? Draco, I missed you last night, I had to catch up with Antonio. How did the face off go with Lucius? Did you tell him to shove it up his arse?"

Draco stared at her.

"Well, you should have," said Pansy. She dropped into a chair at the table.

"Pansy, I swear to you, the day I wish to die an excruciating death, is the day I will tell Lucius to shove it up his arse," said Draco. He turned to Laney. "Don't swear; it's bad manners."

Laney giggled and Pansy finally seemed to take note of the group.

"Are we having a party?" she asked. "I adore parties. Just give me an hour to recuperate and another glass of wine to get rid of the hangover I feel is coming."

"We're going to the zoo," Laney informed her.

"The zoo?" Pansy asked.

"The place where they have the animals," said Ginny helpfully.

"Never been," said Pansy.

"You've never been to the zoo?" asked Ron in disbelief. "What about when you were a kid?"

"Debutante schools, high class social affairs, dances, afternoon tea with the Minister's wife…really no time for the animals."

"You should come," said Laney.

"Oh, I don't know, honey," said Pansy, patting the girl's hand. "I would hate to set a bad example."

"You might want to try changing out of the dress then," said Sam dryly.

Pansy looked down. "Oh," she said. "Good point."

The dress was a sapphire blue and Draco knew that a host of charms were keeping her from, well, spilling out.

Draco raised an eyebrow. "You aren't really coming to the zoo."

"Hell no," said Pansy. "If all of you are leaving, I'm going to shower and sleep this hangover off." She turned to Laney. "Listen," she said, "word of advice from the older generation to the younger, if an Italian wizard ever wants to show you a few tricks he's learned without the aid of his wand, don't do six shots before hand because you will want to feel every bit of bliss that wizard can make you feel. When you come to, that's when you can take the shots so you can start all over again."

"Laney," said Draco, "if an Italian wizard ever wants to show you a few wandless tricks, he will find out exactly why the semiviri curse is Dark Magic, and if you ever do six shots or have to come to, you will be shipped off to Switzerland where you will be initiated into the Charity Witches Coven where you will distribute bread to the poor until you are forty-five. Pansy, how about you go upstairs and take a shower?"

Pansy laughed and gave a wink to Laney. "Come visit when you're of age, I'll show you how to party." She got up, passing by Draco to run her hands through his hair. "I've always loved your hair," she said, and then leaned in to take a deep breath of the spiced shampoo he used.

"Are you going to make it upstairs?" Draco asked.

"Watch me," said Pansy, and she proceeded to flaunt up the steps. Draco wondered how she did it, drunk and in stilettos.

He reached up, trying to settle his hair into place. Ginny laughed and reached over to help him.

"Is she a friend of yours, Draco?" Sam asked, frowning after the Slytherin.

"Ex-girlfriend," Ginny supplied.

"I think we need to have a talk later," Sam said.

At that moment the Floo flared up and Dumbledore arrived. Draco didn't think he would ever curse the man's sense of timing again.

"Shall we?" Dumbledore twinkled.

Draco ended up paying for everyone's admission into the zoo, not because he was particularly philanthropic, but because everyone was either related to or dating someone else in the large group, they ended up stalling at the booth trying to figure out who would pay for who, who owed who what, and who was actually going to be paying for so-and-so's present, so count this as early payback. Not only were they a large group, but in the group was Harry, Dumbledore, and

himself, and they were attracting a lot of attention, so Draco shoved past the rest and slapped down his Gringott's charm. He turned to glare at the lot and jerked his head.

"Go," he said pointedly, and then turned back to the admissions officer while the transaction took place.

The Gringott's charm worked much like a debit card, where funds were immediately removed from one account and sent to another, but using charms instead of electronics. The cashier was efficient, and so Draco was soon passing through the gates to join the rest.

The zoo was thankfully climate controlled, and so coats were soon shrunk and pocketed all around. Laney was immediately running to the first exhibit, and Fred and George took it upon themselves to regress ten years and join in on her enthusiasm. Harry looked just as awed as Laney did and Hermione gave them all lectures on the animals they visited with textbook proficiency.

Draco hung further back, eyes constantly glancing between the party and the rest of the zoo. The other visitors stared as they walked by, and there were a few pointing fingers and whispers, but so far no threatening gestures.

Dumbledore hung back and fell in step beside him. Draco didn't acknowledge his presence.

"It's a beautiful day," said the Headmaster. The old man was too used to Snape's glowering silences to be put off by Draco's wary stillness.

"The weather charms are quite beautiful this time of year," he blandly agreed.

Dumbledore chuckled; Draco turned and raised his eyebrow. Dumbledore acquiesced by getting straight to the point.

"Were you aware of Grimmauld Place before being inducted into the Order?"

"Do you think the Death Eaters are aware of the building?" Draco countered. If so, he was sending Laney and Sam home this moment. He could Apparate them straight to London International Portkey Depot and have an emergency portkey setup within twenty minutes. He would then accompany them home to be sure that all of the proper wards were in place.

"There have been reports of seemingly random magical burglaries in homes that have ties to Order members," said Dumbledore.

"You think they are looking for the Headquarters."

"It is a possibility," Dumbledore allowed. "They do have the cloak of Merlin."

Shit, so they did. Draco had nearly forgotten about the magical cloak which allowed the wearer to pass through any sort of ward.

"I had known of the house," said Draco. "But knowing of it, and knowing where it is and how to get in are several different things. I'm right in assuming the location has changed from when the Blacks owned it, yes?"

"Yes," Dumbledore agreed.

"I had also thought that the house was unfit for human use. Dark magic homes have a tendency of deteriorating when left uninhabited."

"It nearly was, when we first moved in. Would it be possible to track the house?"

Draco frowned, looking through books in his mind.

"For an exact location, you would need to have the inheritance books, which should be in the house?" The end was a question.

"Yes, the books are in the library."

"That doesn't mean they couldn't find it, just that it would be more difficult. I could work out a more exact method of finding the Headquarters when we get back," said Draco.

"No, don't trouble yourself," said Dumbledore. "I have ways of dealing with the situation myself. I was just wondering if you had run across any copies of the books. If any place were to have illegal information, I have no doubt it would be the Malfoy Library."

"It would," Draco agreed.

They walked in silence for a few moments, watching Fred and George swing Laney in the air as she laughed and then watching the couple beside the harpie cage as they stared. Their group was getting quite the following, but so far people were just pointing with their fingers and pulling out cameras, not wands.

"I don't suppose you've read anything on Horcruxes, have you?" Dumbledore asked casually. Far too casually.

Draco kept his eyes on the visitors, not betraying his interest. "No. I hadn't even heard of them until last year. I've been gathering information as I go, but so far I haven't seen any real detailed information. Was there something in particular you were looking for?"

"No," said Dumbledore. "Again, just wondering if the Malfoy Library had anything more on the subject."

"Lucius kept several books in his study. I've never had the chance to look through them, but they were ancient Dark Magic books. They could have details about the Horcruxes, but I can't say for certain."

Dumbledore nodded, getting a thoughtful look on his face.

"I'm sorry I'm not anymore help," said Draco.

"Don't be sorry at all. It's a terrible thing when children so young learn of such dark objects."

"I'm hardly a child, Headmaster."

"To some," Dumbledore replied infuriatingly. "To some."

And then he drifted over to Sirius' side and the conversation was over. Draco scowled and turned to survey the visitors again. Ginny walked back to him and reached out a hand. He took it.

"Relax," she said, smiling.

"I am."

"Liar."

But that was all she said, so Draco fell in step with her and turned his attention to the furry animals in the cage before them.

Charlie was sick.

His head ached, his nose was stuffed, and breathing through his mouth made his throat sore, or rather, sorer than it already was. He was looking forward to a day with the house to himself because that meant wearing his flannel pajama pants and his old, torn MySpell t-shirt (classic rock all the way!), crashing on the couch with the latest Bret Henderson mystery novel, and listening to some soothing freestyle jazz on the radio. There was plenty of lemon tea and honey, thanks to his mother, and some soup he could simply heat with a spell.

So he made sure Fleur and Lucas were all right, from the doorway as he hadn't wanted to infect the baby, and then went straight for his room to change into his comfort clothes. After adding a thick pair of socks, he started down the hall, book in hand. It was then he heard the unmistakable sound of retching from the bathroom. It must be Draco's friend Pansy. From what he understood, he and Pansy had been together on and off throughout Hogwarts, but nothing had ever been serious between them.

He stopped and knocked on the door.

"You alright?"

There was another round of retching and he opened the door. Pansy was kneeling beside the toilet, manicured hands gripping the porcelain. A towel was wrapped around her body and her hair was wet from her shower and falling over her face. Charlie grimaced and stepped forward to pull her hair back, and quickly turned away as she threw-up again. When the heaving subsided, he looked back.

"Alright?" he asked.

The girl was pale, but she nodded, turned green, and heaved again.

"Must have been some party, huh?" he asked.

"Never been able to stomach whiskey," she said, voice huskier than normal. She reached over to pull the flush.

"You've, uh, got some in your hair," said Charlie, gingerly holding out the ends of her hair.

She groaned, but scooted over to the tub, turning the faucet on and dunking her head under. She groped for her wand, which he handed over, and she performed a few cleaning charms on her hair, and then the standard mouth-washing spell. She spat into the tub, rinsed her mouth again, made sure her hair was clean and then shut the tap off.

Charlie stood by as she wrung her hair out and was able to catch her elbow as she swayed when she finally righted herself. He'd been partier himself in his school days, still did party with his friends back at the Dragon Caves, and knew what a hangover could do to one's balance.

"Thanks," she said, and he didn't know how she managed to smile at him, or how she managed to wink as well. He was surprised even further when she picked up her bag from the floor, her dress lay discarded on the tiles as well, and proceeded to take out a complete make-up store from a minuscule handbag.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Mmm," she said, picking through the various boxes and tubes and pencils and Merlin knows what. She made a face at her reflection in the mirror, her hand rising to try to run through her hair.

Honestly, Charlie didn't know what the problem was. She was a stunning girl, even without the make-up, and no one should look that good hung-over. She looked downright sexy.

Her skin was flawless and tan, her eyes dark and lashes full, even without the charms. Her lips were pink and pouting, her hair was perfectly long and wavy. He already knew, from the scanty clothes she liked to wear, and from looking at her now (the towel revealed an ample amount of cleavage and stopped mid-thigh) that she had a body better than some of the pin-ups he had in his room as a teenage boy.

She was not happy though, that was apparent by her heavy sigh. She stepped back to open the drawer under the sink, but her foot stepped in her silky dress, and she slipped. Charlie was right there to catch her.

She grabbed onto him for balance, resting her head back on his shoulder before turning towards his neck.

"Mm, you smell good," she said, eyes closed.

Charlie figured she was pretty out of it.

"Let's get you back to your room, huh?" he asked.

She turned fully and wrapped her arms around his neck. "Okay," she said.

Charlie gazed at himself helplessly in the mirror. One thing at a time.

He walked her carefully back to her room and set her gently on the bed. He rifled through her dresser, figuring she wouldn't mind if he did see her matching black lace underwear and bra set, complete with fishnets and garters (a teenager's wet dream), because most of the time it was visible anyway. He was looking for something like he was wearing, worn and comforting without the threat of anything falling out, but all he came across were skimpy silk shirts and short skirts.

"I'll be right back."

He went to his room and grabbed a pair of flannel pajama pants and another t-shirt, George Roman this time (a wicked jazz guitarist who had started out with the classic rock band The Riders, but after the band disbanded, came out with a breakthrough album introducing his electric guitar and heavy distortion to the jazz classics). When he came back, Pansy was sitting exactly where he had left her.

"Here you go," he said, and then pulled the shirt over her head. She was aware enough to put her arms through the sleeves, and then he helped her up. The shirt was longer than some skirts she wore, falling to mid-thigh, and so he pulled the towel off of her without any embarrassment and helped her into the pajama bottoms.

"All set?" he asked.

She nodded and sat back on the bed.

"Good," he said, and turned to leave.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"Sitting on the couch with tea, a book, and light jazz," he said.

"Sounds good," she said, and held up her arms like a child.

Charlie was a good-natured, easy going, caring sort of man, so he picked her up, bridal style, and carried her down the stairs to the living room. Working with dragons meant a lot of heavy lifting and physical exertion, so even though he was sick, carrying her was easy. It also helped that she was slender, no doubt from strict dieting.

So Charlie did have his afternoon of reading, sipping tea, and listening to light jazz; he just had some company too. Pansy curled up, leaning heavily on his shoulder for the first three chapters, falling asleep and drooling a bit on his shirt (he didn't mind at all). By chapter four she was shifting about, no doubt feeling a bit of strain in her neck, so Charlie pulled a pillow onto his lap and helped her lie down. He stroked her hair while reading because hair that soft should not be neglected. At chapter nine, she seemed to come into consciousness a little more and drifted in and out while resting against his chest.

It was then that the group came back from the zoo, laughing and talking loudly. Pansy groaned and tried to bury her head further into his sternum and he chuckled and took up stroking her hair again, which earned him a luxurious groan of approval that sounded frankly pornographic.

Footsteps sounding in the hall caught his attention and he looked up to see Draco Malfoy walking past, obviously going into the study that had been set up for his use, but the teen glanced in as he walked passed and he froze, eyebrows rising.

"Pansy?" he asked. There was a hint of incredulity and concern in the cool tone. He stepped into the room, eyebrows furrowing.

"Mmff," said Pansy succinctly, waving him away with a flop of her hand.

It was obviously less than reassuring because Draco took one step closer. "Are you ill?"

"No, just hung over," said Pansy, into Charlie's chest. "I drank whiskey."

It was said as if that was supposed to answer all of Draco's questions, but the kid didn't leave.

"But why-?" he started, but Pansy turned over, pushing her tangled hair away from her face.

"This is what you would have woken up to every day if you had proposed to me like you parents wanted you too."

Charlie stared in surprise. That was a bit of interesting information, and suddenly he found himself scrutinizing the Slytherin with a more than critical eye.

Draco shook his head. "There are beauty spells for night," he said. "You know them."

"But I would have gotten sick of using them," said Pansy. "Not everyone is as perfect as you, you know?"

"I'm not perfect," came the quick response, but Pansy seemed to be irritated.

"Oh, come on," she said. "Name one time you've had a bad hair day, or went to class hung over, or had bags under your eyes. Name the one time you haven't been in perfect control of yourself or had all of the answers. I don't always look perfect, alright? Get over it!"

Draco stared, blinking once, but keeping silent. His fingers were tapping together in some sort of pattern as he regarded her with that unreadable expression.

"I've just never…," he started. "I was…concerned, but apparently my apprehensions are unfounded. I did not mean to imply that you were looking bad – I've told you a thousand times that you never needed the charms – and I apologize for any offense you might have taken. I hope you feel better."

Charlie met Draco's measuring gaze, and then the boy was turning sharply on his heel and walking to the door. He stopped before he reached the hall and looked back.

"I don't always have everything under control," he said to Pansy. "I suppose you have yet to be informed of my condition when I first arrived here." And then he was stepping out and turned the corner, disappearing from view.

Pansy groaned and ran her hands through her hair. "I don't suppose that was called for," she said, obviously referring to her snap.

"Maybe not," said Charlie.

"What did he mean, condition when he first came here?" asked Pansy.

Normally Charlie would be loathed to speak of the events that had occurred, but it seemed as if Draco had almost given him permission, so he explained.

"He was high or coming down from a hit. It was after he'd been disowned, and Bill half-carried him back here. He spent the first day locked in a bedroom as he detoxed."

Pansy stared, eyes wide. "Draco?" she asked. "Draco uses drugs?"

Charlie shrugged. "From what I understand, his mother introduced him to Angel-Flight when he was younger without his knowledge, and getting disowned just tipped him over the edge."

Pansy still looked shocked, as if she had just learned that Voldemort was giving up his diabolical ways to fulfill his life-long dream of becoming a go-go dancer in Vegas.

"For two people who were supposed to get married, you don't really know a lot about each other, do you?" he asked.

Pansy settled back down, leaning against his shoulder. "We know each other's public personas intimately," she said. "The rest never really mattered before."

And that was one of the most tragic things Charlie had ever heard. Pansy sighed and closed her eyes. Charlie brushed through her hair once and turned back to his book. He wanted to know if the hero got the girl in the end.

Sooo, originally I wanted Ron with Pansy, but she just seemed to click with Charlie. I think she needs someone a little more stable and comfortable affectionate. What do you think? Leave one!





17. PreChristmas Chaos

Disclaimer: Not mine.

Author's note: Sorry this is late. Real life is hectic like you wouldn't believe right now, what with my job starting and trying to reconstruct this chapter and etc. I also didn't get a chance to edit this really well or reply to reviews, but thanks so much to all of you, you've been a great encouragement, and hopefully next week will be vastly calmer. Thanks again!

Sam and Laney stayed two more days. It was different, being with the two of them, and not just because they were related - however so slightly. Sam and Laney didn't really know him, and because of that they had heard of, but were not familiar, with the stigma that came with the name 'Malfoy'. Because they didn't know his past, or his family heritage, he found he was freer to express himself. Not that he burst into peals of laughter, or anything, but he held Laney's hand when they went to the museum, and he smiled (almost) when he and Sam went out for coffee just to talk, mostly about Lukas and how Laney was doing at her new home.

Sam and Sirius went out a couple of times as well. Draco figured Sam could do worse, but he didn't think the relationship was exactly feasible at the moment. After all, they were an ocean away, but he wasn't going to begrudge her any happiness.

As much as he had enjoyed the few days with him, the constant presence of others grew tedious. It wasn't that he was anti-social, he was just emotionally distant and overly socially conscious, something that had served him well in the high social circles, but when it meant dealing with close-knit family and friends, he was largely at a loss. It didn't help that Pansy had finally moved in with Blaise, leaving Draco completely alone in the house of Gryffindors. So when he saw Sam and Laney off after a large good-bye dinner, it was with a mixture of regret and relief. He immediately escaped to his study and began working on his neglected projects.

Bill came in later that evening, gently bouncing Lukas on his shoulder.

"Busy couple of days?" he asked.

"Mm," said Draco, not even bothering to deign proper English on that question.

Bill laughed, crossed over to him, and placed Lukas in his arms. Draco tried to refuse, but it wasn't as if he could just let the baby fall to the floor. He glared at Bill while gingerly holding the infant.

"You're his godfather," said Bill shrugging.

Draco made a face at the tiny bundle in his arms. Lukas was incredibly round for a regular baby, but taking into account his Veela heritage (full-blooded Veela were actually grown in an egg-like shell in the mother's womb), he was actually a bit on the scrawny side. He would become more regularly baby-shaped as time wore on.

Bill pulled out the chair across from him and sprawled in it, regarding Draco with amused hazel eyes. Draco ignored him for the first few minutes, keeping his eyes on Lukas and looking for any signs of discomfort in case he was holding him wrong and making sure the baby wasn't suddenly going to flail and slip out of his grasp. He gradually relaxed when the baby seemed content to stare up at him. Normal babies could see much at all when they were first born, but again, Lukas was part Veela and he seemed to find Draco's face interesting enough.

"Ginny says that your meeting with Lucius went well, all things considering," said Bill.

Draco risked looking up. "That seems to sum it up."

He looked back down again, checking on Lukas, paranoid.

"I doubt it," said Bill. "I know you. Things always have double meanings, sometimes triple meanings. You could have had five different conversations, and the rest of us would only pick up on one or two."

Draco sighed, and then found that if he cradle Lukas with his left arm, and gently held onto Lukas' hands with his right, he could feel if the kid was squirming and readjust his grip. He looked up with Bill, shifting in his chair to get more comfortable.

"It could have gone badly. As it is," he paused to shrug, "I don't know what held Lucius back."

"What do you mean?" asked Bill.

Draco shrugged. "I don't really know what I mean."

"You don't know, or you don't want to think about it?"

Draco grimaced. "I don't want to think about it."

"Why not?"

"I obviously have reasons, but I don't want to think about those either."

"You can't just shove it away," said Bill.

"Watch me," Draco muttered, more to Lukas than Bill.

"Are you scared?" asked Bill.

"What?"

"Are you scared to think of the reasons Lucius had for holding back?"

"No. I just might be wrong about the reasons."

Draco saw the lift in Bill's eyebrows, the expression that meant he had already guessed the answers.

"You think Lucius held back because he cares about you," said Bill.

Well, if he had already said it…

"I can't think of any other reasons," said Draco shortly. "And it's driving me insane because there has to be something else, but nothing else fits the way…I can think of a few compound reasons, but he's never let them affect him before…I just…," he trailed off.

"What do you want the reason to be?" asked Bill.

"That has nothing to do with it."

"It has everything to do with it. Draco, it's okay to want him to care about you. It's okay to think that maybe you're the reason."

"I could be wrong, Bill. I'm not infallible."

"And you don't want to be wrong on this," said Bill. "You don't want to invest yourself too deeply."

"I'm not invested. Disowned, remember?"

"Draco, he's your father."

"Not anymore."

"Only officially. You said yourself it only makes sense that he was holding back because of you. Obviously the legal system doesn't have a say on blood relations, only in name."

Draco shook his head, pushing away that bit of hope. "There's bound to be another reason."

"Draco," Bill paused, let out a breath, and then seemed to find the words. "Draco, it's okay to want to be the reason. It's okay to want him to care about you."

"I don't-," Draco started, but Bill wasn't finished.

"And just the same, it's okay for you to care about him."

"No, it's not. Not after…just no. Not anymore. He has done too much."

"Is this about the disownment or the diary?"

Draco wanted to say neither; the answer was both. He stayed silent.

"He's still your father," said Bill. "He's still done right by you on more than one occasion, and I think that means he must care. Even if you aren't the reason he held back, it's okay to want to be. It's okay to open yourself up to the chance of getting hurt."

"That's absolutely ridiculous."

"I can see how it would sound ridiculous to you, but I think in the end, refusing to acknowledge your feelings is doing you more harm. Even though you might get hurt this time, you'd realize that more people care about you than you think. I'm not saying it's any substitute for a father, but in some cases, we can make our own family."

Draco looked down at Lukas in his arms and shrugged. Maybe.

He was up early the next day, rushing through breakfast because he really was falling behind on his work and there were lives that could be saved if he was able to pick up the trail of the Horocrux. Not to mention that Dumbledore still had to get back to him on his ideas for warding the Order headquarters against the Cloak of Merlin and he really had to check his investments if he wanted to stay in the public eye. He would have to make a killing this holiday season to keep his newfound power. He knew the other Purebloods would be doing everything they could to topple him.

He was so preoccupied with these thoughts that he hardly noticed when the dining room table began to fill. He finally jerked up when Ginny sat beside him, stifling a yawn but smiling in greeting. He pushed over his coffee mug and she took a sip and then answered his unspoken question.

"We're starting Christmas decorating today," she said. "Want to help?"

"Christmas decorating?" asked Draco.

"Yup. Garland and lights around the house, some mistletoe, maybe even finding a Christmas tree this afternoon."

Draco had never really put much thought into it, but he supposed that poorer families must put up their own decorations. Malfoy Manor was always decorated by the house elves, and having to put one's own time and energy into the task seemed liked a complete waste. It would just go down again in a week or so, besides, there was a war going on.

Draco excused himself from the decorating and went to his study, but he was frequently interrupted with requests to hold the Floo open so ornaments could be brought over from the Weasley house or help untangle a string of magical bulbs. He tried to teach them the charm, he really did, but they didn't really seem to be paying attention.

Each time he stepped out of his study, the chaos grew worse and worse. Garlands, real, live ones that shed needles all over the floors and not the expensive, charmed, self-hanging ones, were suspended from every wall. Light strands twisted around the boughs and lay in tangled heaps on the floor, ready to trip the unsuspecting. Ron, Hermione, and Harry were making paper chains of all things, with red and green and gold paper. Tiny, moving figures of St. Nicholas and elves were spread over every flat surface, and scented candles were lit, dispersing cinnamon and nutmeg odors into the already pine-scented halls. Charmed mistletoe whizzed from doorway to doorway, and Draco had to speed through entryways to avoid being caught under it.

It was a madhouse, full of laughter and music and directions to how to properly make paper snowflakes or hang a wreath. It was overwhelming and Draco was constantly invited to join in.

He was sick of the noise and attention, which made him curt, but part of him wanted to join in. He remembered Christmases in France with Lukas, when he watched the house elves put up the Christmas tree. He remembered shopping, and street carolers, and steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He remembered perfectly, but he also remembered the Christmases in England, with pristine decorations and a house full of dignitaries. He remembered waving good-bye to Lucius who was off to some party or other and being left alone with a tutor on Christmas Eve, and not seeing anyone else until New Years. He remembered, when he was older, sitting alone on the floor in front of the fireplace in the library with a stack of books and steadily working his way through them.

He remembered one Christmas like that, a particularly dismal holiday with grey skies and rain and being alone for five days. He read straight through Christmas, fell asleep right where he was Christmas night, and when he woke up the next morning, Lucius was sitting on the armchair across from him, returned early from the Minister's party.

Lucius had the house elves pack their bags and they left for a small Italian wizarding town. They spent three days there, Lucius only working mornings, and the rest of the time was divvied up however Draco pleased.

But Draco didn't like thinking of such things because it just reminded him how very far he was removed from his old life and how far he was separated from this new life as well. The thoughts were melancholic, and he really didn't need to be battling his emotions as well as working, so he simply made his distinct, bordering on rude, refusal at the invitations to help decorate and hid back in his study.

He was called out for lunch, which he attended, but not without reservations, for no sooner had he sat down, Ginny turned to him.

"We're going Christmas tree hunting this afternoon," she said. "You should come."

"To cut down a Christmas tree," said Draco.

"Of course you should come," said Harry, looking like a five year old, with his green eyes shining. He was practically vibrating with excitement.

Draco had to remind himself that the boy hero did spend most of his life in a cupboard and so making a snide comment would be inappropriately cruel. Merlin, he was turning into a Gryffindor, wasn't he?

The thought made him frown.

"No," he said.

"Oh, come on, Draco. Have a little fun. It's Christmas," said Ginny.

"I have to go into town this afternoon for business," said Draco. "Then I have more work to do."

"But Christmas is only once year."

"And it will come next year too."

"And will you actually take time to enjoy Christmas next year?"

Draco realized that the entire table seemed to be listening in on the conversation and he scowled. "It depends."

"Well aren't you the festive spirit," said Fred from the end of the table.

"Not a wet blanket at all," said George.

"By far, one who understands the true meaning of Christmas," said Fred.

"And warms our hearts with his joy," George finished.

Draco glared; Ginny laughed.

"Hermione, you know a good cheering charm, don't you?" asked Ron.

"Good idea, Ronnikins."

"Quite smart."

"I'd like to see you try," said Draco.

"That a challenge, Malfoy?" asked Fred, a gleam in his eyes.

"We could take you," said George.

Draco snorted. "Your attempts would be laughable."

"It would be a rather straight forward plan of attack," said Fred, and to Draco's askance, he actually pushed his plate away from him, eyeing the distance to Draco.

"How plebian," said Draco, wanting to avoid such a confrontation. Roughhousing was a concept he had only heard of and didn't wish to become personally familiar with the experience. "Fighting, at the dinner table."

"Yeah, well it's also the breakfast table," said George. "All holds are off."

"And that makes everything better," Draco snapped. He pushed himself to his feet. "If you will excuse me, I have business to attend, and wish to be off without engaging in hand to hand combat."

Ginny grabbed the back of his shirt when he tried to move away.

"Hey," she said, "what's wrong?"

Her eyes were concerned, head tilted to the side, confused. Draco was confused as well, not quite sure how the battle of wits had escalated, but he had never taken teasing well and he really was through with the holiday. He was also completely done with everyone pointing out how he couldn't seem to let go of the fact that they were at war.

"Nothing," he said shortly.

"Oh, sit down. Don't leave in a huff. Fred and George were only teasing, right?" She turned on the twins with a hard gaze, but they weren't to be tempered.

"Umm, not really, actually."

"Well, you have to admit, Gin-kins. He really could use a cheering charm."

Ginny turned to Draco. "You were being a little priggish."

Draco didn't take public criticism well, and maybe if she and he had been in private he could have accepted it, but they were in the dining room eating lunch and several of the adults looked exceedingly amused. His cheeks flushed a pale pink and he sneered.

"My sincerest apologies."

"Maybe he really could use that cheering charm," said Hermione, regarding him with a concerned expression, and Draco had to grind his teeth together to keep from cursing. When he did speak, it was coolly.

"Cheering charms only work on those who want to be cheered."

"So you admit you're resisting the cheer of the holiday to remain dank," said Ginny.

"No," said Draco. "I just seem to be the only one that remembers that this is no time for frivolities, and that our main attention should be on the war and not some tradition that has been exploited to benefit the economy. Now, I really must be gone as I have matters of the upmost importance to attend to, and by upmost, I mean the kind that could save your lives as I seem to be the only person who is thinking clearly at this moment."

And he stalked away, not bothering to Floo, but Apparating when he was a few feet from the table.

His business affairs took less time than he originally thought they would, so afterwards he saw to a few gifts that weren't exactly purchasable and then perused Knockturn Alley for a few things that he could use in hopes to ward the Order from the Cloak of Merlin. Dumbledore had yet to share his own methods of protecting the Order, but he was supposed to arrive at Grimmauld Place that evening.

In hopes to get more accomplished, Draco spent the rest of the afternoon at his flat working. He was largely distracted by his keyboard, but the afternoon was a productive one. He Flooed back in time for dinner, which meant that he arrived just as the Christmas Tree Expedition arrived with a tree that was most obviously not going to fit in the living room. It was far too tall, and quite fat, and was altogether a very healthy looking tree.

"Bloody hell," he swore, when the tree appeared in the hall, nearly toppling him as he made his way to his study.

"Oi, Malfoy," shouted one of the twins, Draco couldn't tell which as the tree branches obscured his vision. "Help us get it into the living room."

"It's not going to fit," said Draco.

"We were thinking that maybe you wouldn't mind expanding the ceiling," came Ginny's voice.

"This house is over a hundred years old," said Draco.

"Is that bad?"

"Architecture spells have been improved to allow for expansion without structural damage. Did you really need a tree this big?"

"It's Christmas," said Hermione. "We're allowed to be extravagant."

Draco sighed and then tried to peer around the tree, but there was no way he was getting by and there was no way the tree was getting through the door. He would have to Apparate it in and expand the ceiling there. It was already past lunch; this was going to take another chunk out of his schedule.

He got in another hour before dinner by the time the tree was set up, unfortunately dinner consisted of 'fingerfoods', so that the tree could be decorated during the evening meal.

Not only had Draco never decorated a tree before, it seemed every ornament had sentimental value to which the Weasley's exclaimed over and shared stories before floating it up on tree. They weren't exclusive about the memories, in fact, Sirius, Harry, and Hermione fit right in, asking questions and occasionally chiming in their own stories, although Harry had none to share, and the three didn't appear to be intruding in on a family Christmas at all.

Draco, however, was out of his element. He could have made an effort to be included, but he was overwhelmed, exhausted, and in no mood to muster any Christmas cheer. The radio was switched on soon, Christmas music pouring out, and the family actually began to sing, and with harmonies and descants as well. Draco was astounded. He had no idea people actually sang around the Christmas tree; it was story-book cliché and antiquated and oddly charming.

"Come hang some ornaments," said Ginny, motioning him over to the tree. Draco gazed at the sea of boxes and spelled paper to prevent any broken ornaments and then at the tree which was being spread liberally and randomly with porcelain angels and snowmen. He shook his head.

"Please?" said Ginny.

"I set the bloody thing up," said Draco.

"But you haven't hung an ornament."

"I'll live."

"Are you just going to sit there then?"

"No," said Draco, "I have to finish my work."

"You've been working all day. Take some time off."

"It's important."

"So is this."

"No, it's really not," said Draco, before he could temper what he was going to say.

Ginny frowned; Draco sighed and ran a hand through his hair.

"It's a tree," he said, trying to explain.

"A Christmas tree," said Ginny.

"Right, and this whole Christmas thing is all well and good, it's just…it takes a lot of time."

"Time spent with family and friends."

"And that time can't be spent with family and friends if this war is lost."

"And you're not going to end the war this evening."

"It would greatly help."

Ginny gave him an unconvinced look.

"It's just that, you're only going to have to take it all down again," said Draco.

"Well, yeah," said Ginny.

"So it hardly seems worth the hassle, is all," said Draco.

Silence met his words and he realized that the radio was turned low, the room watching the two, staring at Draco. The festive mood was broken. Draco swore underneath his breath and stood.

"I've got things to do," he said, and quickly exited the room. He didn't stop until he reached his study and shut the door behind him, leaning against the wood and swearing again.

He was at a loss on what to do. He knew that he wasn't thinking before he spoke, knew that there were several things he could be doing that might actually improve his standing in the Order. He could simply hang a few ornaments for one, and then beg off. He could have made a few comments about the size of the tree instead of glowering about being pulled away from his projects. Really, he could have done a lot, but he couldn't help shake the feeling that nothing he did would ever be enough, that he wouldn't quite close that separation. Maybe looking in is the farthest he would ever get.

Draco dismissed the thoughts again, never one to dwell in his emotions more than necessary. He turned back to his projects, not emerging from his study until his shoulders ached from leaning over the desk and his eyelids stayed closed longer than they stayed open. It wasn't very late at night, but Draco decided it was time for bed anyway. He could always get up early.

He closed his books and opened the door. Immediately the sounds of voices became clear, the silencing charms on the room keeping all the noise out. He started down the hall, his footsteps silent as he'd pulled off his boots in his study and was now walking in sock feet. He had yet to turn the corner into the room when he realized they were talking about him. He stopped short and listened.

"He hasn't smiled, the entire time he's been here, Albus," Mrs. Weasley was saying in a low voice. So Dumbledore was finally here.

"Mum, I've seen him smile once or twice since I've known him. He's just not emotionally expressive." That was Bill.

"But Molly has a point," said Mr. Weasley. "He's been particularly difficult these past few days."

"He's just concerned," said Bill. "He's very logical and he doesn't understand things which aren't based on scientific truths."

"But he's a genius," said Lupin.

"Who has had limited experience with interpersonal relationships," said Bill.

"But every child understands Christmas," countered Lupin.

"Maybe he's not just used to our type," said Mrs. Weasley. "You should have seen the look he gave to the garland. Granted it's a little crooked and sheds needles, but he looked at it like it was poison."

"He's probably just used to the charmed decorations, and used to the house elves doing the work," said Mr. Weasley.

"And he didn't know about paper snowflakes, nothing at all."

"Like the Malfoy home would have paper snowflakes?" asked Sirius. "Aristocratic families celebrate in style. Fake, magicked trees with real gold and silver ornaments, the best food there is on the finest china with crystal goblets. The children receive a roomful of gifts each and bitch when they don't get the right color toy. Believe me, I did for a little while."

"So that's it then?" asked Mrs. Weasley. "He's just used to extravagance?"

"That's not it," said Bill, sounding rather testy.

"Has he talked to you?" asked Lupin.

There was a pause. Draco remembered telling Bill, the first year they met, how his mother liked to go off visiting other men and how his father was usually gone. He remembered telling Bill that he bought his own presents and was reimbursed at a later time. His fingers flew through their pattern; he hoped Bill wouldn't say anything.

"I just don't think he's used to a big deal being made out of the holiday, that's all."

Draco slowed his fingers down to a steady pace, grateful to the other man, but Bill usually did know when confidences were given.

"Then he should be excited about a party instead of sulking about the house," said Mrs. Weasley.

"It is a bit disconcerting," said Sirius.

"Like this evening, when we were singing carols. Albus, he stood there, looking exactly like Lucius Malfoy, and refusing to join in or hang ornaments, and he just left the room."

"How bad was the singing?" Dumbledore asked, finally speaking up, and Sirius burst into laughter.

"Maybe he didn't know any carols," said Bill quietly.

"It's not possible to get through Christmas without singing carols, or hearing them at a party," said Mrs. Weasley. "And even if he didn't, he's decidedly unapproachable and bitter. And when the kids invited him to go Christmas tree hunting, he nearly started a fight with Fred and George."

"Mum, Fred and George nearly started the fight," said Charlie.

"But it takes two sides to have a fight."

"And then, when we were hanging ornaments and Ginny asked him to help. Do you remember what he said?"

"Mum, I don't think he really meant it," said Charlie.

"He might have meant it," said Bill, "but he wasn't raised with such a to do about it all."

"What did he say?" asked Lupin.

"That it hardly seemed Christmas was worth such hassle," said Mrs. Weasley. "And earlier he said it was just an old tradition exploited for the business to make a profit."

"We've our own little Scrooge, wouldn't you say, Albus?" asked Sirius.

Draco turned on his heel and went back to his study before he heard the answer.

Bill frowned as Draco left the room. He knew that the holiday was causing some tension between Draco and the rest of the house, but he assumed that it would pass. Draco usually didn't let such things bother him, but then again, the boy had been pressed to join in every single holiday activity, and not always in a nice way. Bill sighed. He would have to chat with his family. Maybe if they laid off him for a bit he would feel more welcome, or at least less irritated.

He forgot how long it took to hang the Christmas ornaments. Most of them were old, dating back to the childhood years when they would make decorations out of clay or tin foil. Some were

antique, ones that their grandparents had passed on, made of porcelain and hand painted by wizarding artists. There was a story for each one.

Harry ate up the stories. This was his second family Christmas, his first with Sirius. It was heart wrenching to think of what his other Christmases must have been like to make such simple things like hanging ornaments such a pleasure.

Bill had thought that Draco was a lot like Harry, not a lot of Christmas memories and he wondered why Harry was so keen to make them and why Draco seemed so intent on not making any. He figured it out when a French Christmas carol played over the radio.

Harry hadn't had any happy memories of a Christmas. Draco did, before his half-brother had died. Maybe he even had a few good memories with Lucius after the move to England. Whatever they were, his traditions would have been vastly different from the celebrations now. Draco had never done well with integrating his past with his present because he had changed so much. No doubt he felt very much out of place here, unable to decide if he should try to join in or merely watch.

Bill would need to talk with Draco. Not tonight, not when things were already strained. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe he could also convince Draco to take some time off, not a full day, but the kid needed to have a breather. That decided, he settled back, flicking his wand and sending a snowman ornament up to the top of the tree which had several bare patches where branches were showing. It wouldn't be a Weasley Christmas tree until it was completely covered with ornaments of every color, shape, and size.

It was late by the time the tree was finished. The kids went to bed, planning on shopping in the morning, and the adults retired to the dining room table. Albus had yet to arrive and so they brewed a pot of tea while they waited. The Headmaster stepped out of the Floo fifteen minutes later.

"My apologies," he said. "I got hung up with a bit of business with the school board. Seems Hogwarts might be opening back up a little late this year."

He sat down at the table and Molly got him a cup of tea.

"I, of course, expect the students to be devastated." His blue eyes twinkled and Bill smiled. "Speaking of students," Dumbledore continued, "is Draco still up? I have a few things to run by him."

Some of the table exchanged looks.

"It can wait until tomorrow," said Dumbledore. "I just thought he might still be awake."

"He is," said Bill. "He's in his study."

"He's been there all day," said Sirius, "or close to it."

Dumbledore smiled. "Yes. I had never thought him as a Christmas lover, too much good will and cheer around. Severus detests the holiday as well. He's been hiding out in his dungeons. Perhaps I should send him over someday; he can keep Draco company."

"But it's not just the holiday," said Molly. "He hasn't smiled, the entire time he's been here, Albus."

"Mum, I've seen him smile once or twice since I've known him. He's just not emotionally expressive," said Bill in Draco's defense.

"But Molly has a point," said Arthur. "He's been particularly difficult these past few days."

Bill tried to explain, but once started, his mother ranted until she was finished, and Lupin and his father chimed in as well. The two weren't condemning Draco, but they didn't understand why the blond had been so distant and cool. It seemed that previous prejudices were coming into play as well. Bill turned to Dumbledore, hoping that the old wizard understood that there was a lot more going on with Draco than simple hatred of the holiday. Dumbledore met his gaze and twinkled.

"How bad was the singing?" the Headmaster asked, countering a complaint. Sirius laughed and Bill shot a glance at his mother.

"Maybe he didn't know any carols."

"It's not possible to get through Christmas without singing carols, or hearing them at a party," said Mrs. Weasley. "And even if he didn't, he's decidedly unapproachable and bitter. And when the kids invited him to go Christmas tree hunting, he nearly started a fight with Fred and George."

"Mum, Fred and George nearly started the fight," said Charlie.

"But it takes two sides to have a fight."

"And then, when we were hanging ornaments and Ginny asked him to help. Do you remember what he said?"

"Mum, I don't think he really meant it," said Charlie.

"He might have meant it," said Bill, "but he wasn't raised with such a to do about it all."

"What did he say?" asked Lupin.

"That it hardly seemed Christmas was worth such hassle," said Mrs. Weasley. "And earlier he said it was just an old tradition exploited for the business to make a profit."

"We've our own little Scrooge, wouldn't you say, Albus?" asked Sirius.

Bill shook his head. "That's unfair-," he started, but Dumbledore spoke over him.

"And by the end of the book, Ebenezer changed when the ghosts of Christmas showed him how to celebrate the holiday, and he eventually reflected the love that was directed towards him by others."

The Headmaster raised his eyebrows, effectively silencing the table. Bill nodded his thanks to Dumbledore and sat back in his chair. Maybe now things could start running smoother.

Hi, again, sorry I wasn't able to respond to reviews, but I will make a herculean effort to do so this week. Until Tuesday then!





18. Cloaks and More Chaos

Disclaimer: Umm, not mine. Sad, innit?

Author's note: So, this is a bit late, sorry. I didn't get to really edit it, because I figured I should get it up when promised. I'll take a look over it sometime this week. And speaking of this week, I won't be updating as I'll be out of town for a bit. So, it'll be a two week wait until the first of July. Hope you enjoy the chapter.

Draco was enveloped in his work the next morning when Bill came in. He looked up, quirking an eyebrow at the new father.

"Hey," said Bill.

There was something in his tone of voice, a hesitance that made Draco narrow his gaze.

"What?" he asked.

"What what?" asked Bill. "Can't I just stop in to say hi? See how you're doing?"

"You had a tone," said Draco.

"Alright," said Bill, holding his hands up. "I have another reason for stopping in."

Draco waited, but now that Bill admitted he had an ulterior motive, he seemed loathed to elaborate. Bill took a breath.

"How are you?" he asked. "You seem a little…distant lately. You okay?"

"Yeah," said Draco. "Fine." He didn't mention that he was still smarting over the remarks he had overheard last night, and that because of those remarks, he felt an urge to be even more contrary. No one could ever say he hadn't been a difficult child, Bill didn't need to know that he had been listening.

"We might be going a little crazy with Christmas this year," said Bill, "but that's us just trying to keep some level of normality. It's been a rather hard year and this is our way of celebrating the fact that our family is still intact, or as intact as it can be with Percy away."

Now that Draco thought back, it had been a busy year for the red-haired family. Bill had been playing spy and nearly killed that past spring. Dumbledore had mentioned a few attacks during the summer. Ron had been kidnapped and a step away from death's door in the fall. Bill got married and Fleur nearly miscarried. Their daughter was dating a Malfoy…In a way, Draco could understand the need for an outlet of all that tension, so he nodded.

"What's normal for you?" asked Bill.

"What?" asked Draco, startled out of his thoughts.

"What do you normally do on Christmas? Is there any way we can make the holiday better for you?"

Draco shook his head. "You know I don't really celebrate the holiday."

"You said Lucius never really celebrated it. There must be something you usually do, some sort of tradition, anything at all."

Draco shrugged a shoulder. "I read," he said.

"You read," said Bill.

"Yeah. I take the day off and read a bit, that's it, so don't feel like you have to do anything special to make me feel comfortable."

"But you spend Christmas reading books, and here we are making a fuss and a half about it. How's that making you comfortable?"

Draco didn't answer. Bill let out a breath.

"Are you completely out of place here? Did I ask too much when I wanted you to stay?"

Draco heard the note of self-incrimination in Bill's voice. He also heard the regret and he knew that the red-haired man was wishing Draco had been born into a different family.

"Bill, it's fine. It's…you're all loud and busy and…just a lot to take in, but it's not…it's not bad, or horrible. If I was any other teenager, I'd no doubt be having the time of my life."

"But you're not just any other teenager," said Bill. "You're Draco Malfoy, genius extraordinaire."

Draco's lips quirked at that, but then the door opened and Hermione popped her head in.

"Hey, Dra-, oh, am I interrupting?"

"No," said Draco, because continuing the conversation would just mean Bill would continue to feel guilty and Draco didn't know how else to reassure him. He didn't know how to tell Bill it was alright because honestly he didn't know if it was.

"Oh good," Hermione said, "because Harry, Ron, and I are going Christmas shopping."

"Good for you?" Draco asked, not quite sure how this pertained to him.

"Come with us," said Hermione.

Draco shook his head. "Absolutely not."

"Oh, come on. When else are you going to go?"

"Later," said Draco.

"Christmas is six days away. Do you even have gifts yet?"

"Yes," said Draco.

"Do you still need some more?"

Draco wanted to lie, just so that she would stop hassling him, but he wasn't exactly sure on the whole etiquette of gift-giving. In high-society, everyone gave gifts to those in the house, related, friends or enemies, and the gifts were always expensive and rare. Now, however, he was living with those who were quite decidedly middle-class, and who were all part of an odd, but loving family. He didn't know who he was expected to get gifts for, how expensive those gifts should be, or how much thought he should put into them.

He hesitated, so Hermione naturally took his silence for confirmation of his attending the trip.

"Brilliant!" she said, happily. "Get your shoes; we're leaving in five."

She ran off and Draco turned to Bill. "See," he said. "Everything's fine. I'm even going Christmas shopping with the Golden Trio."

"Then why do you look like your being led to your execution?" asked Bill.

"Because I'm sure Hermione is acquainted with the saying 'Shop 'til You Drop'," said Draco. It was a saying that was found in both the Muggle and magical communities, because witch or not, all teenaged girls were the same.

Hermione did seem to be well aware of that saying. Upon arrival Harry and Ron had immediately suggested they split up, as Hermione and Harry needed to shop for each other, and the two Gryffindor boys had left Draco and Hermione quite eagerly. Well, Ron did at least, Harry only left when he was positive that Draco was going to look out for Hermione, and then he seemed quite relieved to kiss his girlfriend good-bye.

Draco soon realized that the two Gryffindors must have encouraged his presence for this very reason. Hermione had visited half of Diagon Alley in an hour's time and showed no signs of tiring. Draco was dragged along, boredom and tedium setting in far too quickly.

"So why are you staying with the Weasleys?" he asked while she perused a shelf in a popular bookstore. The question had been bothering him for a while and he was eager for any conversation. He then glared at the customers who never seemed to tire of walking by their aisle,

heads craned to get a better look at the two of them. He didn't know who they were more excited about seeing, the girlfriend of Harry Potter or the deposed Malfoy.

"Partly for Harry, and partly because my parents already had to move twice because of threatening letters or such. They've been hooked up to the Muggle Protection Service, with wards and scheduled check-ins, but because I'm the main cause of the threats, it's not prudent to spend too much time at home. I'm safer with the Order and they're safer if I'm away."

"Makes sense," said Draco, and then was struck by the thought that his comment sounded rather callous. He was overly aware of his actions because of the overheard comments from the night before, so he spoke again. "Sounds rough."

"Yeah, it is," she said. "But the Weasleys are great and I've got Harry, so it's alright."

Draco made a face at her optimism and glared as another troupe of customers crawled by, staring at them and whispering together.

"Next time, we use an identity charm," he bit off to Hermione.

"I thought you enjoyed all of the attention," she said.

"There's a time and place," he said, leaning against the opposite bookshelf. He stuffed his hands in his coat pockets, his left hand brushing his wand, clasping it lightly. He didn't like waiting here in the middle of an aisle with people peering in from both ends. It was exposed.

"Relax, Draco," said Hermione. "I can feel your paranoia."

"What are you even getting here?" he asked.

"Something for Ginny," said Hermione. She turned around. "What are you getting her?"

"Nothing yet."

"Nothing?"

"I've a few ideas."

"Such as?"

Draco shrugged. "I'd rather worry about everyone else first. Who, exactly, do you buy presents for in the Order?"

"Harry, Ron, Ginny, and usually something generic for the rest. Last year I got Mr. and Mrs. Weasley a small tea set, just for the two of them, and coffee mugs for the rest of the Weasley boys, nothing big." She gave him a measured look. "You want to go in with me?" she asked.

"In with you?"

"Well, Harry views them all like his real family, so they do the 'family gift-giving' which involves larger and more personal gifts, so I'm really the only one that isn't strictly related, but now you are too, so let's go in together."

Draco shrugged. "Any ideas?"

She grinned. "A few, yeah. Come on." She put the book back on the shelf and started out of the store. Draco dutifully followed, still sweeping the passerbys and gawkers with a cool gaze.

They ended up getting the rest of the Order little magical desktop kit; a tiny two person game of Quidditch for Charlie, with miniscule brooms in a glass ball; a tiny waterfall, with the water charmed to flow back up to the top, for Mr. Weasley, and so on.

Hermione then accompanied him to pick up presents to ship to Sam and Laney, and he followed her to get gifts for her own family.

"You didn't get me anything, did you?" he asked, helping her carrying items to the register.

"Yes."

"What did you get?"

"I'm not just going to tell you," said Hermione, scandalized at the thought.

He rolled his eyes. "Well, how am I going to know what to get you?"

"What would you get a friend normally?"

Draco cast a side-long look at her. "Do you want a pair of diamond earrings, Granger? Because I can get them for you."

She blinked at him. "You got just normal friends diamond earrings?"

"We were really more acquaintances."

Hermione shook her head. "I don't know if I could live like you, Draco."

"It's an acquired taste," he said.

They left the store and then crossed the road, window shopping on the other side. Draco checked the reflection in the glass as often as he checked the merchandise. It was his 'paranoia' as Hermione put it, that alerted him to the presence of the elder and junior Notts approaching from the end of the street.

Draco turned, watching the two come closer, not spotting them yet, but still forcing their way through if people didn't step aside quick enough. He could tell by their expressions that now would not be a good time to meet.

"Granger, let's go," he said.

"What?"

"It's time to go." He pushed himself off the building and put a hand on her elbow, steering her away.

"Why?" she asked, taking a step to follow him because his voice was cool and set, but the crowd thinned and a harsh greeting was called out.

"Oi, Malfoy. You banging the Mudblood now?"

Draco turned to face the two, pushing Hermione gently to the side, angled behind him.

"Theodore and Theodore," he said. "What a pleasure to see you two gentlemen out and about. The house arrest was lifted then, and just in time for the holidays. How fortunate."

Theodore Nott Jr. was a tall boy, taller than Draco by a few inches, but nearly twice as heavy and while some of that was fat, most of it was muscle. Theodore Nott Sr. was even bigger. Still, Draco knew he could best them both in a duel, but that didn't mean he would do so effortlessly. Especially not in this setting when Draco would have to look out for Hermione and the rest of the shoppers.

"I hear that you were disowned, Draco."

Draco raised an eyebrow, waiting for the rest of the insult, but Theodore seemed to think that the mere emphasis on his first name was enough. He shrugged a shoulder.

"Lucius and I view the world differently. He sees profit in the complete overhaul of society while I think only a few minor adjustments are necessary."

"Minor adjustments? Like dating a Mudblood, you mean?"

"No, Miss Granger and I are not dating. I'm merely accompanying her to buy a few gifts."

He said nothing more, not inviting a fight, but not running from one either.

The elder Nott stared down at him.

"I always knew Lucius was too lenient with you, with you and his scarlet woman. If he had any sense, he would have stamped on your wandering ways while you were still young. If the spirit is rebellious, then it must be broken."

"You'll forgive me for not listen to your parenting advice. I see no reason to think your own advice in worthy of remembering," said Draco, his glance straying to the younger Nott and back to the father with a scornful curl of his lip.

"And to think that Lucius would dare compare your accomplishments to our own faithful children. He asserted us that you were far more intelligent, far more powerful. Now his words are proven to be lies."

Draco raised an eyebrow. "I don't see why that would be true. So far I've defied the Dark Lord twice, have foiled his plans and bested all of you. Tell me the falsehood."

"An intelligent child would follow his father's path and would not have denied his lord."

Draco shook his head. "He is not my lord, nor will he ever be."

"Because now you serve that fool Dumbledore."

"I serve no one but myself. Tell me, Nott, do you think Slytherin would bow to another?"

"Slytherin bows to no-one, but he deserves for us to bow to him."

"Slytherin only ever respected Gryffindor for not bowing to him. Would you rather eat crumbs from your master's table, or sit at his right hand?"

"The Dark Lord is Slytherin, but more powerful, more dangerous, more committed to the Pureblood ideals."

"Your master is a Half-blood and Slytherin is turning in his grave."

"You blaspheme the Dark Lord!"

"Yes, I did. What is he really going to do about it?"

"He need not lift a finger. His loyal servants will strike you down."

And Nott went for his wand, Hermione grabbed Draco's arm, and Draco simply raised his eyebrows.

"And cast a curse in public, with all of these witnesses? You can do nothing, Nott, and any threat you may give is empty and vain."

Draco waited as Nott floundered, casting about for something to say, something to do that would assert the power of his lord, but nothing came. He smirked.

"Have a good day, Theodore and Theodore. Happy Christmas."

Draco deliberately turned his back on them, confidant they would not strike. Hermione glanced back as they walked away, still holding onto Draco's arm.

"What were you thinking?" she demanded, once they were sufficiently passed the two to be out of earshot.

"Pardon?"

"You were deliberately winding them up! They could have started cursing."

"Nott's been around too much to be that stupid, and Theodore wouldn't do a thing without his father's approval." Draco looked over at her, still smirking. "Tell me that wasn't fun."

"One of these days you're going to get hit. I just hope I'm around to see it," Hermione said. She looked ahead, ignoring him, but finally relented. "Alright, maybe it was a little bit fun."

"We'll make you a Slytherin yet, Granger."

"Not if you become a Gryffindor first."

They met up with Ron and Harry, and Draco immediately dumped the bags on Potter with a glare. Ron laughed; Harry grinned sheepishly and they Apparated back, just in time for a late lunch.

Dumbledore was at the table, obviously waiting for their arrival.

"Hello, Draco," said Dumbledore. "I thought we might discuss the cloak after lunch if you had some free time, since we didn't get to last night."

"Yeah, sure," said Draco, and he rushed through his meal, despite the Headmaster's protests that he take his time, and they retired to the study.

"I've been collecting information on the houses broken into so far," said Dumbledore, putting a parchment down on the desk Draco hastily cleared. "It's a very thorough search for the Headquarters, and while we are under the Fidelis charm, we won't be protected if they find the location of the Black's house on their own."

"And while the site changes, that doesn't mean they can't find it some other way," Draco finished.

"Exactly."

Draco scanned over the list. It wasn't particularly large, but it was apparent that much thought was being put into the sites located and infiltrated.

"Is this the complete list?"

"That we can tell. There are some homes so old that it's impossible to account for any break-ins, but we've done a thorough analysis of any magical residue."

"What ideas do you have to detect the cloak if is used to enter the Headquarters?"

As it turned out, Dumbledore had quite a few and Draco reviewed them, searching for the best solution. They were hindered by the fact that the exact make-up of the cloak was not known. The material had been kept on display, kept as an artifact and not thoroughly studied. There was also the problem of what to do with the Death Eater if they did manage to catch the spy. If the spy didn't return from his mission, it would be obvious where the Order was meeting.

Draco fell silent after it became apparent that many of their options were truly based on guesswork. There was a good chance that with both Draco and Dumbledore's agreement on the spells of the cloak that their countermeasures would work, but without one hundred percent certainty – Draco would put the real probability at seventy-five percent – it would be dangerous to stay where they were.

"I am sorry that I was not able to come yesterday," said Dumbledore, pulling Draco out of his thoughts.

Draco shrugged. "It's fine."

"No questions to my whereabouts?"

"If you're busy, you're busy."

"Or you already heard my excuse when I came last night," said Dumbledore.

Draco looked up and raised an eyebrow.

"How much did you hear?" asked the Headmaster.

"How would you know if I heard anything?"

"You seemed far too distant at lunch to merely be annoyed at the holiday. Eavesdroppers rarely do hear anything they would like to hear, but you should know, they are more worried and confused than they are annoyed by your attitude."

Draco scoffed at that, but then brushed away the words. "It doesn't matter."

"Of course it matters. Miscommunication can lead to isolation, and I think that it is time you had a real family for support."

Draco's eyes flashed, but he kept his voice cool. "I would ask you not to draw conclusions as you see them. In this matter your lack of knowledge betrays you."

Dumbledore held up placating hands. "I mean no offense, but I mean what I have said. You've made large steps in forging bonds, but Sam and Laney are far away. And while Bill is a wonderful mentor, and Ginny is a sweet girl, but both of them are high target profiles."

Draco narrowed his eyes. "What are you saying?"

"What you already know. What are the odds of both of them surviving if full-scale war should break out now?"

"I'm not in the mood for speculation," said Draco.

"But you need to hear it," Dumbledore countered. "And even if they do survive, what then? Will you be dependent on two people alone?"

"I'm not dependent on anyone!"

"But you are dependent, emotionally so, and you aren't exactly well-adjusted or an easy soul to care for. Will you rely solely on them?"

"What's your point?" asked Draco. "Should I enroll in a pen-pal program? Should I enroll the entire Order in team-building activities for my own benefit?"

"No, but you could put less effort in distancing yourself from the rest of the family. It's hard to keep so aloof in a house full of Weasleys; harder than it is to simply participate and I think you know that. Let yourself get pulled in on the excitement every now and then. The rest will follow."

Draco glared and didn't answer. He picked up the schematics of the wards they were considering and scanned the page, not wanting to debate the Headmaster because the argument was distasteful, but he was unable to let the old man have the last word. He looked up.

"Next time, save the therapy session for when I ask for it."

"Take my advice and I shouldn't need to stage an intervention."

Dumbledore's voice was kind, but firm. Draco looked back to the page and tilted his head, his fingers finding a steady beat to tap out their pattern.

"You have another idea," said Dumbledore.

"It's a bit risky," said Draco. "But the results might be worth it."

"How so?" asked Dumbledore.

"Well, for one, this should take place relatively soon, meaning that we wouldn't have to worry about when the invasion would take place for the next few weeks. That would leave us free to spread goodwill and Christmas cheer for the holiday."

His tone might have been dripping with derision towards the end because Dumbledore looked at him with something akin to pity in his eyes.

"If ever there was a need for Christmas spirits," he said, shaking his head.

Draco gave an unrepentant smirk.

"Christmas," said Dumbledore, "has never been as important as it is now."

"Christmas is invading my work space," said Draco. "There's a war going on. Getting this done can save lives."

"But it won't save every life, Draco. Holidays are for us to gather happy memories that we can reflect upon when life takes a difficult turn, and it will get difficult, especially with our current struggles. If we don't take the time now to treasure our loved ones, when will we? There will always be threats and danger, but never enough time with one another. This break does not mean we are forgetting the war, we are just taking the time to rest and remember what it is we are fighting for."

"Yeah, fine," said Draco, brushing the speech away. "So are you interested or not?"

He thought, four hours later, that he must have miscalculated because he hadn't been expecting results until tomorrow. They had warned the rest of the family, but because he hadn't been expecting it, the family hadn't either. His only consolation was that Dumbledore agreed with his assessment, so while he was wrong, the Headmaster was wrong as well.

It was a bit after dinner, but they were all still in the dining room to make Christmas cookies. Draco wasn't going to stay, but Dumbledore had given him a pointed look and, whether he admitted it or not, Dumbledore did have a point with his clichéd speech in the study. Besides, it wasn't every day Draco found people willing to put up with him, and while he complained bitterly about the noise and chaos, it was a good feeling knowing that there were people who would look out for him.

So Draco helped roll out dough and then learned the proper spells for punching out tree or snowman shaped holes from Mrs. Weasley. After the cookies had baked, the shapes had the opportunity to be iced with different colored frostings or other various decorations. Draco had never iced or decorated a cake, much less a cookie, but it wasn't too difficult and, dare he say it, somewhat entertaining, mostly because of the antics of Fred and George.

"Always so correct, Draco," said Bill, watching how he mixed small amounts of frosting together to make a deep brown for the tree trunk. "You could just make it blue, you know."

Draco frowned. "Tree bark isn't blue."

"I know," said Bill, "but you could even make it a red tree with a yellow trunk if you wanted. Think of it like a coloring page when you were little."

Draco gave Bill a look; Bill shook his head.

"Don't tell me. You always used the correct colors. If I found your four year old pictures, there wouldn't be any color outside the lines and everything would be perfectly, and correctly, shaded."

"Naturally," said Draco, putting his normal green tree cookie on the platter with pink and purple trees and orange snowmen. A bit of green icing got onto his finger and he looked at it in consternation before scanning the table for a towel.

Bill sighed. "Just lick it off, Draco."

Lick it off? Draco hadn't licked his fingers since he was three. Still, it seemed to be the thing to do here, so Draco cautiously brought his finger to his mouth and licked away the frosting. It was startlingly sweet but creamy and smooth. Bill laughed at him and moved away to rescue Fleur from Lukas, who was liberally smeared with blue icing. Fleur had tried to direct his hands in decorating a cookie.

It was then that several loud, consecutive whistles blared and Draco jumped to his feet, wand out in an instant. Dumbledore whirled as well, shouting "Get down!" to the table.

The room filled with a light fog. While the Cloak of Merlin was undetectable when entering a fortress, if the person wearing the cloak was inadvertently sent to another location due to a Portkey, the activation of the Portkey could be set to an alarm.

Like he and Dumbledore expected, the cloak had invisibility charms set in it as well, nothing as good as Potter's of course, but nearly perfect. The light fog allowed them to make out the shape of the spy.

Spells were instantly cast, bright and sparkling and blasting the walls and tables. Draco came to several conclusions in those first nano-seconds. One, the Death Eaters had visited the old home of Andromeda Tonks, looking for the Order's whereabouts, much sooner than he had expected.

Two, there were far more of them then there should have been. He had been expecting two huddled under the Cloak of Merlin, but somehow the cloak had been duplicated. There were at least five empty spaces moving along in the fog.

Three, the disorienting Portkey that Dumbledore and Draco had set up to bring the unsuspecting Death Eaters to the actual Order headquarters was doing a wonderful job. The Portkey had been of a dark variety, which made for a bumpy ride, spewing the invisible spies out with no regard

for their safety and the spells that the Death Eaters were casting were going wide and missing the Order members.

Four, the additional wards on the house were doing an excellent job in blocking the more dangerous curses. Dumbledore and Draco had set up a Dark Magic dampening field which severely inhibited the more harmful curses. The Order had been informed of the field and were only using the lighter spells, wingardium leviosa, stupefy, etc, so their own curses were not affected.

Five, there was one Death Eater who was oddly protected from the dampening field, and not only that, but the Death Eater noticed the fog and was countering it, sweeping the cloud aside, making it harder to find the Death Eaters.

Most of the Order had retreated behind a knocked over table, hiding Fleur, Lukas, and Mrs. Weasley from the attack. Bill, Mr. Weasley, and Charlie had formed a protective shield in front of the table while the rest battled the cloaked spies. In the first few moments, the Order was clearly winning, but then the leader, it must be the leader, began clearing the smoke away and casting dark curses, completely unimpeded by the field.

One curse struck Lupin, felling the werewolf, and the now harder-to-see targets were able to take the offense. Fred and George responded by forgoing their wands in favor of the frosting bowls. The cloaks were impervious to the tracking charms and revealing spells, but they were unable to hide splatters of confectionary sugar, butter, milk, and food coloring. The icing stuck to their robes and funny blue, green, red, and yellow spots floated in the air before being toppled by stupefies.

Draco dispatched one more and then looked to where Dumbledore was battling the leader, marked by a blue stain on what must be the right arm of the cloak. Dumbledore was more than holding his own, even against the dark curses, but then a splotch of green got off a lucky shot, hitting the overturned table and splintering the wood. Fleur screamed and the blue-stained leader furthered the assault by lashing out with a fire-starting curse, specifically dark and hard to counter. The back of the room flared up.

Dumbledore glanced over, locked eyes with Draco, and the two flash-stepped in unison, Dumbledore appearing by the table, countering the dark curse with a plethora of lighter charms. Draco had been unaware of such counters, as he was versed mostly in the darker spells, and he appeared where Dumbledore had been moments before, ready to duel the Death Eater.

Draco tuned out the sounds around him, ignoring the instant pang of panic for his godson and ignoring the desire to search for Ginny. Last he had seen she was battling with the Golden Trio, and he trusted Harry to keep an eye out for her. He blocked the onslaught of curses from the spy leader, and then caught the Death Eater off guard by lunging forward.

He crashed into the Death Eater and they both hurled backwards, into the hall, Draco landing hard on the Death Eater. He was shoved away, but grabbed the cloak and rolled, looking over to see none other than Claire Jameson revealed.

"Surprise," she said, grinning with cruel intent. The spell she called down next would have ground most of his bones into fine powder, but he rolled just in time and called up the strongest shield he could muster. Her next curse hit the shield, but at the moment of impact, he thrust outwards, bouncing the spell off and back at her.

Claire jumped back into the living room and Draco ran after her. He had the disadvantage, unable to use any dark spells to block and respond to hers. Still, he forced her back with a quick combination, trying to get her against the wall.

Claire was a formidable opponent though, highly intelligent in her own right, and she threw a few offensive curses while defending herself, dark curses calling on fire. Without thinking, he automatically threw up a Fendlers ward, the best defense against such spells, but the ward had its roots in dark magic, and the dampening field on the house restricted the ward.

The spell hit the weakened ward and while he was protected from the main effects – he didn't burst into flame – the force tossed him backwards. He was flung into the back wall and slid to the floor. He scrambled to his feet, managing to block her next two curses and sending out his own, but the impact had dazed him. Her next curse slipped through and there was a deafening pop in both of his ears. He was on the floor before he even registered the pain, but then it was there, fire, shooting through his ears and brain and the slightest movement caused the world to twist and roll.

He knew what spell it was; he'd used it many times before. It blew out the eardrums and canals of the victim, causing a loss of balance, extreme pain, and a searing tinnitus. Right now the note being shrieked in his ears was a high B flat.

His wand was lying a few feet away, but he couldn't even lift his head to find Claire. The room was spinning as the fluid in his inner ears finally settled, but so much as breathing was enough to send the fluid sloshing through the torn canals.

Claire stalked forward, her shoes hitting the ground and creating vibrations that caused the room to jump before his eyes.

"Well, this is familiar," she said. "You, at my mercy. Very clever, by the way, sending us right to you. I don't suppose you want to tell me where we are, do you?"

"Not particularly," Draco managed, watching her step forward until she was right beside him, the sparkling Christmas tree behind her an odd foil to her deadly expression.

"So sad," she said, and leveled her wand at him.

Draco jerked forward, closing his eyes against the crazed movements of the room, forcing his limbs to ignore the wild bucking of the ground. His hand closed in on his wand. He didn't have to see her to cast the spell that brought down the ceiling to its original height, toppling the tree. The infragilis charm was a split second after thought.

He knew he was headed for the wall, and so his outstretched hand hit it first. He sagged gratefully against it before turning around and risking a look. The room was heaving this way and that, but he could make out the gold blob underneath the pine tree. He slid to the floor, wand pointed as the blonde head started to stir.

"Don't even think about it," he said.

She didn't, but she did Portkey away, and then people were running into the room.

"Draco!"

He could just make out the word, garbled and low, and his ears burned with pain. Bill came into view, face panicked. Draco knew his ears were bleeding and that it probably looked a whole lot worse than it was.

"I'm fine," he said, wincing at the volume of his own voice and hoping he hadn't yelled it.

Dumbledore knelt beside him as well, his wand out. Draco tried to pitch his voice at an acceptable level to explain the curse, but Dumbledore already recognized the damage.

He saw the Headmaster's lips move as the proper healing charms were implied and then there was a tickling scratch in both his ears as the ruptures were mended.

"-should stay still," Dumbledore was saying. "You won't be fully healed until tomorrow."

It really didn't matter. Draco didn't feel up to moving.

"Claire had a Portkey," he reported.

"As did the other Death Eaters," said Dumbledore. "It appears the Death Eaters were able to reproduce, at least roughly, the cloak of Merlin. I'll be able to ward against these specific charms so we won't have any more uninvited visitors."

The Headmaster moved off and Draco looked to Bill.

"Everyone else?" he asked.

"Lupin's a bit knocked up and Charlie got singed, but he's used to it. Come on, let's get you someplace more comfortable."

Draco allowed Bill to haul him up and Dumbledore did a good job fixing his ears because there was only a slight residual dizziness. Bill helped him over to the couch while Mrs. Weasley called the others to help pick up the Christmas tree.

"Hey, this one made it," said Fred, picking up a porcelain angel from the ground.

"This one too," said George, holding up a glass snowman.

"Everything appears to be intact," said Mr. Weasley.

Ginny looked over at Draco with a smile. He shrugged, but then the entire family looked over at him and he flushed.

"You're unbelievable," said Bill. "An unbreakable charm while you battled a Death Eater?"

Draco shrugged again. "It seemed like it would be a good idea."

Bill shook his head and laughed, Fred and George joining in. Mrs. Weasley stepped over and Draco tensed, but she simply bent and kissed his cheek.

"That was very thoughtful of you," she said. "How are you feeling?"

Despite Draco's assurances that he was fine, he found himself with a soothing cup of tea and a warm blanket minutes later. The tree was quickly set to rights and Ginny took the seat next to him on the couch.

"So, how does it feel to save Christmas?" she asked.

Bill and Fleur tucked Lukas into bed after all of the excitement and then helped set the dining room to rights before joining the rest of the family in the living room. Bill immediately looked to Draco, seeing the blond sitting with Ginny on the back couch. Draco seemed to be fine, but he was also holding very still.

Bill sat with Fleur on the loveseat and then his mother switched on the radio for some light Christmas music. The tension gradually dissipated from the room, helped along by the quiet laugher from Fred and George, who were sitting in front of the fireplace and turning the flames different colors.

Hermione came in with a few mugs of tea, peppermint from the smell, and the scent gradually filled the room, mixing with the dark scent of pine from the tree. Fleur sighed beside him and snuggled against his shoulder. Bill settled in as well, wrapping his arm around her.

Fred and George started a silenced game of Exploding Snap and Bill watched for a while before motion out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. Ginny was helping Draco lie down, the blonde's expression tight. Bill wondered if he should get him some pain reliever, but Draco's expression eased as Ginny began running fingers through his hair.

A short Christmas story came on the radio, a holiday classic about love potion in the eggnog. His family laughed quietly at the appropriate parts, Harry and Hermione laughing harder as the jokes were new to them.

Bill glanced over at Draco, wondering if he had heard the story before, but Draco seemed to be having trouble paying attention. His eyes were fluttering shut before springing back open. Bill didn't doubt that Draco had never voluntarily fallen asleep in a roomful of others before.

Fleur was drifting off beside him, and Ron was stretched out on the floor, eyes closed. At the end of the story, Hermione and Harry moved to the long couch on the side wall, Hermione curling up and resting her head on Harry's shoulder.

Still, Draco fought sleep, running a hand over his face.

Fleur nestled further into Bill and he breathed in the scent of her hair, gently stroking her shoulder and letting out a sigh of contentment. His mother picked up a pair of knitting needles and the steady click-click furthered the sleepy hypnosis.

Bill watched Draco shift, turning onto his stomach and blinking rapidly at the others in the room, trying to stay alert.

'It's okay,' Bill wanted to tell him. 'Just close your eyes; it's alright.'

Of course saying that would just cause Draco to snap wide awake and pull his guard up even more, so instead he tried broadcasting soothing thoughts towards the blond. Telepathy was a myth; but Legilimancy and aura readings weren't.

Ginny still stroked Draco's hair and Bill watched Draco sleepily raise his hand and gently hold onto Ginny's knee, as if trying to keep her there. Ginny reached down with her other hand, taking his and lacing their fingers together. Bill watched the grey eyes slide shut after a few valiant efforts to stay open with satisfaction.

He settled back and closed his own.

Again, I won't be updating next week as I'm out of town for a bit on vacation (yay!). Please leave a review as I'd love to hear what you think of all the Christmas stuff in the wrong season, lol!





19. Unexpected Christmas Gifts

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I think I might use the money to take over the world. Why? Because, really, what else would you do with all that money?

Author's Note: Apologies for the weight. Vacation was a bit longer than I thought (grin!). Also, it's a bit hard writing Christmas fluff in July. Luckily, we're moving on to some real plot next chapter. Huzzah!

-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-

In hindsight, Draco should have figured that setting up a Portkey to transfer Death Eaters who were searching for the Order headquarters right into the real Order while said Death Eaters were wearing the cloak of Merlin should call for more preparation. However, once everything had settled down, the benefits of such a risky maneuver really made it worthwhile. Besides, how was he to know that the Death Eaters would have had the insight to duplicate the cloak of Merlin?

Still, there was minimal damage to the Order and to the members, and the next day, after his ears had finally healed, he and Dumbledore were able to pick apart the cloak and set up wards that would defend against any attempts at entry. Even without the wards, it would be another feat of the Death Eaters to actually find the Headquarters, but just to be on the safe side, Draco sent out a few false rumors, leading unsuspecting Death Eaters into a dragon's den and other unpleasant areas.

There was an unexpected plus to the events of that ill-timed Portkey, that being the fact that Draco had saved the Christmas tree after toppling it onto Claire. Suddenly he couldn't be teased about being a 'Scrooge' and when he did hide in his study when the Christmas Spirit was on the rampage, he was no longer looked upon with disapproval or pity.

On Christmas Eve, Draco went down to find that his study door was locked and there was a note posted reading: Businesses are closed today and that means your research too. Go back to bed. Bill

Dumbledore must have locked the door, because nothing Draco did could get his study open. He was forced to spend the day with the rest of the family, playing games and drinking hot chocolate and, in all honesty, it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

They all went to bed late and, for the first time, Draco was woken up by the others, or rather Fred and George.

It was barely six o'clock when his door was unlocked. The soft click was enough to rouse him, and he rolled onto his back, brushing the hair out of his face, and then two figures were leaping onto his bed and jumping up and down. He had to pull his feet back so they weren't trampled and he stared blearily up at two identical faces.

"The hell?" he demanded.

"Wake up, Malfoy!" they sang.

"I am awake."

"Then come on. We can't go downstairs until everyone is awake."

And then Draco found himself being pulled out of bed and into the hall. One of his t-shirts was thrust into his face, which he was grateful for, having only slept in loose, grey drawstring track pants. He pulled it on and then let Fred and George hustle him down to the second floor. The twins immediately dove into the next room and Draco leaned wearily against the wall and ran his hand over his face. He stretched, feeling his spine pop slightly, and then leaned back again, completely awake. Harry stumbled out of his room next, hair even more askew, if that was even possible, and rubbing his eyes. Fred stopped in front of Harry and slid his glasses on the boy hero's face.

"There you go." He patted Harry on the head and went to join his brother waking the rest of the family.

Harry sagged against the wall next to Draco and yawned violently.

"Is this normal?" Draco had to ask.

"Unfortunately."

It took half an hour to get the rest of the house up, and Draco watched in envy as Bill and Charlie walked right downstairs, apparently not bound by the rules that held the teens in the upstairs hall.

Sirius came down from the third floor, showered and dressed, and Draco let his head drop back on the wall, completely jealous. Sirius went downstairs as well and Draco could smell coffee being made in the kitchen. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were still getting ready, and it was obvious from the impatient, resigned expressions, that this was completely normal. His lips quirked in relief when Bill ascended the stairs, holding a cup of coffee out to Draco.

"Happy Christmas," he said.

"Back at you," said Draco, accepting the mug.

He had finished the coffee by the time that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley finally emerged and walked down to make sure that everything was ready. By now Fred and George were hopping with excitement, Ron was trying to lean over the banister without taking a foot off the hallway, and Harry was grinning stupidly. Ginny came over to Draco, a smile tugging at her lips.

"Happy Christmas," she said, and leaned up for a kiss.

Draco was more than happy to oblige, but because of her brothers standing nearby, he kept it quick. Fred and George were still glaring when he pulled back.

Draco shrugged. "It's Christmas."

Harry burst into laughter and Fred leaned over the stairwell.

"Mum, hurry up! Malfoy's snogging Ginny!"

"Don't listen to him," Ginny called down. "I'm snogging him!"

There was a muted roar of laughter and an admonishing 'Sirius, please!' from Mrs. Weasley.

Harry laughed again and then pulled Hermione in for a kiss, deliberately aggravating the twins.

"And now Harry's snogging Hermione. Dad, please tell us we can come down," George complained.

"Very well," sighed Mrs. Weasley, and the rest of her sentence 'as it's apparent we can't leave you all unsupervised, you may come down' was drown out by thundering feet on the stairs.

Draco followed at a more sedate pace, Hermione just in front of him, also refraining from throwing herself down the steps. He followed her into the living room which had been transformed into a nauseating display of Christmas decorations.

Before he had thought the room was passable in a 'rustic holiday' sort of décor, with the browns of the sofas and lounges, the cream carpet, and the Christmas tree and lights around the room. Now it was a green carpet with red couches. The walls were still wood, but hung with garlands and wreaths that were transfigured from a single pine needs and would only last a day. The tree was covered in tinsel, gold paper stars hung from the ceiling, and Mr. Weasley flicked his wand, and fake, soft cotton snow began falling.

"Mon Dieu," Draco muttered in revulsion. Luckily no one heard him, and he made sure that he simply looked unimpressed as opposed to disgusted.

There were even green and red striped, poka-dotted, plaid, starred or mottled stockings in front of the fireplace with names written in sparkling gold script. The stockings were stuffed with small packages and Mr. Weasley began to take them down.

"Fred, George," he said. The twins got the plaid ones, Harry the polka-dotted one. Hermione's was striped, Ron's was mottled, and Ginny's had stars. The last one was a relief, simply green.

Mr. Weasley handed it to Draco. "We thought the plain green for you."

Draco was surprised at the stocking, his eyebrows rising, but Mr. Weasley gave him a small smile.

"Part of the family now," he reminded him.

"Yeah," said Draco.

"So the green, was it a good pick?"

Draco nodded quickly. "Yes." The answer came out a little more definite than he would have liked.

Mr. Weasley laughed. "You'll get used to all this soon enough," he said, gesturing about the room. Draco sincerely hoped not, as he prided himself in a good fashion sense, but then Mr. Weasley gently pushed him in the direction of the dining room to join everyone else.

Most of the presents in the stockings were the same thing for everyone. Crazy colored socks, quills with odd feathers, and brightly colored bottles of ink, which were actually useful when one was in the translating field.

After the teens unwrapped their stockings, it was the adults turn. Their stockings were hung along the wall and while they opened presents, Hermione and Ginny took over cooking for Mrs. Weasley. Draco was conscripted into making more coffee and tea.

Before breakfast could be served, the table had to be cleared of all gifts and wrapping paper, so the small piles were made throughout the room and then Fred and George tried to burn up all the paper with a quick flash spell. It left the room smelling of smoke, but Mrs. Weasley expertly cast a refreshing charm. Draco figured she had to be proficient at such cleaning spells with six boys.

Breakfast was large, and loud, and actually entertaining. The non-Weasleys were treated to a recounting of the past Christmas capers which left Sirius in tears, Harry gasping for breath and Hermione in giggle fits. Draco even quirked a smile, which Fred and George caught and pointed at and exclaimed 'it's a Christmas miracle!'

After the meal, they all went back into the living room, where it was still snowing and the cotton had drifted into small piles.

"Sirius," said Mrs. Weasley, "since you insisted on the snow, you will be cleaning it all come tomorrow."

Sirius shrugged, packed a handful of the cotton (which was charmed to pack quite well), and lobbed it at Fred. It hit George instead and Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat loudly at the younger twin and so prevented a snowball fight.

Everyone unwrapped their first gift together. It came in red paper with a white bow, identical for all. Even Lukas had a little package.

It was, of course, the Weasley jumper. Draco distinctly remembered mocking Ron for the shirt on several occasions. His own was a deep navy blue with a light grey D on the front. He watched as every pulled their jumpers on and followed suit, finding that it fit perfectly. The yarn was soft and made the jumper quite comfortable.

"Hermione helped with the knitting this year," said Mrs. Weasley. "There were quite a few to make this year." She nodded at Fleur. "Hermione picked out the lilac for that one."

Fleur smiled. "I love it."

"I like it too," said Bill, kissing her cheek.

"Oi!" called Fred.

"Had quite enough of that already," said George.

"Draco," said Mrs. Weasley, "stand up, let's see yours."

Draco had much rather not stand up, but Ginny gave him a nudge, so he got to his feet.

Mrs. Weasley nodded satisfactorily. "I knew that blue would be good on you. And that grey matches your beautiful eyes."

No one had complimented his eyes before. They were identical to Lucius' and that was a connection that was impossible to look over, or so he thought. He sat back down, flushing.

"Brings out the pink too," said Fred, and George laughed loudly.

Draco picked up a handful of snow and threw it. He had perfect aim and it hit the red-head right in the mouth. Fred spat out cotton balls while George laughed even harder.

The gifts were distributed at a random order, and ranged from gag-gifts to expensive ones. Fred and George got everyone, even the girls, funny boxers. Harry's read 'I'm a Seeker; wanna ride my broom?' while Draco got Gryffindor ones and Ginny got Slytherin colors. Hermione threw hers back at the twins with a shriek of indignation. They read 'Harry Potter? Yeah, I'd do him'.

Ginny smothered a laugh and buried her face in Draco's shoulder so Hermione wouldn't see her smiling. Mrs. Weasley started lecturing, but Mr. Weasley pressed a small box in her hand. She opened it to reveal a simple, but shining diamond on a delicate gold chain. She gasped, blinked back a few tears, and threw her arms around her husband.

One Christmas, when Draco was nine, Lucius presented Narcissa with a diamond necklace. The chain was made of thin, twisted strands of gleaming white gold, interspersed with tiny princess cut sapphires. The pendant was sapphire was well, large and the deepest blue Draco had ever seen. It was heart shaped and fringed with tiny white diamonds that glistened in the light. The necklace was accompanied by sapphire and diamond drop earrings.

She had put them on and preened at Lucius' praise. She allowed him to kiss her cheek.

That evening she and Lucius had attended a gala at the Opera House. After the performance, and during the dancing, Narcissa snuck away with first violinist from the orchestra pit. Lucius found them in a private box, Narcissa's back on the seat of an armchair, her legs in the air, the violinist over her. The man just had his dark socks and tie on. Narcissa was wearing nothing but the diamond necklace and matching earrings.

Lucius left, but others had seen the affair while sneaking off to dally themselves in the balcony. It had been a huge scandal, only hushed by obscene amounts of money.

That was the last time they had a family celebration. Lucius started paying for Narcissa to spend her holidays in Paris or Venice, to keep her affairs discreet while he attended political celebrations and business parties. Draco stayed home and read by the fireplace.

A touch on his arm drew him back to the present and he looked over to see Ginny staring at him.

"You alright?" she asked.

"Yeah," he said, forcing the memories back and affecting an untroubled expression.

"You were zoned out for a bit," she said.

Draco looked to the tree and realized that most of the presents were gone and that Bill was giving him a worried glance. He gave a tight turn of the lips.

"Just thinking," he said.

"Here's another," George called, interrupting anything else she might say. The younger twin picked up a small, gold wrapped box.

He tossed it to Fred who read the tag.

"To the Weasley family," said Fred. "That's me then."

George snatched the box. "And me."

"Yeah, but I'm older."

"And that makes you more of a Weasley?"

"Right."

"Boys," said Mrs. Weasley from her spot on the sofa. She didn't seem to troubled with their bickering though; she was still holding Mr. Weasley's hand.

The twins ripped the paper together and pulled out a wooden box with a coat of arms carved on the top. The lid was removed and they blinked down at the contents in confusion.

"Someone wants to marry you then?" asked George.

Mr. Weasley caught a glimpse and he sat forward.

"Fred, give that here, please."

His voice was quiet, but intent. Fred handed the box over and Mr. Weasley pulled out a ruby signet ring, the seal as large as his thumb and in the shape of a larkspur flower. Conversation died out.

"What is it?" asked Ron.

"It's our signet ring," said Mr. Weasley in shock. "Hundreds of years ago, your ancestors were lords of a small village. The feudal system gave way to a more democratic government, and no more titles were held, but the ring and the coat of arms were still kept in a treasury. The fortune was lost when Grindelwald reigned and so was the ring. I thought it had been destroyed."

He turned the ring over in his hands and then passed it to Mrs. Weasley.

"Who sent it?" asked Mr. Weasley to Fred.

"The tag didn't say."

"Florean Fortescue, actually," said Draco, speaking up. Everyone turned to him. "I saw it in the vault when I was looking for the Horcrux. He was happy to see it returned to the family."

"So you stole it," said Hermione.

"Reacquired it," said Draco. "It's a signet ring. Only the blood family can lay true claim to it." He shrugged. "Thought you might want it back."

"Thank you," said Mr. Weasley, catching his gaze and nodding. Draco nodded back. The Weasley's passed the ring around the circle, inspecting the bit of their history before Mr. Weasley put it back in the box.

There was a slight pause before Bill spoke.

"What do you say we give Draco his present now?"

Draco frowned. He already had several, and while they were gifts leaning more towards the fun side, he hadn't really been expecting anything. The rest of the room, however, exchanged grins.

Bill got up, smiling widely. "Come on," he said.

Bewildered, Draco got up to follow with everyone else. They were still smiling at each other and at him, obviously knowing the surprise. Bill stopped at his study door.

"So, locking your study up actually served another purpose," Bill admitted. "This was my idea, but I had a lot of help, so this is from all of us to you."

Bill opened the door, which must have been charmed for his entry only, and then he stepped aside. The door was only open a crack, and Draco couldn't see what was inside.

"Go ahead," said Bill.

Draco reached out and pushed the door. It swung easily to reveal an upright piano, and old, antique piano, one that he knew. The cherry wood was polished to gleam, and the ivory and black keys were spotless. A matching cherry wood bench stood in front, cushioned with a cover of blue velvet. It was an Aldwin Bach piano. He stared, frozen, and then turned around. His shock was clearly written on his face and there were a few giggles and so many smiles.

"When?" he finally asked.

"The day after you saw it in the shop," said Bill. "I said that you deserved it, and I know that you wanted it, so if you weren't going to indulge yourself, I would just have to do it for you. I started putting down payments on, but there was a bit of trouble when the original bench was recovered. Luckily, it was after you moved in, and people were voicing their concerns over what to get the resident genius, so I told them about the piano, and everyone chipped in to pay it off."

Draco looked to the piano and then back. "You didn't have to."

"We know," said Bill. "We wanted to."

Draco saw the smiles, and the high-fives. He saw that Bill meant it and saw the words echoed in the family's eyes.

"Merci," he said, completely overwhelmed.

"Play something," said Sirius.

"Now?" asked Draco.

"No, when we're fifty-two," called out Fred and George.

Draco rolled his eyes, but then the girls began insisting, so he crossed over to the piano and sat.

He hadn't decided what to play until his fingers touched the ivory. It was the light jazz piece he had been working on, an original melody, but then he was reminded of all the Christmas carols he had been exposed to of late, so he improvised, throwing in Pachabel's Canon, the quick run and the descent. He had forgotten how nice it was to sit and simply play whatever came to mind.

He let the last chord fade and sat back, not turning around because there were cheers and catcalls, and his face was flushed again. He schooled his expression and turned.

"Might want to write that down before you forget it," said Bill.

"You wrote that?" asked Hermione.

Draco shrugged. "Sort of made it up as I went along."

The family was staring again, and he ducked his head, feeling the flush rise up again. He was almost thankful when Fred and George caused a distraction, but then he realized what the distraction was.

"What's this?" Fred asked, picking up a package wrapped in ivory paper. It had been sitting behind the books on his shelf.

"What does the tag say?" asked George.

Draco froze, not knowing if he actually wanted to give Ginny the present. He had already given her a gold chain bracelet with tiny rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and amethysts dangling about the circumference. It was very Bohemian looking, and while the stones were real, they were tiny, cutting down the cost of the jewelry. Hermione had advised against anything ridiculously lavish. She said that expensive was good, but not to go too far as Ginny was getting him a gift as well. It wouldn't do to make her feel out-gifted.

He liked Ginny's present to him. It was a compiling notebook, one that he could take to the library or a study or anywhere else and when he wrote in it, his words would be transcribed in any other notebook of his choice. Or, reversely, he could write a word on the page, and his notes on that subject would appear on the paper in front of him. There was even a section in the back that could be used to peruse famous library encyclopedias by simply writing the item of interest.

It was useful, but she had personalized the notebook as well. The cover was green suede, with a Black Merlin falcon pressed into the cover, his Animagi form. On the inside cover was a collage of pictures, like students did to their own books and journals in Hogwarts. Draco had always liked the look of them, a mural of memories to claim the book, but had never decorated his own books. For one, it was completely unMalfoyish. Secondly, he wasn't going to put any sort of time into emotional trinkets that were merely a whim. Finally, he didn't have any happy pictures.

Ginny had somehow gotten her hands on the picture of Lukas and Draco at the park (most likely from a collection that Sam had) and that was on the top right. There was a picture of Blaise and Pansy, grinning and waving right beside it. Below them was a collection of tiny snapshots of Hogwarts, the castle itself, the library, the Great Hall. Snape was glowering out of one (how on earth had Ginny managed that?) and Bill was in a larger picture in front of a chalkboard, beaming proudly in his professor's robes.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron were smiling in a picture by the lake, and Fleur was holding up baby Lukas in another.

He was slightly disappointed that there wasn't a picture of Ginny, but then he had flipped to the back cover and stared. Someone had taken a picture of the night after the Claire and cloak fiasco when Draco's ears were still healing.

He remembered that night, trying to fight the desire to fall asleep, paranoia battling with exhaustion. He had finally drifted off next to Ginny, and there the picture was, stretched out on the back cover, himself asleep and Ginny smiling down at him, carding one hand through his hair while the other held his hand.

"It's the only picture I had of us together," she had said when he stared at it. "You can put another in once we get one."

Draco didn't think he would exchange it though. She looked lovely.

It was a wonderful gift, thoughtful and useful. So he let Fred and George look at the package.

"It's to you, Gin," said George, handing the heavy, square package over. "From your boy."

Draco saw her raised eyebrows directed at him; he shrugged.

She neatly undid the wrapping, not obsessively so, but freeing the object gently. Two tickets to the Symphony of Magical London were freed first, and she looked them over.

"New Years Eve," she told the onlookers. "Box seats at the Symphony for a new piece from the composer of the Magician's Symphony."

Bill glanced over at Draco with a smile.

"Gives you a week to find something to wear," said Hermione.

Ginny grinned and pulled out the object that made up the bulk of the package. It was the original score of a new movement, a blank line where the title would be.

"It gives you a week to come up with a good name," said Draco.

She looked up at him, surprise in her eyes.

"I would have just dedicated it to you, but it might give away the composer," Draco explained.

"You wrote it?" she asked. "You're a composer?"

"It's a hobby; fills the spare time."

"You're a published composer to fill your spare time?" asked Harry.

"Genius," Draco reminded them.

"That's not genius," said Fred.

"That's a disease," said George.

"You could have taken up gnome-watching."

"Or pixie racing."

"Card gambling."

"Magical sailing."

"Stargazing."

"Golf."

"Golf?" asked Fred.

"I like golf," said George. "It's relaxing."

"I have a high intrinsic motivation," said Draco, excusing the accomplishment. "It comes with the inherited desire to rule the world."

"Never rule the world," advised Fred.

"Killer on the nerves," said George.

Draco let the corner of his mouth quirk. "I'll try to remember that."

-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-oOoOoOo-

If Draco didn't give the best presents, then Snape was natural blond.

Ginny lightly fingered her bracelet from Donnabella Jewels. It was from a new line, but without being in-your-face chic. It was flirty and fun and she loved it. She eyed the score of music sitting beside her. She needed to think of a good name and the pressure was a bit daunting. That didn't mean she didn't approve of the gift, but she didn't think being the girlfriend of a genius came with so many responsibilities.

Some could argue that Draco himself was a responsibility. Emotionally withdrawn, untrusting of the world, morally conflicted at times...yeah, the argument was strong but Ginny had nothing but faith in her boyfriend. He had already come so far, and that was without any sort of outside help or encouragement. Imagine what he could do with a little support.

And he would get that support from her and the rest of the Order. He was already endearing himself to the family and he didn't even know it. He returned their signet ring, gave her a symphony to title.

Bill's gift was amazing as well. Draco had talked to a few publishers in the Ancient Runes sector and had drawn up the contract for a book on the Persian Runes. Bill was getting an advance so that he could concentrate solely on finishing the runes, and one of the best writers in the business was going to help put Bill's work in writing.

Bill had laughed and grinned and pulled Draco in for a hug, and the blond Slytherin had patted Bill's shoulder in return.

"I'm giving you all the credit," Bill had said.

"You just pointed me in the right direction," Draco responded. "It's yours."

Bill had protested and Draco finally caved to taking half the credit but he swore if Bill dedicated the book to him, he was buying all of the copies and burning them.

Ginny smiled at the memory and then shifted in the cotton ball snow. They were all in the living room again, and while the snow had stopped falling, it was three inches deep. Still, it made the floor quite comfortable. She was sitting against the wall, playing with the Rubrik's cube that Sirius had given Draco as a joke.

The colors had been completely jumbled and the rest of the family had all tried their hand at the Muggle toy before giving up. Ron had actually got seven blue squares on one side before giving up. He had tossed it to Draco afterwards.

Draco had turned the square over in his hands and then set to twisting the cube in a flurry. In a little over twenty seconds, the cube had been set to order. Now she was trying to figure out how he had done it, but she had never been very good at geometrics.

After presents, they had taken shifts showering and then came back down to play with new toys. Lunch was just sandwiches as dinner would be big. Her mum had started baking on Christmas Eve.

Fred, George, Ron, and Harry were involved with an intense game of Extreme Exploding Snap. Hermione was half-reading a new book, sitting next to Harry and kibitzing. Ginny was content to watch.

Draco was immersed in a book, sitting by the fireplace and leaning back against an armchair. Originally he had been on the chair making small talk, or rather Hermione and he were talking and Fred and George were teasing the blond, still on about his composing hobby. Draco gave better than he got, but then things got rowdy as the game started. Draco got that cool expression on his face. He got that look whenever things were chaotic or loud. As a single child, Ginny didn't think he was used to the crowd.

Bill came in holding Lukas and immediately saw Draco's discomfort. He walked over and sat across from Draco and because he had the baby, the players were forced to keep it down and the pestering stopped. Bill and Draco talked for a bit, but then Draco picked up his new book and started to read. Sometime later he had migrated to the floor and pulled his knees up, like a child. He read fast, eyes darting across the lines of text and pages turning before Ginny would have had three paragraphs read.

Her dad came into the room with a platter of biscuits, a carafe of hot chocolate, and a pot of tea. He set it down on the small end table, and Ginny got up, pouring a mug of hot chocolate for herself. She glanced at Draco and poured a cup of tea as well.

She crossed over to Draco and held it out. It took a minute for him to register her presence and then he looked up.

"Thanks," he said.

She sat behind him, legs dangling over the side of the chair because he was leaning against the front.

"What's the book?" she asked.

"How the pH Scale Balanced the Wolfsbane Potion and Other Integrations of Muggle Chemistry in Modern Magical Potions," he said.

"Oh right. I read that one last week. Found it dry in the middle but over all quite innovative," she said blithely.

He tilted his head back to look at her, his lips quirking in what she knew was his version of a laugh. She grinned back.

"I have no idea what even the title means."

"It's quite good," said Draco.

"I'll take your word on it."

He continued with the book and Ginny carded her fingers through his hair. It was going to be a bad habit, she knew. His hair was fine and impossibly soft, but still thick.

She didn't just pet his hair for enjoyment though. As an emotionally withdrawn teen, that meant in a physical sense as well, and while he was a damn fine kisser, sometimes she didn't feel that he really meant it, sometimes he seemed to think it was expected and kissed her with incredible skill but without any real emotion. She was trying to get him more comfortable with touch, and rubbing his head and neck was the best way to get him to relax.

Dinner was to be at seven, so at five-thirty Mrs. Weasley had them put all of their presents away and clean-up as they were having a few guests. A few guests meant Dumbledore and Kingsley and maybe Snape, if Dumbledore managed, by some spectacular feat, to convince him to come. Ginny was sure the process would involve guilt-tripping, blackmail, fourteen logical reasons, and maybe the imperio, and that didn't even guarantee success. Hagrid was invited as well, but hadn't sent an RSVP. That didn't necessarily mean he wasn't coming.

Charlie, surprisingly enough, had invited Pansy and Pansy had invited Blaise. Traveling overseas to his parents in Italy would involve a lot of security clearance by the Aurors and, terrible as it sounded, it might not really be worth the effort. It didn't help that they were an older, Pureblood family and Blaise was in Slytherin.

It took Ginny two trips to get her presents up the stairs, and that was just because she hadn't bothered to stack anything and she couldn't use magic just yet. The third trip was because she had already misplaced a few items and had to go back down.

She only noticed the box on her bedside table when she had put her gifts away and walked over to flick on the lamp for additional light.

It was a small, rectangular box, wrapped in silver paper that sparkled when the lamp light hit it. It was decorated with white ribbons that crisscrossed and tied in a cluster of curls right in the middle. There was a tag looped around the ribbon that simply said: To Ginevra

That, right there, should have warned her not to open the box as precious few people called her Ginevra, and none of them were bound to leave secret gifts, or if they did, the gifts weren't likely to be harmless, but in her curiosity she pushed concern aside and unwrapped the gift.

The ribbons slid gracefully off when she tugged them, and the paper didn't tear but unfolded at the seams. The box was long and thin, with smoothly rounded edges. It was made of jade, a rich, deep green and in the center was an engraving, a blossom of some kind, and a curving border.

Just the box looked to cost a fortune, and it was polished to reflect better than a mirror. She took the lid off to see a piece of ivory parchment, thick parchment with a sheen. Her name, Ginevra again, was written so perfectly, so beautifully, with subtle flourishes and grace, that she thought it must be a stamp, but on closer inspection, it had been handwritten.

She picked up the parchment, intending to read the letter first, but then she saw what was underneath and she stared.

It was a necklace, and it was breathtaking. It wasn't anything outlandishly jeweled or sparkling, but it was elegantly simple, sheer lines, but really too pretty to be called sleek.

The chain was obviously new, a modern white-gold, fine link chain, thin and flexible. The pendant was a diamond, but not a clear, white diamond. It was pink. Not bright pink or a light red, but a soft, clear, even pink that seemed to radiate the color. Ginny had never seen such a shade before and couldn't begin to fathom how rare it was.

The diamond must be old as well, because it was a rose cut with beautifully pointed sides. She hadn't seen a rose-cut except in antiques. It was a good size, not medallion large, but large marble size, if a shooting marble was flat on one side and carefully faceted on the other. It was beautiful, stunning, and Ginny wanted nothing more that to reach out and touch it, but while she was curious, she wasn't completely stupid.

Instead she unfolded the parchment. The message was short and written in the same calligraphy.

Best wishes for the holidays,

L. Malfoy

p.s. It would be in your best interest to wear the necklace.

Ginny hastily set the parchment and box down, half afraid of a Portkey even though she hadn't triggered anything yet. She stared for a moment and then turned for the door but stopped herself.

She couldn't tell her family; they'd make her burn the letter and toss the necklace somewhere in the gutter. She couldn't tell Hermione because, well, the girl would tell and the Order would destroy it with revealing spells and counter curses, and really, it was too beautiful to ruined.

She would never tell Draco. What would she say? What would he think? It would stir up so many arguments that were best left for a time when such memories weren't so painful or vivid. The afterlife might be a bit too soon.

Her mother's voice carried up the stairs.

"Professor Dumbledore is here! Don't take too long."

Dumbledore would know what to do. Ginny closed the box and shoved it and the letter in the back of her nightstand drawer, trying to touch them for as little time as possible. Then she changed into the new green, v-necked shirt Hermione had given her. It was the first cashmere item she owned and she loved the feel of it.

She adjusted her make-up, meaning that she put some on, and then cast a few spells to keep the curls in her hair. She practiced a smile, banishing all thoughts about the necklace from her head.

Dinner proved to be very pleasant, and she did very nearly forget all about the necklace. It was easy with Blaise talking avidly at the table, sharing Slytherin's dirtiest secrets without any sense of censor, and with Pansy making innuendos as only a self-titled 'scarlet woman' could. She was sitting so close to Charlie, they often bumped elbows, and Ginny was sure that Pansy's leg was hooked over Charlie's under the table.

Her parents didn't understand the pairing, but Ginny did. Pansy was flighty and bored of the attention she received, so she had to keep getting more and more to make up for it. Charlie was steady, calm. He had to be in his profession. Charlie was also used to strip-clubs as he had been a wild teenager and he knew how to deal with Pansy. He ignored her. He showed her he cared by not pushing her away or condemning her, and then he promptly ignored her lewd behavior and provocative comments.

Pansy needed that, someone showing they weren't impressed by her behavior no matter how gorgeous she was. She was smart and knew when she was being inappropriate, it just had never helped her not to be promiscuous. Ginny was sure that if the girl kept hanging around Charlie, she would gradually curb her wilder antics.

Charlie, on the other hand, could use a girl like Pansy, who could keep him on his toes. Sometimes he got complacent, and after working with dragons, he could be a bit unconcerned, a trifle apathetic after a long day. Pansy was all passion and energy.

Ginny wondered what Draco thought of it and turned, but Draco was talking with Snape, or rather, debating. Something about a potion they were working on.

"This is no time for work conversation," Mrs. Weasley interrupted. "It's Christmas. Relax, have fun."

Draco and Snape cast her the same look and Ginny giggled. She poured herself another glass of pumpkin juice while everyone took seconds. Everyone except Draco of course.

Draco seemed to have an odd aversion to eating, especially when someone took notice of the fact that he rarely cleared his plate or skipped a meal. And it wasn't even that Draco needed to diet. If anything, he would look better with another half-stone because Ginny had usually gone for the muscular, solid look. Draco was slender and bordering skinny.

Today had been a good day though. No one had commented on his meals, and so he hadn't forced the bites down. His plate was mostly clear, and it had been full to start with. Ginny wondered if she could get him to eat two desserts.

They took a break before dessert for the sake of their too-cull stomachs. Tea and coffee were made and games pulled out. A few gifts were shown off, and Mrs. Weasley dragged Draco to his study to play for Dumbledore and Kingsley. Ginny hadn't been entirely sure how much of the piece he had improvised this morning, until she heard him play it again, and incorporate an entirely new carol into the song, this time 'Carol of the Bells'.

Dumbledore and Kingsley were significant impressed and Snape clapped once or twice, lurking in the hall. Ginny caught Dumbledore's eyes as the others proceeded into the living room for a chess tournament, and teams were already being decided.

Dumbledore hung back, letting the others pass. "Is there something the matter, Ginny?"

"I need your advice," she said.

"Of course m'dear," said Dumbledore, and followed her up the stairs.

She brought out the box and letter and placed them on her bed.

"As you know, when Draco went to see his father, I followed and I had dinner with Lucius Malfoy. We even danced together, but that was just so he could tell me to keep Draco away from him. I found these on my nightstand this afternoon."

Dumbledore picked up the parchment. She watched as he frowned slightly as he read the words. He put the letter back down and then opened the box. His eyebrows rose.

"This is a most exquisite gift," he said. "The pendant looks to be early Victorian era, and that color is quite rare."

"I love it," said Ginny. "I just don't want to find out it's cursed with a perpetually bad hair hex or anything." Making light of a potentially dangerous situation was a trick she learned from Fred and George. It really did help.

Dumbledore smiled. "Have you touched it yet?"

"No," said Ginny.

"Good."

"Is it a Portkey?"

"No, but there are some very old spells on this necklace."

The Headmaster waved his wand, layering a few different charms over the necklace, and color spikes rose above the box, obviously a reading of some sort. Ginny had no idea what it meant.

"Very old," said Dumbledore, "but there are some new additions as well. Curious this arrangement."

He seemed to be talking to himself, but that didn't stop Ginny from interrupting.

"What's curious?"

"There are quite a few protection wards on this necklace, old ones, ancient ones. Some are of the darker variety."

"Protection spells?" asked Ginny in surprise.

"Seems you made quite the impression on Lucius," said Dumbledore. "What did he say to you?"

"Nothing, really," said Ginny. "It was mostly between him and Draco, and then the dance…it seemed like he was warning me to keep Draco away from him so he wouldn't have to do anything else, but there were other words that sounded like he wanted to hurt Draco."

"The relationship was never a stable one, that much was apparent," said Dumbledore. "And thank Merlin it wasn't, however cruel that sounds."

"But protection spells," said Ginny. "Is it safe to wear then?"

"There are several locating charms on the pendant as well," said the Headmaster. "Those are the new additions."

"Locating charms?"

"Ancient spells newly cast, mostly blood based ones so while Lucius could track you, I doubt Voldemort could."

"So I could wear the necklace and have Lucius find me and murder me for some reason I don't know, or I could not wear it and get captured by Tom and only the necklace could have saved me."

"Those are the two worst-case scenarios, yes," said Dumbledore.

"What should I do?" asked Ginny.

"I'm afraid that's completely up to you. How do you think Lucius reacted to your presence? Do you think he really wishes to harm Draco, or maybe he was forced to?"

"It's not like he would answer if I asked. I couldn't even tell if he was lying."

"He is a mysterious man."

Ginny sighed. "Well, it's not like I could wear it anyway. I would get asked about it."

"I doubt that very much," said Dumbledore. "Another spell on the necklace is a perception filtering one. The only people who could see it, when it is worn, are those who know that it is there."

That didn't help her at all.

"I'm sorry I cannot tell you anything more definite, Ginny. But I have no doubt you will make the right decision."

"Thank you," said Ginny.

The Headmaster left the room. Ginny reached out to touch the necklace. It really was gorgeous.

-oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO-

Yay! Christmas is over. On to plot! Really though, this fluff is somewhat necessary. I need Draco emotionally developed to a certain point until I continue on, and I think he's just graduate 'Feelings 101'. He didn't receive top marks, but he's always been content with E's, so he'll be happy. Sorry I haven't responded to reviews, but this is late and I'm tired. See you Tuesday (or Wednesday, if I do need the week).

p.s. The piano is, of course, the one mentioned in the one-shot Coffee Break and Music Hour, a scene that didn't get into my last story that kinda needed to be there for this...





20. New Revelations

Disclaimer: Not mine.

Author's note: Sorry I'm a bit late. I was called into work the other day, and then my friend scored tickets to Dark Knight, so I choose Batman over all of you. I'm sure you understand, lol!

"All clear," called Kingsley, turning to Draco and Bill.

The two joined him in the guest room, Draco's eyes sweeping over the layout and possible escape routes before turning to the wardrobe he knew housed the safe. The trick was getting the wardrobe to open up into the safe and not to a collection of dress robes. Draco was sure there were a few more less pleasant options should he fail. A banshee perhaps, or a host of dormant spells, waiting for a thief.

Kingsley moved to the hall to check on the progress of the Aurors he was with. The raid came two days after Christmas and had caught the Jordayne family off-guard. Draco and Bill had entered with the Aurors as private consultants, and, because Dumbledore was concerned that he might be a bit reckless, he'd sent Bill in for backup. Bill, as a curse-breaker in Egypt, was the closest thing the Order had to an Erus Feles.

Draco reached out carefully and touched the wardrobe. When there was no defense triggered, he ran his hands up the sides and across the doors. There was a faint tingle and the wood was cool to the touch.

"Got it?" asked Bill.

Draco smirked, stepped back, and cast a curse. The doors flew open, banging against the walls and bouncing back with the force. A simple flick of the wand had them still and then slide back open, leading into a small room.

Kingsley came over and peered inside. "That's it?"

"This is the atrium," said Draco. He stepped into the wardrobe and studied the four wooden walls that had expanded and then turned his attention to the back where there was the outline of a door and a large gold knocker.

"What now?" asked Bill.

"It's a Wendese design," said Draco. "They haven't made one of these since the fifteenth century."

"You sound oddly delighted at that," said Kingsley.

"It's a little exciting," Draco admitted. "It's the first Wendese I've come across."

Kingsley shook his head, and then his name was shouted from the hall. "Send a signal if you get in trouble," he said, and went to oversee his men.

"Will you be able to get it open?" asked Bill.

"Is Dumbledore mad?" asked Draco absently, studying the gold, snarling bear face that made up the door knocker.

There was a bout of silence after that question and Draco half-turned.

"Yes, most definitely," he summed up, and then began casting several charms at the wall.

"Albus Dumbledore is one of the greatest men I know," said Bill, not condemning Draco's words, but simply stating his opinion.

"And genius is another form of insanity," said Draco, explaining his comment which he hadn't meant as an insult.

"Would you call yourself mad?" asked Bill, a curious note to his voice.

"Undoubtedly."

"That's a bit pessimistic, don't you think?"

Draco grimaced, but continued casting the spells, one after the other in quick succession. "Yeah, but it has its moments."

"Such as?"

"In twenty years, I will remember this conversation word for word. I will remember what you were wearing and how you were standing. I will remember your inflections and my own thoughts at the time. Perfectly. Sometimes, it's overwhelming."

"I doubt even Dumbledore can do that."

"Probably not, but he's better at people than I am."

"Better at people?"

Draco shrugged. "I don't have a lot of influence over people. I can only get them angry to achieve my results, and because of that, I'm limited in what I can get them to do. Dumbledore can make people love him. That's real power."

"Dumbledore loves us right back," said Bill. "That kind of power goes both ways."

"A pity, isn't it?" asked Draco. "Think of what he could do if it was only one direction."

"Would that really be love? The Death Eaters don't love Voldemort because he doesn't love them. They fear him, and revere him, but I wouldn't call that love. Mindless devotion and obsession, maybe."

"So you can't love someone unless they love you back?"

"I think there has to be some level of caring on the other's part. If they had no affection whatsoever, they would never spend time with you, and you can't be in love with someone you don't know. A crush, sure, but that's more in the obsession line."

Draco let his lips quirk. "You're quite the romantic."

"And you're always the cynic."

"You'll have to forgive me. The holiday put me in a bad mood. Too much goodwill."

Bill laughed. The door knocker suddenly morphed into motion, a growl sounding from the mouth as the face turned from Draco to Bill, the gold eyes looking quite feral.

"What did you do?" asked Bill quietly.

Draco performed a complex pattern with his wand and then stepped back to close the wardrobe doors behind them, cutting them off from the rest of the house.

"The safe is actually spell-protected and the guardian of the safe, the bear, wakes when the right spell is used, but really, they're quite easy to fool. Each spell has its own level of magic. All I had to do was cast enough harmless charms to increase the magic in the room to trigger the guardian. Simple, really."

"Draco, casting spells quick enough to have the magic in the atmosphere build up means that you were casting at least three charms a second."

"Well, I did lose a spell now and then, if you were watching," said Draco.

Bill shook his head in disbelief. "So, the bear's awake, what now?"

"I just masked out magical signatures, so hopefully the guardian should mistake us as the Jordayne family and, with the doors closed, should take us right to the safe, like a lift."

"Should take us?" asked Bill.

"Well, it's been a while with the doors closed, so I'm starting to think I should have used a non-dark spell to mask us, and I'm hoping that whatever safety precautions are installed in this thing aren't the kind that cause instant death, because then, well, we'd be dead instantly and I wouldn't have the chance to get us out of here."

"What kind of instant death?"

"A wall of spikes hurtling towards us, a flame spell, a freezing spell, or the poisonous vapors of a Chici pixie. Any other gas and I should be able to vent the room, as long as my mental facilities remain intact for three seconds after the release of the substance. Gorbi vapor causes hallucinations first, followed by the melting of flesh and bone, so I wouldn't be able to do a thing about that."

"Uh-huh," said Bill, sounding sorry he had asked.

"It should be fine," said Draco. "We've at least a thirty percent chance of getting out of here alive."

"Thirty percent?" yelped Bill, but then the door swung open to reveal a room full of gold and bejeweled trinkets. Bill turned to Draco with a frown. "You were joking, weren't you?"

"You make a very good joke, Bill," said Draco seriously.

Bill made a grab at him, but Draco ducked and ran out of the wardrobe, a soft smirk pulling up his lips.

"I don't believe that nonsense of the holidays making you cranky," said Bill. "You're having a blast."

In truth, Draco was having a good time now that Christmas and Boxing Day had passed. He was finally working on his projects again, which meant an immersion in books and text and his mind was on overdrive trying to fit everything in. Because of that, come meal times when he was forced to take a break, he actually needed the respite, and found the company of the others to be strangely comforting and not trying and obnoxious. Before his move to the Order, when he worked without break alone in the Malfoy Manor, there was a profound sense of isolation and the quiet was dismal and cold at times.

Draco took a quick pass through the room, looking over the objects accumulated. He wasn't looking for anything in particular, but it was good to know the inventory of one's opponents. The safe was extremely dusty, as if it hadn't been viewed in a while. It wasn't uncommon for safes to be unopened for a century or more. Bill looked about as well, not overwhelmed by the stockpile (he'd opened pyramids after all), but simply surprised.

After the trip about the safe, Draco turned to the doors and started layering reveal spells on the entryway, looking for the marks of any other break in. There were the light cracks, which were simply the times when the family came to add to the pile or retrieve an item, and there were darker cracks when thieves had arrived.

"Well?" asked Bill.

Draco shook his head. "Not this safe. The last break in was forty years ago. The Jordayne re-did the wards on the house around then, probably because they were getting thieves, and the wards are good ones."

"How many houses do we have left to search?" asked Bill.

"Nine possible, but because I don't see any evidence that it was ever in this safe, because there were no break ins, I think I can actually eliminate three off the list, and the next probably is the Brines. I think finding it there is a safe bet."

"Sounds good," said Bill.

They walked back to the doors and stepped through the wardrobe. Draco wasn't surprised to see Kingsley waiting for him, but he was surprised at the look on the man's face. Kingsley's jaw was set, his eyes troubled.

"What?" asked Draco immediately.

"I have to take you back, now," said Kingsley.

"What's happened?" asked Bill.

"Minister Fudge has been assassinated."

Draco blinked in shock. He knew that Fudge was slowly beginning to take a stand against the Death Eaters, but he hadn't been that great of a threat, had he?

He was still puzzling it through when they stepped through the Floo and into the Order's Headquarters once more. It was obvious the family already knew, as they were all gathered in the living room, listening to the radio for any news.

"Dumbledore just told us," said Ginny. "They haven't said anything on the radio though."

"I think just the officials were told," said Bill. "Give it another five minutes, and they'll inform the press."

It took four minutes for the radio host to come on, the cultured voice trembling a bit as he began.

"I'm sorry to interrupt your scheduled programming, but we've just received word from the Ministry of Magic. Minister Fudge was found dead in his office not twenty minutes ago and foul play is expected. Aurors have already launched an investigation. I repeat, Minister Fudge has been assassinated."

Draco left the room, not needing to hear any more from the radio. He felt that the dust and the dirt from the safe was clinging to him, so he walked upstairs and took a shower. He let the hot water pour over him as he tried to work out what had happened, and how it had happened with all of the security around the minister. There were too many variables he didn't know.

He finished the shower and then quickly dressed, his distraction leading him to pick out his more expensive clothes out of habit, a pair of fitted, black pinstripe trousers and a blue cable knit jumper, knit out of young griffin wool. The cloth was softer than Veela hair and it was perfectly fitted, clinging to his shoulders and trim waist. He ran a comb through his hair before going back downstairs.

The group had moved into the dining room, the radio sitting on the table. Mrs. Weasley was pouring tea, and the family was whispering theories as the same information was being played over the radio.

"Nothing new?" Draco asked, sliding in next to Ginny. His hands were on the table and she entwined her fingers through the one closest to her. He ran his thumb down the back of her hand.

"It's been confirmed it was an assassination," she said. "Nothing else."

"Who would have done it, though?" asked Harry.

"Besides the obvious?" asked Fred.

"But Fudge wasn't proposing anything that would be a threat to Voldemort, was he?" asked Hermione. She looked over to Draco, who gave a shrug.

"I have a feeling we don't know everything yet," he said.

Mrs. Weasley handed him a cup of tea and he nodded his thanks. Conversation died out as the radio host came back on, but again, nothing had changed.

"What's taking them so long?" asked Ron.

"The scene has to be catalogued," said Draco. "Photos taken, and all that. Then the Healers have to confirm the death. My guess is, something happened that has thrown them all for a loop, something dark, probably. They'll have to call in experts."

"Like who?" asked Hermione.

"The Prevention of Dark Arts Society, the Compilation of Ancient Knowledge Association, the Dark Arts Identification team, and a few others depending on how stumped they are. And because most of them are funded by the government, several independent specialists will be summoned as well in case of a conspiracy."

"Do you think there was one?" asked Harry.

Draco shrugged. "I don't have enough information."

The Floo flared to life, and everyone turned to see Kingsley step through. He was still wearing his red Auror robes and his face was grim. He turned to Draco.

"Mr. Malfoy, the Ministry of Magic asks that you provide the Auror force with a consultation concerning the death of Minister Fudge."

"Who the hell in the Ministry would ask for my opinion?" asked Draco.

"I am not at liberty to say. The members of the cabinet each contributed a name in full confidentiality. I am to escort you there if you accept this duty to your country."

"Of course," said Draco.

"I can wait while you collect anything you may need."

Draco shook his head. "I've my wand. That's all I'll need."

He squeezed Ginny's hand before getting up, but she didn't let go. She pulled him down to kiss his cheek.

"Be careful," she said.

"The murderer's long gone by now," said Draco. "I'll be perfectly fine."

He was half right.

He arrived at the Ministry which was nearly deserted, save the Auror guards posted at every conceivable entry way. Kingsley led him through the atrium and then they took the lift that was specifically set aside for the Minister's, or an emergency's, use.

Draco was led to the outer office of the Minister where several men and women had already gathered. He recognized them all as the head experts of dark magic organizations, and they all recognized him and stared in shock.

Dumbledore was the last of their group to assemble, and he raised his eyebrows at Draco, but still managed a small twinkle.

"Quite surprised to see you here," he said. "I didn't know your skills were known to the cabinet."

"I'm quite surprised myself," said Draco, and then Kingsley was stepping in front of the group.

"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for answering your country's call. As you know, the Minister was assassinated earlier today, and as you might have guessed, the means of his death is a mystery. We have called you in, as the leading experts in Dark Magic, to aid us in the discovery of the murderer. In a moment, I will take you in to the office. The Minister's body is still there,

for you to examine, but I ask that no spell or instruments be used until you clear it with myself or the other Aurors as preservation of the scene is of the utmost importance until the assassin is apprehended. Are there any questions?"

There were none. Kingsley nodded and opened the door.

The wizards and witches hesitantly shuffled in, Draco lingering back until all of the rest had entered before stepping in himself. The office was large with portraits in gilded frames hung along the walls. There were windows to the left and to the right and facing the door was a large polished oak desk. On the floor behind the desk was a limp hand. The Minister must have been at his desk when the attack came.

The other experts made straight for the body, whispering and exclaiming and recoiling once they saw the corpse. Draco circled the office instead, eyes sweeping over every object.

"He's been stabbed," said one expert, rising from the body. "There must have been someone hiding in the room."

"If it was a simple matter of a hidden assailant, they wouldn't have called us in," countered an older man.

"You are correct," said Kingsley, nodding to the second. "The Minister returned from a conference and came into the room. His guards swept the room, as customary, and then waited outside. Half an hour later, the guards entered and found his body. As you can see, there are several instruments in the room to detect any unwelcome presence, and none were triggered."

Draco had already noticed the dark magic detectors and knew that additional wards on the room would not let anyone enter without specific permission.

The experts left the body and began searching the rooms, some of them pulling out their own detectors and pointing them about the room. Draco crossed over to the desk and stepped behind it.

The Minister was lying on his side, but his torso was twisted so that the small, jeweled hilt in the middle of his back was almost purposefully displayed. Draco knelt, and studied the hilt. It was silver and smooth and studded with sapphires so blue they were nearly black. There was a large diamond pommel on the end. It was too small to be a knife. It was a letter opener.

It was hard to think. The experts were talking amongst themselves, throwing out theories, or quizzing Kingsley, or shooting down the other suggested possibilities. It was too chaotic.

Dumbledore joined him behind the desk.

"Any thoughts?" asked the Headmaster.

"He was standing when he was killed," said Draco. "The chair has a back, so it would be impossible to stab him through the leather." He stood up and regarded the position of the body. "He was turned to the left when he was killed, and the stroke was instantly lethal. He didn't hit the desk when he fell, so maybe he was getting up to leave, or returning to his desk. He never saw his murderer."

"So I concluded as well," said Dumbledore. "Now the only questions that remain are how and who."

"I would be interested in the why as well," said Draco. "I've seen this letter-opener before." He looked at the Minister's corpse once more before turning to the window, wondering if this was the last view Cornelius Fudge had seen before his death.

"What about an Inferi?" one of the experts called out.

Draco rolled his eyes. They must really be desperate for an answer if they were considering a reanimated corpse. He swept the room again with his eyes, looking for anything that could lead to an answer.

The assassin must have been in the room to begin with, that was certain, but how were the detectors evaded?

"What about the knife in the Minister's back?" a woman asked Kingsley.

"It is a letter-opener," said Kingsley. "It was an anonymous gift that the Minister received a few weeks ago."

Of course it was anonymous. If Lucius had planned the Minister's assassination with that knife, he wouldn't have signed his name to the card.

"Could it have been cursed?" the woman asked.

"All gifts are screened before they are given to the Minister, and it passed through every screening."

"Did the portraits see anything?" one of the experts called out.

"No," said Kingsley. "That was the first thing we asked."

Of course the portraits hadn't seen anything. That would be the first obstacle the assassin would need to overcome, but how? Could the portraits have been mind-wiped? Was that even possible?

Draco looked over the portraits but then he stopped at the portrait of Edward Donahue, the Minister from 1901-1908. The man was posed behind the Minister's desk, a few objects on the table, a parchment, a quill and ink bottle, his nameplate and a small, golden globe, and there, to the side, was a silver and sapphire letter opener. The blade was stained red and had formed a small puddle on the desk.

Draco stared at the small knife and then back up to Donahue. The man's eyes were slightly manic and his hands were trembling.

He turned from the portrait and walked over to Kingsley.

"Have you ever heard the ghost story about the haunted portrait?" he asked. "There was an enchanted portrait in a study, and at night the portrait would crawl out of the frame and murder whoever was in the room."

"You can't be serious," said a dark magic expert, looking up from his detector. "That's a child's horror story."

"Did you know that in the fifteenth century, a portrait was burned after it was accused of killing a housekeeper?" asked Draco.

"That was because there were no other suspects and there was a superstition regarding the man in the portrait."

"The man in the portrait had been accused of murder himself, even though no one had been able to prove it. Edward Donahue, Minister in the early nineteen hundreds, once killed a man in self-defense."

"Edward Donahue has been dead for over fifty years," said another man, and now all of the experts were listening in. "You can't accuse him of the murder, and you can't honestly expect us to believe that his portrait left its frame to kill the Minister. It's impossible."

"Then why does Donahue have the murder weapon in his picture and why is it covered in blood?"

His question was met with silence and then Kingsley strode over to the portrait and the rest followed.

"Sweet Merlin," one whispered.

"The others wouldn't have been able to see him," said Draco. "Portraits have trouble seeing magic, because it's inanimate, and Donahue would have needed a magical form to escape from his painting. The clue to the assassin is in the letter-opener. Donahue would have only been able to manipulate a solid object that was also in the painting."

Once the other experts were dismissed, it took Draco and Dumbledore half an hour to determine the actual spells used on the portrait. With each passing minute, Draco became more and more certain that the letter-opener Donahue had stabbed in the back of Minister Fudge was one that Lucius owned but never used. He said nothing though. He wouldn't be able to prove it.

Dumbledore noticed that something was bothering him, though he did not comment on it. As soon as they had a rudimentary idea of the spells, Draco excused himself, somewhat abruptly, and left.

He took the stairs to the atrium, needing to move to clear his thoughts. His father had been the one to plot the assassination of Minister Fudge. He didn't know why or what would be gained with the death. He didn't know if he should tell anyone, didn't know if he wanted to accuse his father. He didn't even know why he had been brought here.

He reached the atrium without reaching any answers, and it frustrated him. He strode over to the fireplaces, intent on leaving, when a voice called out. Draco turned, seeing a red-haired young man waiting in a side hall.

Draco suddenly noticed that the Auror guards were suspiciously absent, and he reached for his wand before stepping into the hallway. The young man looked to be five years older than he, dressed in standard business robes and with his neat appearance and brown glasses, quite unremarkable if he had been standing in a crowd. He was not in a crowd, however, and there was something about his posture, confident and poised, that made Draco pause.

"Percy Weasley," said the young man, holding out a hand.

Draco shook it. "Draco Malfoy."

"I suppose you might be wondering why you were on the list of dark magic experts," said Percy. "I switched your name out with another; hope it wasn't too much of an inconvenience."

"Not at all," said Draco, his brow furrowing.

"I'm Assistant to the Minister," said Percy. "I heard that you were quite good with dark magic and on the Order, so I thought you would be a good addition to the team. I may have switched your name out with another that a cabinet member suggested."

"Dumbledore was on the list," said Draco.

Percy pushed his glasses up and leaned against the wall. "I'm afraid I don't agree with the Headmaster of Hogwarts. He was always more comfortable with using his relationship with others to get the results he wanted, to get them to fight for his cause. Some might say he was manipulative."

"I believe I've said the same thing on occasion," said Draco. "I'm also in the Order. What makes you think I'm any better?"

"Oh, you're probably even worse," said Percy, "but you don't have my family following your every whim and I think you can keep a secret. You see, the Order isn't the only resistance group out there. We've one right here in the ministry, commanded with doing everything possible to search out and stop Voldemort from rising to power while answering to the laws of England. Vigilante groups are simply not what this country needs at this time, but I'm afraid I'm the only one in my family who sees it that way."

"There's a Ministry group now," said Draco, absorbing that information. "You're a part of it."

"Civis Arma," said Percy. "The People's Defense. I'm assistant to the head of that as well. I do assisting well. Anyway, the point of this diatribe is to say that Fudge had just been informed of our group and had approved additional funding."

"If the Minister isn't aware of your presence, how are you answerable to the laws of England?"

"The People's Defense was started in the fourteenth century. The Head of the Cabinet, who is elected by popular vote, is given the authority to call it into action. All records are kept in a vault and any one of the group can reveal them to the public if they feel the power is being abused. It's not a perfect system, but we have rules."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I want you to know that we're here, and if you ever get any information that might help us, feel free to contact me. My Floo is private, but if you want to get in touch, it's 'Lucubratio' to get through. I have a gut-feeling that vigilante is your style because they were the ones to first accept you. The government shouldn't be abandoned in times of war and a lot can be done through the official channels."

"A lot can be done," Draco agreed. "The portrait, Edward Donahue was magically animated and given form. There was a letter-opener in Donahue's picture and the actual one was given to Fudge because Donahue would be able to wield it. You'd probably have found out on your own, but now you don't have to sneak around."

"Appreciate it," said Percy.

Draco nodded and turned. He took a few steps before stopping and looking back.

"I should have figured you'd be part of some resistance group. It makes no sense that a Weasley would back down from a fight."

Percy gave a rueful sort of smile. "I've just a different set of morals."

"You could at least pretend to agree with them. If you joined the Order, you'd know what was going on."

"Do you really know what's going on? Albus Dumbledore is a man of secrets and he's working to his own end. It's a happy end, to be sure, but sometimes the means to the end is overlooked."

"You're more idealist then the rest of your family," said Draco.

"No," said Percy. "I'm just smart enough to see past my feelings. I've always been a bit too Slytherin for them, no offense."

"None taken," said Draco.

"Well, thanks for the information. I've got to be along, the guards will be back soon."

"Before you go," said Draco, "you should know something the Order doesn't. That letter-opener? It belonged once to Lucius Malfoy."

Percy blinked. "Your father."

"Disowned," said Draco.

"Sorry. And thanks, but…if you weren't going to tell the Order, why are you telling me?"

"Because you won't be able to prove it," said Draco. "And because a minister's death should be handled by the Ministry, not a group of civilians. Besides, you might have a leak in your Defense."

"Because it's unlikely that Fudge's death, right after he started funding us, is a coincidence. Believe me, we know," said Percy. "Also, how sure are you that we won't find anything on Lucius? I don't want to waste time on a man we won't be able to convict."

"That's another reason I told you," said Draco. "And let me put it this way, unless the Inner Circle comes forward with evidence, there's no way you could pin that on Lucius."

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

When Lucius was a child, he had been taken to a market in Paris. His governess was sure to steer him away from the areas holding dark objects and dark wizards, but Lucius had caught glimpses of the strange beings and mystical objects and had been fascinated. He escaped his governess and wandered the twisted alleys hemmed by colorful tents and terrible creatures.

He had not been afraid, though only ten at that time. He had been surprised when the old hag had shrieked and grabbed him but he stared right back into those pale eyes.

"Not afraid, are you, my little Light One?" she had rasped in a high, crackling voice.

"Should I be?" he had asked.

"Even if I said yes, you would not feel fear. Come into my tent, and I will tell you your future."

The tent was dark and thick with the musk of incense. It stung his eyes and his shoulders ached where her sharp nails had clenched. He said not a word.

The crystal ball on her table was large and perfectly clear, but as soon as he approached it, fog had arisen inside, obscuring his vision.

"You are from a powerful family," said the hag, "and that power will grow under you. Your name will be revered and hated, awed and despised. You have the choice to choose one or the other, and you would succeed in your endeavors, but in doing so, you would lose that power."

Lucius stepped closer, wondering what she saw. The fog changed and a shape appeared. She gasped, flinching backwards.

"Allies you will make; allies that would see the world burn. The Dark One will come; you will follow his example but not in his footsteps. With your light, you could save or destroy him, though you will see neither."

"What Dark One?" asked Lucius.

The hag stepped towards him, grabbing his hands and turning them over.

"You are untouched by Fate," she said. "She cannot take you. When you die, it shall be a manner of your choosing."

The crystal ball burst with fire from the inside, a great, glowing light. The hag shied away, her arm thrown over her face. Lucius stared and stepped closer.

"What does that mean?"

The hag met his eyes. "Salvation is in the sun." She threw a cloth over the ball, but the light still shone through. Lucius left the tent.

His governess had been cross with him, and his mother had fired her on the spot.

Lucius had thought on the hag's words as he had grown. It was why he may have joined the Dark Lord, but with his passing, had not carried on his plots. It was why he used underhanded tactics to get his way, but refused to reveal his real power to those that opposed him. He would keep his power. He enjoyed being the enigma.

Perhaps plotting the murder of the Minister was a bit too evil. Maybe he would donate to a charity afterwards, secretly of course.

He picked up the morning paper to read of his plot. The Minister's death was the headline, of course, and the report detailed the method of murder, an enchanted portrait. The paper did not give the name of the expert who determined the means of assassination, but Lucius knew. He had his own contacts in the Ministry, and so Lucius kept informed of every going on. Lucius did not share his informants with the Dark Lord, though he did on occasion divulge the information gleaned from his spies. This knowledge he would not have to reveal. It would come out on its own.

Lucius put the paper down. The fact of the matter was that Fudge was starting to grow a backbone. He was funding a secret Ministry group to gather intelligence on the Death Eaters and counter their attacks.

There were other options, of course. Lucius knew most of the members in the Arma Civis. It wouldn't be much to have the key members killed, John Kelly, the Head of the Cabinet. Helena Greenwich, Rudy Costace, top Aurors. Jonathan Felix, also on the cabinet. Percy Weasley, assistant to the Minister, and as the assistant position was not appointed, he would be assistant to the next Minister as well. Yes, there were other deaths that would shake the new group as well.

But the Dark Lord had not heard of these names. All Lucius had said was that Fudge was funding a group to counter his influence, and the Dark Lord had ordered the Minister's death. Lucius had agreed, and the plan had succeeded without incident, but for some reason, Lucius had known something was wrong with the way the Dark Lord had pressured his hand. He had known that, but had not been able to muster the emotion needed to feel concerned.

"Your plan was quite successful," said a voice behind him.

Apathy, Lucius mused, when the voice neither chilled nor angered him. It was not the purposefully detached state he always strove to achieve; instead he was too far removed, the world lightly covered in a fog he had to strain to see through.

Had his sins finally taken root in his body, slowly insinuating their pale, ghostly tendrils through his veins, freezing his blood? It was as if he could feel them now, working down through his limbs, numbing the muscles. They spread up, encompassing his mind. They deepened, swallowing an already hardened heart.

Lucius stepped closer to the fire.

"Of course it was, milord. It was my plan."

A chuckle that was not entirely amused. The black cloaked figure stepped further into the study and Lucius turned. The black was such a contrast to the browns and golds of the room, the firelight casting a red glow on top of it all, that Lucius fancied he could see the Dark Lord's tainted, stained Aura sifting into the room, dimming the light.

That was, of course, preposterous. His own should have dyed this room black many years ago. Perhaps that was why he'd always avoided dark robes, to reassure himself he wasn't leaving black, oily stains wherever he went.

What was this mood that had come over him so gradually he had no chance to discard the doubting thoughts before they overwhelmed him? Was this madness or simply the effect of a life spoiled on murder and theft?

"Lucius," said the Dark Lord, drawing his name out. "It is no wonder some of my followers find you arrogant, too arrogant for service to me."

"Bellatrix is a loyal devotee," said Lucius. "She is your most faithful servant because she has no thought expect your own thoughts, your own power and glory."

"And you do not think of my power or glory, Lucius?"

"Because she cannot see past you, milord, she is exceedingly short sighted. An effective servant sees more than the master's desires, but sees which enemy must be targeted first, what battle can be won, and through it all, maintains a separate consciousness from the lord. She suffered in Azkaban for you; I built an empire."

"But tell me, Lucius, do you value your empire more than mine? Do you value your rule so that you will not bend a knee to mine own?"

"Do you desire me to kneel?" asked Lucius.

"There was a time when you would kneel and not ask my desire."

Yes, there was a time such as that. A time when it was easier to endure such small, ingratiating acts to soothe a wounded pride, but in his growing years, such a farce was harder to maintain. Questions haunted the corners of his mind. Was this all he had to show for his years? A perceived second to a man who fought in the name of purity but was a half-blood himself?

"There was a time when my knees did not creak or ache at such use," said Lucius lightly.

This time the chuckle was amused.

"We are both growing old, are we not, Lucius?"

"I fear that I will feel the age sooner than you, milord."

"Indeed you shall. You have not my ways of staving off the reaper. Then again, a man without an heir always feels the call to leave this world more strongly than a man with healthy sons."

There it was; the dig at his son. Lucius had been waiting for it. A day hardly seemed to pass without the Dark Lord's mention of Draco.

"Quite so," he said. There was really nothing else to say on the matter. He was quite immune to such comments. Bellatrix and the others had insulted him in every possible way because of Draco's affiliations. The continual mention had made him numb.

He crossed over to his small table, and pulled the top off of a crystal bottle of brandy. He poured to glasses and then passed one on to the Dark Lord.

"When did you begin drinking in the morning, Lucius?"

He started at the end of spring; it became somewhat of a habit a month ago.

"Holidays, milord."

The Dark Lord raised his glass in a toast at that. Lucius savored the brandy, the alcohol creating a slight burn that helped to clear his head.

"When will you choose a new heir?" asked the Dark Lord, passing his glass back. Lucius poured him another.

"In time. Perhaps I shall have another son."

Having another son would mean either coupling with Narcissa or having her killed to claim another wife. Neither option tempted him. He had never thought he would have to choose between the two. Draco had always been the ideal son, so much so that having another, having the spare, would be a slight to Draco. But what now?

"Surely there is someone you trust enough to name your heir," said the Dark Lord.

And there it was. The Malfoy fortune was always coveted, even by the Dark Lord it seems.

"Of course there is," said Lucius. "But I had hoped to leave you someone to take your drinks with when I am gone."

The Dark Lord smiled. "What shall I do when you are gone, my Light One?"

Lucius smiled as well, a smile that was infinitely colder and infinitely less amused.

"Simple, milord, I shall just never leave."

Lucius toasted the Dark Lord with his glass and drained it.

"If you don't mind, I'll put these old knees to bed."

Oh, no. Something's going to happen soon, but what? Leave one!





21. Parseltongue and Politics

Disclaimer: If I owned Harry Potter, thousands of fans would line up at my door if I were to miss a deadline. They would proceed to tie me to my computer and force caffeinated beverages down my throat until the next chapter is done. While many of you may wish to do this, I am merely a fanfic writer who likes to play with other people's characters, so you cannot.

Author's Note: This chapter sets up pretty much the rest of the plot for this book, and a bit of the fourth, ergo, it took me a while to get everything in place. Apologies for the wait. I will not have a chapter up by this Tuesday, but the following week. Oh, and I was told by my sister and a few reviewers that I was completely unclear with the portrait murder, so don't fear, that's explained here with a completely convenient interview by K. Shacklebolt.

oOoOoOooOoOoOooOoOoOooOoOoOooOoOoOo

Draco and Bill got back to the Order from another Auror raid early in the morning. The rest of the house was just sitting down to breakfast, somewhat bleary eyed, although Sirius had been up since Draco and Bill had left on the raid.

"Well?" he asked.

Draco nodded. "The Jordayne safe was broken into roughly fifteen years ago."

"What now?"

"I cross reference my knowledge of the Feles with the Auror list, talk to a few people I know, and come up with a suspect pool. From there on it should be relatively straight forward. We find the thief; we find the cup. We should probably raid one more house, just because Auror raids are rather conspicuous, and the Dark Lord is probably getting word of what houses we're searching. He had the same idea with having Claire check the safes, after all. It wouldn't take too much to get ahead in the search for the last horcrux."

"But you're smarter than him, right?" asked Sirius.

"What?" asked Draco.

"Voldemort. You're smarter than him right?"

Draco shrugged. "It's not entirely a matter of intelligence, but acquired knowledge and information. He's got me beat there."

"But are you more intelligent than him?"

"Probably," said Draco, shrugging again. He sat in the chair next to Ginny and poured himself a cup of coffee. He looked for the paper and saw that Mr. Weasley had it, his face frowning as he read an article.

Draco very much wanted to ask what it said, knowing that the three possible candidates for Minister would be listed there, but he was hesitant to address either of the Weasley parents, Mrs. Weasley in particular. It was odd, he knew, because he was used to conversing with foreign ambassadors and even nobility on occasion, but that was etiquette. He was good at etiquette. He still wasn't quite comfortable with the familiar and casual address yet. Still, he had been waiting for the candidates to be named.

"Who have they put forward for Minister, Mr. Weasley?" he asked, his fingers on his right hand flying through their 1-3-2-4 pattern under the table. With his left hand, he took a sip of coffee to appear completely calm.

Mr. Weasley folded the paper down to look over. "Simon Gallup, Ralph Rawlings, and Osmond Tierney."

Draco put his coffee mug down a little bit too hard because it thumped. "Osmond Tierney?" he reiterated, disbelief staining his voice.

"My reaction as well," said Arthur with a droll note. He passed over the paper and Draco took it, reading it thoroughly and still finishing in the time it would take someone to skim the article.

"Who's Osmond Tierney?" asked Ginny, looking over his shoulder.

"He's a Governor," said Arthur. "He's always rubbed me the wrong way, and he's known to be…well, quite cruel on occasion."

"He shows signs of a classic case of antisocial personality disorder," said Draco. "Symptoms include an inability to feel guilt for harming others, an attitude of recklessness, sometimes impulsive lying and stealing, a lot of aggression with a tendency to violence, and lack of self-control. Substance abuse is common in the APD diagnosed."

"Since when were you his therapist?" asked Sirius.

Draco shrugged. "I met him once at a Ministry function and I could tell there was something off about him. He inspired me to read up on Psychology."

"I don't know why he was even put in office in the first place, much less Minister," said Arthur.

"Because many antisocial personalities also possess a superficial charm. They mimic the behavior they see other people employ."

"He's done no good for the Ministry," said Arthur. "If he becomes Minister, the entire government could be in jeopardy."

"I'll disagree with your first opinion," said Draco. "He's done a lot of good when he was in financing. He single-handedly cleared the eighty year long deficit in the Ministry. He's brilliant with numbers and has an eye for investment patterns. The trouble is, because he's so good with finances, he's saved a lot of people, a lot of powerful people, and they all owed him favors. He's an investor, and he knew when to cash in, and that's how he got to Governor and that's how he got the nomination for Minister."

"But he will bring down the Ministry," said Arthur.

Draco remembered Percy Weasley, putting his name in the Cabinet vote and pulling him aside. He remembered the promise of others in the Ministry fighting against the Dark Lord. If Tierney won, it would be because the Dark Lord put him in. Tierney wasn't a Death Eater, but the Dark Lord could offer the position, and the Dark Lord could use a mad leader to distract the people of England while he waited for the perfect opportunity to strike.

Still, if there were people in the Ministry as Percy promised, members of the Cabinet and the Auror force, the Ministry could be saved.

"I think," he said carefully, "that we should give the people in the Ministry credit where it is due. Some are figureheads and political pawns, but there are some people I could think of who would object to such a leader."

There was silence at the table, and Draco could tell from the dropped gazes and furrowed brows, that the family was thinking of their renegade brother who, in their minds, chose his own career over his brothers and sister, mother and father.

"Percy," said Charlie, the only one brave enough to say his name. It wasn't just courage though. Charlie was very much the anchor of the family, the quick temper that the rest of the family possessed seemed to skip the second eldest child. Either that or his volatile work atmosphere had quenched the flames. "Percy wouldn't allow Tierney to be Minister if he's as bad as you say."

"I doubt any one person has so much say in the matter," said Mr. Weasley stiffly.

"Maybe not, but if Tierney does get put in, Percy would be doing everything in his power to get him out again." Charlie's voice was adamant, assured.

Draco looked around to see that not all of the Weasleys looked convinced. Even Bill was frowning, as if he wanted to believe Charlie, but somehow couldn't shake the notion that Percy was just looking out for himself. Ginny appeared very much divided, like Bill, while Fred and George shook their heads. They said nothing though, not when Mr. Weasley was looking so pinched, and Mrs. Weasley was blinking suspiciously.

So this was the cardinal sin of the Weasley clan. Draco felt relieved knowing the picture-perfect family had a flaw, and that flaw was being unable to cope with anyone who forsook the family and the Order. There was no way to be in one without the other. Courage, love, and loyalty, that was what the family was based around. When that same loyalty was applied to Albus Dumbledore, who had helped protect the family during the first rise of the Dark Lord, the patriarch and matriarch simply supposed their children would have no qualms with the shift of power.

Percy saw how ardently Albus Dumbledore fought the Dark Lord. He saw what Albus Dumbledore would be willing to sacrifice to defeat Voldemort. He saw what power Dumbledore had, what power the Order gave to Dumbledore. That scared him.

Draco understood the concern, but unlike Percy, his family was not forcing him to agree with everything Dumbledore said. If Draco wanted, he could leave right then. Percy had no such way to object and turning to the Ministry was the only way he could fight for his own beliefs.

The subject was changed, but the mood stayed dark.

Draco went to his study after breakfast, intent on starting that suspect list, and he made good headway, but the theft had taken place when he was a mere child of two and not even living in England. He was familiar with the more famous Feles, but the really good thieves weren't known at all. He would need to take a trip into Knockturn Alley in the near future, preferably tonight or tomorrow.

He sighed, but actually put the list away before he gave himself a migraine, or rather, a tension headache, by trying to draw conclusions on too little information. Putting such a project aside would have never occurred to him before. He would have continued to work, and he would have made a bit more progress, but that the cost of exhaustion. It was startling how easily he put the project down. He wondered what else had changed through his associations with a group of Gryffindors.

Draco pulled out the book on Parseltongue Harry had given him and flipped it open. He couldn't even begin to speak some of the combinations, but there were a few words that sounded similar to an ancient Persian dialect, used by warlocks of the highest order.

He doubted that he would ever truly speak the language, but that didn't stop him from sounding out the few easy words, his voice halting but getting quite close to the real pronunciation. He was so intent on the words, he didn't notice the knife slowly rising into the air. It was the blade that the Dark Lord had stabbed through his arm. It had been placed on the top of the bookshelf, and now it was floating above the shelf. When he stopped speaking, fell with a clatter.

Draco jerked up at the noise, his hand going for his wand even as he stood. He stared at the knife on the bookshelf. What had happened?

He stepped over and examined the weapon. It didn't appear to be any different, completely unchanged from the first time Draco had seen it. The blade was still a gleaming silver with the snake furrow through the center. The hilt was still wrapped in dragon leather, another silver serpent wrapped around the hilt, it's head resting on the end for a pommel.

Draco put the knife back on the shelf and stepped back. He returned to his desk, sat, and, trying to recreate the situation, repeated the Parseltongue. The knife shifted and rose, and this time Draco kept speaking the words he knew as he got up to approach the weapon.

The knife wasn't glowing, and it was cool to the touch. Besides floating in the air, it had not changed. Draco stopped speaking and caught the knife as it fell. An idea hit him and had him hurrying back to the journal. He flipped through the pages, finding the words that could be used as spells, and the words that he could pronounce.

He picked up his wand and, while performing the flick of a simple lighting spell, spoke the snake word for light instead of 'lux'.

Blinding white light shot from his wand, spilling into the entire room, so bright he slammed his eyes shut, but it was more than light, it was heat too. Draco recoiled, instinctively dropping his wand and throwing his hands over his face as fire scorched at his exposed skin. The burst died down immediately, but his face and hands still felt raw.

He picked his wand up and conjured a mirror. His skin was pink and hot to the touch, but the flush was already fading.

Draco surveyed his room. A few papers and books had been knocked off the his desk with the rush of light, but there was no severe damage.

Draco let out a breath in a half-laugh. This explained so much. This explained why Slytherin was such a powerful wizard, and why the Dark Lord had so much strength. The serpentine language was power in and of itself.

This wasn't to say Parseltongue was the only reason they were powerful. Not just any witch or wizard would be able to cast with Parseltongue, and not just because the language was impossible to pronounce. That light charm was incredibly powerful, and it was capable of doing much more than blinding. He should have been a pile of ash with how hot that light was, even before he dropped his wand, but even though the spell was powerful, Draco still had control over it. The language was power, and the magic was power. Together, it would take a strong mind to control it. Both Salazar and the Dark Lord were strong.

This also explained why the knife was capable of staying hidden on his person. No common detection spell would be able to counteract the Parseltongue wards on the knife.

Draco had the fallen papers stacked on his desk with a quick wave of his wand, and then he started a list of the words he could pronounce, the words that could be used in spells. It wasn't much, but there were a few spells that would work offensively. He would have to show this to Harry, but not yet. He would have to further examine the effects of the spells. Controlling that amount of magic could be tiresome, and tiring in the middle of a battle was usually fatal.

This also meant the knife must have been Slytherin's. No one else had spoken the language since the Hogwarts founder, besides the Dark Lord, and obviously he hadn't made the knife; it was far too old. Draco lifted the blade with a new respect, and suddenly he was seized with the desire to make his own. If he could dissect the spells used, if he could create his own copy, then maybe he would gain just a bit more insight into the mind of the greatest wizard to ever walk the earth.

He began to study the knife in earnest, but was interrupted by lunch. He joined the rest of the family rather reluctantly but it actually proved to be useful. The Headmaster was there, speaking with a few of the adults about campaigns. Apparently Dumbledore's contacts in the Ministry said that Tierney had more support than originally thought.

Draco caught Dumbledore after lunch, before he Flooed back to the Ministry. Dumbledore turned when he approached, his eyebrows rising in invitation.

"You remember the knife that the Dark Lord used to mark me," said Draco, not bothering to make it a question.

"Yes," said Dumbledore. "If I remember correctly, the weapon exhibited an extraordinary amount of power. I did try looking at it, when you were still in the infirmary recovering."

Draco raised an eyebrow. "You did?"

"A cursory check," said the Headmaster. "I didn't want there to be any hidden curses when you began your investigation."

"Because I am obviously inexperienced when it comes to dark magic," said Draco, affecting a droll tone of voice because revealing his annoyance would only make the Headmaster give that amused sort of smile, the smile an adult might give to a pouting child.

The Headmaster's smile this time was much less grating.

"I have complete faith in your abilities, but you must forgive an old man his caution. There are curses I have seen that have not been taught in school or written in books. The search proved to be quite ineffectual though. When I tried to check it for spells and wards, all of my instruments registered the knife as being magicless, Muggle even."

Draco raised both of his eyebrows now. "Intriguing," he said, already exploring what that bit of information meant.

"Did you need to ask me anything in particular about the knife?" asked Dumbledore, after a moment of silence from Draco.

"Hm, oh, yes," said Draco, and then smoothly launched into his lie. "I was attempting to date the knife, and it registered old, ancient in fact. I don't suppose there are any books at Hogwarts that would detail the surviving possessions of Salazar Slytherin?"

"You think the knife could have been Slytherin's?"

"Or an early descendant," said Draco. "The dating came back rather vague."

He didn't know why he wasn't telling Dumbledore that the knife had been spelled with Parseltongue. Perhaps it was simply a trait that had been ingrained into him, never to reveal a possible weapon or source of power. Keep it for your own advantage. Perhaps it was the perfectionist in him, the desire to have everything figured out before he spoke of his speculations. Perhaps there was just a small voice that said 'keep quiet, you will need this soon'. Fate had once spoken to him, although he did not remember yet.

"Fascinating," said Dumbledore. "I do have a few books that might shed some light on the matter. They're in my office, in fact. The Floo is up there, and the password is Phoenix, unimaginative, I know, but the repair team uses it while they fix the rest of the school. The bookshelf across from my desk holds the volumes on the history of Hogwarts and its founders. Slytherin has a whole row of books, the fourth shelf up. You won't be able to take them out of the office, but feel free to stay awhile. Use the bell on the fireplace to call the house elves for coffee or biscuits."

"Thank you," said Draco.

"Not at all, my boy," said Dumbledore jovially. "And since I don't have any to offer you, help yourself to a lemon drop while you're there."

Draco nodded again and watched the Headmaster disappear in green flames. Draco collected a few things before leaving himself, calling up the Headmaster's office.

As he was Head Boy, the Headmaster's office was nothing new, but he had only ever entered it alone once, and that was after he had rescued Ginny from the dark ghoul, not half a year ago.

Draco stepped out of the Floo and paused, taking his time to survey the office as it was an impressive collection of magic. He took a step forward, and the candles lit themselves and the drapes pulled back from the large windows. It was sunny outside, and now the room was flooded with light, almost welcoming him in.

Draco allowed himself a few moments of exploration, not touching anything, but memorizing. There were always new objects coming in, and old ones disappearing as new charms were developed. Even without the new arrivals, he could spend weeks just examining the wards and dark magic detectors about the room.

He looked at the portraits on the wall with a little consternation, remembering the bloody letter-opener in Donahue's frame.

The bookshelf across from the Headmaster's desk did indeed have an entire shelf dedicated to Salazar Slytherin. Draco had read two of the tomes, but the majority of the books were the only surviving compilations of their kind.

He reached out to take a book, hesitating only slightly in reverence before he pulled out 'The Magic of Slytherin'. It was large and leather bound and almost falling apart, held together by magic and twine.

Draco moved back to one of the chintz armchairs and sat. He waved his wand, calling over a coffee table, and settled in to read. He read at an incredibly fast pace, but even so, he had to skim over much of the information, turning only to the chapters that detailed some of Salazar's magical inventions and possession. There was nothing on the knife, but there was a chapter on a sword belonging to him, one that Salazar had forged himself, complete with spells that were stronger than any other weapon. Rumor had it, with that sword, Salazar had even beat Godric Gryffindor with the blade. Slytherin had not killed Gryffindor then, their dispute had yet to become fatal.

Draco took note of the sword's capabilities, writing in the journal Ginny had given him for Christmas. It was more than useful, being able to write as much as he needed and not having to worry about space. The words he wrote disappeared after he filled a page, so he never had to turn to a blank sheet, but he could still review what he had written by simply brushing his fingers on an embossed symbol of an arrow in the corner.

He went through three books before his shoulders started aching and there was a warning twinge in the back of his head which proved that his migraines really were tension headaches. He called for a cup of coffee from the house elves, and was given an entire pot and mug, a set of cream and sugar, and a platter of accompanying biscuits.

Draco found a sketch of the knife in the fourth book, written primarily in Latin. He was flipping through a chapter on the later years of Slytherin's life, and there it was, surrounded by text. Draco put down his coffee.

The knife was not of magical origin, even though Draco had suspected it had been. The workmanship was so fine it could have passed as ancient elvish work, before the tall, silvery folk had disappeared back into their forests. Here, however, the book claimed that the knife was crafted specifically for Slytherin, by a Muggle, though no one knew for what purpose.

It could be that the Parseltongue spells Slytherin put into the knife were so delicate, any other trace of magic would interfere, but the book made no further comments about the knife, except that it was passed down through the generations. The knife was lost for several centuries before reappearing in the Black vaults. That explained how the Dark Lord had recovered the knife.

Draco wondered if the Dark Lord knew that the knife was Salazar's. He must have suspected, if not known, because the knife responded to Parseltongue. Then again, Nagini had been killed so that the Dark Lord could be re-bonded with his Horcrux. Perhaps he hadn't used the snake language since then.

The book went on to detail the accounts of Salazar's death. Draco skimmed this bit for any more information on the knife, having already known the story.

Slytherin's dispute with the other three Founders of Hogwarts had grown. They did not share his prejudice or see his vision of a Pureblood hierarchy. To preserve the school, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff set up wards, denying Slytherin entrance. He attacked, of course, but the wards were so strong, nothing short of the three Founders' death would allow him inside.

Refusing to be defeated, Slytherin called upon the last remaining warlock, Gorwhym the Gaunt, and his legion of vampires to his aide. In the resulting battle, Hufflepuff was mortally wounded. When she passed, Slytherin found himself weakened. The three Founders had tied him to their fate, so even if Salazar managed to kill them all, he too would be dead and unable to claim Hogwarts.

While Slytherin attempted to recover in Gorwhym's castle, deep in the Black Forest, the warlock betrayed him, wishing to take Slytherin's land and power as his own. Slytherin slew the vampire army, but mortally injured from the fight, he could only defeat Gorwhym by grabbing hold of the warlock as they fought on the highest tower and throwing them both over the side.

Drago, the last of the Ladon Dragons and captive of the warlock, then broke free and killed Gorwhym. Salazar was incinerated in the flames as well.

Some say that, as Salazar fell, he cast one last spell, one that broke the chains on Drago. He then called upon the dragon to kill him, so that he would not be slain by a traitor. Others say that Drago broke free by pure strength of will, so that he could take his retribution as the warlock had killed the rest of the Ladon Dragons.

Still, there was another rumor that said Drago killed Gorwhym, but caught Salazar and took him to the land. Salazar then killed himself, so that none could say they had killed Slytherin. That rumor was generally dismissed as Salazar's body was never recovered.

Draco copied over the few paragraphs on the knife and then stretched once more. When the tension in his shoulders didn't abate, he stood up and took a quick turn about Dumbledore's office.

Fawkes was sleeping on his stand, he had been since Draco arrived, but now he blinked awake and peered at Draco in curiosity. Draco raised an eyebrow. Fawkes lost interest rather quickly and started preening his scarlet feathers.

Draco turned to the window, looking out at the still grounds of Hogwarts. It was sunny, and picturesque, and rather boring. He turned back, the bright spot of yellow on Dumbledore's desk catching his eye, and there, right below the bowl of lemon drops, was a book. It was still open and sat on top of papers and letters and various quills. Curious, Draco approached.

He scanned the open pages, and raised his eyebrows. The Headmaster was reading up on Horcruxes.

Draco had never been able to find much information on Horcruxes, so he read the pages, absorbing in the information.

He knew the basics, of course. The murder had to be premeditated. A killing in self-defense or in a mindless rage was not evil enough to rip the soul. Premeditation rotted away at the mind, preparing the soul for the split.

Right before the murder, a dark curse had to be cast, one that would catch the soul after it was ripped from the body. Then another curse had to direct the torn bit of soul into a magical object to hold it.

This book called the objects a 'vessel' and suggested what would be needed for inhabitation by a piece of a soul. The vessel had to be of magical origin and unwarded, but other than that, the details were vague. In fact, there didn't appear to be any definite facts in the book, a difficulty Draco found when trying to research horcruxes as well.

The book also hypothesized that a small connection would be made between the pieces of the soul. If the creator of the horcrux was in the same area as the ensouled item (same area meaning same building), then he (or she) would be able to locate the horcrux without prior knowledge to its location.

Draco made a note of that. Hufflepuff's cup, the last Horcrux, so far had not been in the same house as the Dark Lord, but that didn't mean there was a way to boost that connection. If the Dark Lord did find a way to track the Horcrux from long distances, it could give him a decided advantage.

The sentence at the bottom of the page caught his attention. "After the Battle at Merlin's Staircase, the injured Slytherin was taken to his castle, delirious and raving that his soul had been torn. He would not be calmed until he received counsel from the Sorceress Morgane. A year was he mad, seeking to repair his soul, and when he emerged, he sought war against those who were not of magical lineage, beginning the Years of Blood until his death at the castle of Gorwhym the Gaunt. It was this account of a torn soul which inspired Morgane, and why the sorceress attributes Slytherin with the first Horcrux although there is no record of a Horcrux being created until--,"

Draco tried to turn the page, but found he couldn't move the papers. Dumbledore's desk was obviously charmed. Draco frowned, wondering what the title of the book was, but even closing the book was impossible. Usually such charms were put upon desks holding bank books and ledgers, to keep embezzling secretaries away, and the charm worked better when the book was closed first. Draco wondered if Dumbledore had simply run late while reading, and left before he had a chance to close it, or if he simply didn't want to lose his page.

He toyed with the notion of asking Dumbledore about the book, but then he would have to admit to snooping. He sighed and took a lemon drop from the bowl on the desk before returning to his own work. Draco figured he should get back for dinner, and he had one more stop to make before heading back to the Order.

oOoOoOooOoOoOooOoOoOooOoOoOooOoOoOo

Ginny was setting the table when her dad and Dumbledore arrived, half an hour before dinner. Both of them looked a bit grim, and, after dropping a quick kiss on her cheek, Arthur went into the kitchen to start a pot of coffee. He was immediately shooed out by Mrs. Weasley who called Ginny to get the coffee instead.

Ginny knew that coffee with dinner meant that her father would be going back to the office after the meal. She poured a mug of coffee and then a cup of tea for Dumbledore and brought it into the dining room where her dad and the Headmaster were sitting, in deep conversation.

"Thank you, Ginny," said Arthur, and Dumbledore echoed the thanks, twinkling at her merrily, as if he hadn't been looking decidedly worried just seconds before.

"What's happening at the Ministry?" she asked.

Her father sighed, but took a sip of coffee and explained.

"The Aurors have no evidence on who assassinated Fudge and it looks like Tierney might win the election."

Ginny was about to press for more information when the Floo flared in the fireplace and Draco stepped out. She smiled, pleased to note that he was carrying the notebook she had given him for Christmas. He gave that tiny upturn of one side of his mouth.

"Find anything useful?" asked Dumbledore.

"The knife was Slytherin's," said Draco. "That's all I know for sure right now, but that will help me dissemble some of the wards on the knife."

"What was Slytherin's?" asked Mr. Weasley.

"The knife that the Dark Lord decided to run through my arm to get his kicks," said Draco.

"You sound like the knife being Slytherin's makes it all worth it," Ginny teased. He did sound remarkably less bothered by the scar on his arm, but that was probably because he was excited about examining the knife.

Draco smirked and shrugged a shoulder. "I think the knife was bound to me because of it. I'm just glad it wasn't Gryffindor's."

He walked back to his study, no doubt to put his things away.

"Nothing wrong with Gryffindor," Ginny called after him.

"I'm not even deigning that with an argument," came the response.

Ginny grinned, glad that he seemed to be loosening up. He even tolerated family meals now and showed up for them without being dragged in by herself or Bill. She turned back to the table, the silly grin still on her face, and caught Dumbledore watching her with an especially bright twinkle and her father looked a little startled. He had obviously thought that dating Draco was like dating Dean, a fun relationship, but not serious or containing any real substance. She liked Dean, but she hadn't felt particularly attached to him.

Ginny blushed at their stares and mumbled an excuse. She left to help her mother in the kitchen, knowing that she was falling for Draco faster than she wanted, but there didn't seem to be any way to slow down. She already liked Draco far more than he liked her, or at least appeared to like her, and falling in love with him would leave her incredibly vulnerable to heartbreak.

Once dinner was on the table, and the family gathered around, her father spoke up.

"I'll have to head back to the office after this," he started, helping himself to a piece of steak and passing the plate.

"What's going on?" asked Bill. He served Fleur's plate as his wife had her hands full, gently bouncing a fussy Lukas.

"Well, for one, the Aurors have no suspects for the death of the Minister," said Arthur. "That's causing a good deal of chaos alone. Secondly, it looks like Tierney has a good deal of support, and they just had the first debate today."

Ginny had listened to the debates on the radio. There was a decided creep factor to Tierney, but after the whole diary fiasco, her 'creep' sense was much more advanced than the average citizen.

"The elections aren't for a week yet," said Hermione. "Is it really that decided already?"

Draco spoke up. "It's not an official election," he said. "Because Fudge was assassinated, that makes the election fall under the war time law. The Board of Governors will be electing the Minister."

"The Board is notorious for electing Minister's who will protect the Ministry's interests," said Arthur. "They will be looking for a Minister to increase their power during these uncertain times for fear they will lose their positions."

"Is Tierney a Death Eater?" asked Harry.

Draco snorted. "He's a Halfblood, and likes to proclaim it. That's why he'll be elected, because the Board thinks he'll do everything in his power to stop the Death Eaters. Those Governors who are Death Eaters are going to vote for him because having a crazed Minister is a good distraction for the rest of England. While they try to get him out of power, once they realize he's a psychopath, the Dark Lord will be able to infiltrate the Ministry, or simply wipe it out."

"Draco's right," said Dumbledore. "We'll have to do our very best to get another Minister in place. Arthur and I are adding our support to Ralph Rawling's campaign." He turned to Draco. "Could we count on your support as well?"

Ginny looked over to Draco beside her. Draco took a sip of pumpkin juice before replying.

"I can't support Rawlings," he said.

She could see Dumbledore raise his eyebrows and glance to her father. Arthur Weasley put down his fork.

"It's doubtful Rawlings would be elected without the support of an influential businessman. We were hoping you would agree to help."

Draco shook his head. "Rawlings wouldn't get elected even if you had the whole of Gringotts supporting him. Your best bet is to campaign for Gallup."

"Simon Gallup would not do enough against Voldemort. He refuses to see the threat he poses. He would undermine what little Fudge has done for us."

"And Rawlings has no charisma to him. He may be the best candidate, but backing him isn't going to do any good. He's a non entity. He was thrown in because he has a few friends on the Board, but they aren't going to carry him, and nothing I could do would insure that."

"You could try," Arthur started, but Draco cut him off.

"I'm not going to support him and hope for a miracle. If you support Gallup and I publically backed him, he would win, that's a guarantee."

The table was silent. Ginny bit her lip. Draco didn't always agree with the Order, but this was the first time he had refused to go along with Dumbledore. She was aware of the fact that this was how the split with Percy began. Well, his priggish attitude had caused a few hairline fractures, but when he spoke to their parents about his disagreement, they had refused to listen.

Ginny hadn't listened either. She hadn't understood at the time. She thought now that maybe the split didn't have to happen, maybe they could have just agreed to disagree, but there were such horrible things said that night, maybe Percy's departure was the only way.

"Draco, I would ask you to reconsider," said Dumbledore.

Bill was looking to Draco, frowning a bit in concern. Bill could read him better than anyone, but Ginny thought she picked up a few signs of tension too. She dropped her hand to his knee and squeezed gently. He spared her a quick glance before responding to Dumbledore.

"Rawlings is Pureblood. If I supported him, the press would spin it. They would say I suffer the same prejudice as my father. The help I could give would be damaged because of that, my influence lessened, not to mention my reputation damaged. If you want, I'll stay out of this campaign. I won't back Gallup, so maybe you can win his supporters, but that's all the help I offer."

It seemed a suitable compromise to Ginny. The Headmaster apparently thought so as well.

"That would be appreciated," said Dumbledore.

"But surely you could explain why you support Rawlings so people would understand," said Mrs. Weasley.

Ginny silently groaned and telepathically urged her mother to stay silent. Discussions on politics never ended well in their family.

"The Death Eaters have quite a bit of influence in the media," said Draco.

"But the Governors will realize that. Everyone knows not to completely believe the news," she pressed.

"Mum," said Ginny, finally stepping in. "I'm sure Draco knows what he's talking about. He wouldn't refuse if not for a good reason."

"But I'm just wondering," said her mother. "Headmaster Dumbledore seems to think his support would help and maybe he knows something Draco doesn't."

"He probably knows a lot I don't," said Draco, and his tone was so cool and authoritative, it was almost comical how everyone seemed to snap to attention. "However, I have grown up attending Ministry debates. I attended several cloister sessions over the years and can call over half of the Board of Governors by their first names. I am also familiar with the media. I had my first interview when I was six years old, I have attended over fifty publicized galas and conferences, and, if I should ask, I could have reporters from all seven major news companies arrive in the middle of Muggle London in a matter of minutes.

"I know how these elections will be run. There are Death Eaters in the media. They will spin Tierney as a messiah. With all of the people backing Tierney, if a Governor ever wants to be re-elected, he'll vote for Tierney. There are Death Eaters high up in office. If a Governor owes a favor, or wants a favor, he'll vote for Tierney. If a Governor looks like he won't be voting for Tierney, there are Death Eaters with death threats to insure he'll vote for Tierney.

"The only way the candidate not supported by the Death Eaters will win this election, is if there is an obvious choice, one so blatant that anyone who does vote for Tierney will be labeled a Death Eater. Put Gallup against Tierney, and everyone will see the difference between genuine charm and insincere gratitude. Rawlings is too much of a joke as a public speaker for that definition to be made."

"You paint a grim picture of our government," said Dumbledore. "Do you really have no hope for Rawling's election?"

"Sometimes you have to extinguish that hope. I understand that Rawlings is the best man, but sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils to ensure you won't meet with disaster."

The table was silent. Even Fred and George looked serious.

"That's very Slytherin of you," said Arthur Weasley finally.

"I see that as a compliment," said Draco.

"You may take it as one," said Arthur. "Some men are blessed with the ability to make the difficult decisions. We are the ones that hold out for hope's sake."

And the conversation ended. It was an awkward ending, followed by an awkward silence, but Ginny couldn't help wonder how this difference was settled so much better than Percy. Perhaps it was simply because Percy was a Weasley. It was one thing if a Malfoy and a Slytherin displayed a different political standing; it was completely different when the one displaying the difference was raised to be a conservative and a Gryffindor.

The conversation never fully recovered until dessert when Kingsley Shacklebolt stepped through the fireplace.

"Kingsley," Dumbledore greeted. "What brings you here?"

"I could smell Molly's lemon cake all the way from my office," said the large man, offering a smile.

He was bid to grab a seat and Mrs. Weasley served him a big slice of cake.

"Tea, Kingsley?" she asked.

"Coffee, if you have it," said Shacklebolt. "I'm headed back to the office, but I stopped on by to see Draco here."

The table turned to look at the Slytherin who had so adamantly shown his colors over dinner. Draco was still on edge from the political talk, and this time it was much more obvious, to Ginny at least. His face was perfectly composed and he held himself perfectly straight. The biggest tell-tale sign was that he was picking at his cake and hadn't finished his dinner. Conflict seemed to stifle his appetite.

Draco raised an eyebrow in inquiry but Kingsley didn't elaborate until he had his first bite of cake and showered Mrs. Weasley with praise. He pulled out a notebook and a quill.

"We're finally going public with the report of Fudge's death. Because you were the expert who figured it out, I'll need a statement explaining the method of murder, one that the reporters can understand, so the smaller the words, the better."

Ginny saw the way Draco slightly tilted his head to the side and hesitated. She hid a smile.

Ron laughed, finishing off the last bit of political strain. "You can't do it, can you, Malfoy?" he asked.

"How about I run it by you, Weasley, and your stare of incomprehension can warn me when I use a two syllable word." Draco responded lightly, obviously not wanting to offend. He looked to Kingsley.

"Anytime you're ready," said the Auror.

"Magical portraits," Draco began, "are classified as level two beings, having some level of consciousness. Because of this, they can be controlled, like any animal or person. The consciousness of Edward Donahue's portrait was captured with the aid of an Aspiro Orb and pressed into a Corporus.

"A Corporus is a magical body, made up of a magical fields and illusion. They are easy to create and these figures can be given simple commands to fulfill simple tasks, such as directing broom traffic in fly zones. Normally, the Corporus is harmless, unable to physically or magically interact with solid objects or people.

"The real assassin of Minister Fudge was the man or woman who gave the Minister a sapphire letter opener. This letter-opener was detailed in Edward Donahue's portrait. The process of creating a magical portrait involves taking small samples of the objects pictured, which allows the subject, in this case Donahue, to interact with the painted environment, sitting in a chair for example, or leaning against a desk or picking up a book.

"Because Donahue's consciousness was put into the body, his ability to interact with the painted environment translated into real life. He was able to pick up the real, solid letter-opener and with it, he was able to kill Minister Fudge as he was commanded. This transfer of environments is also why the knife in the portrait is covered in the Minister's blood."

"But wouldn't someone have to be there?" asked Hermione. "To spell the portrait into the body?"

Draco shook his head. "After we discovered the method of murder-,"

"After you discovered it," Kingsley interrupted.

"-we found a time-delayed spell on an Aspiro Orb in the Minister's office. It was transfigured to look like a common paperweight. The spells weren't classified as harmful, as it was simply calling a Corporus, and so did not trigger the safety wards on the office."

"The orb," said Kingsley, filling in, "could have been placed in the Minister's office in a two-week period, that's all we've been able to narrow it down to. Unfortunately, there were several meetings and conferences held in that period and it could have been one of eighty suspects."

"There must have been someone suspicious," said Charlie.

"Fifteen of them are suspected Death Eaters. Thirty have Death Eater affiliations or family members in league with Voldemort."

"Anyone on the top of the list?" asked Ron.

"Lucius Malfoy, for one," said Kingsley, and the name caused the room to turn to Draco.

Draco shrugged. "If it was him, you won't be able to prove it." He said it neutrally, but Ginny had to wonder if Draco somehow knew the truth.

"So, what good was the investigation?" asked Ron.

"If we knew nothing, the public would lose hope," said Kingsley. "We know the method and we can insinuate that the Dark Lord had a hand in the assassination."

"But that's it," said Harry.

"That's it," Kingsley agreed.

It was a grim reality that England would not know the identity of the Minister's killer. Ginny wondered how that would affect the already waning morale of the people. She knew that a couple of kids in school might be leaving the country with their parents, and after the attack on Hogwarts, it looked as if there was no place safe.

The grim atmosphere did not stay long. For one thing, the cake was too good. Another was that Fred and George took it upon themselves to cheer everyone by reciting every joke they had ever heard. The jokes were lame, and played badly on words, but it worked. By the end, everyone was laughing, and even Draco quirked a smile.

Ginny grabbed Draco before he had a chance to escape after dessert.

"Hey, have a minute?" she asked.

"Is this where I pretend to be gallant and say 'two minutes for you'?" Draco asked.

"Glib is a good attitude on you."

"And cheeky goes well with red hair."

Ginny smiled and dragged Draco up to her room. Draco pulled back by her door.

"Am I allowed in?" he asked. "Your parents didn't put a ward on the door that would turn me into a frog or anything, did they?"

"Not that I know of," said Ginny.

She laughed as Draco gazed in askance at the door and then finally pulled out his wand.

"Are you cautious through experience?" Ginny had to know.

"I've heard stories. Mostly from Blaise."

Ginny watched Draco cast a few charms on the door before giving an amused smirk and walking inside. The door shot all the way open and glued itself to the opposite wall.

"That's not going to close while I'm in here," said Draco.

"Could you take it off?"

"Easily, but I'm pretty sure your brothers would fry me afterwards, so I'll leave it."

Ginny sat on her bed and leaned over to grab a stack of papers from her bedside table. Draco still hung back until she patted her duvet. He pulled off his shoes and sat on the foot of her bed. He effortlessly pulled up his legs to sit in the half-lotus position.

"I've named it," said Ginny, handing over the score for the orchestral movement.

"That was fast," said Draco.

"It rather named itself."

She had listened to the charmed paper play the symphony once and had immediately known what it should be, although she listened to it another two just to be sure.

She watched Draco glance down and read the title. His left eyebrow arched.

"Song of Seraph," he said. "The song of the burning ones." He looked up, the corners of his mouth upturning a tad bit. "It's good."

"So, did you just give it to me because you couldn't think of a good enough name?" Ginny teased.

"Well, I thought about dedicating it to you, but then it would be pretty obvious who wrote it."

"And it's a secret because?" Ginny asked, not condemning him but curious.

He gave a half-shrug. "It's nice to have something that's purely mine, without any other expectations or requests."

"I can understand that," said Ginny. "And thank you. It's lovely."

"Even if no one ever knows that it was for you?"

"Well, I suppose it's like you said. It's nice to have something purely mine, even a secret."

Draco's lips did that slight quirk thing and Ginny leaned forward to kiss them. Draco responded, deepening the kiss but taking his time exploring her mouth, finding every spot that made her shiver. Her eyes closed of their own accord as her mind couldn't take in any more information, not when he was kissing like that. She rather thought that having her boyfriend in the same house would lead to many more opportunities to make-out, but it was probably a good thing Draco was so preoccupied. His kisses were pure temptation, inciting all sorts of wicked desires.

She forced her eyes open, finding his molten silver gaze. She pulled back with a smile and patted his legs. He raised an eyebrow, but straightened his legs in front of him as she directed. Mindful of the open door, Ginny decided not to straddle his legs and instead knelt beside him. She reached up to brush his hair back.

"Close your eyes," she whispered.

He hesitated; he wouldn't be Draco Malfoy if he wasn't wary of such a vulnerable act. She simply waited though, and he finally acquiesced, shifting to lean back on his arms and his eyelids closed. She had a moment of envy for his dark, thick lashes and then slowly leaned forward.

At the first brush of lips, he was so tensed she could feel a slight tremble from the strain. At the second, he brushed back. The third time he caught her lips, delving inside with his tongue. She had to force herself to keep her own eyes open, to watch for his, but he was a quick learner, if a bit hesitant without his sight.

He shifted his weight on one arm, reaching over and searching for her, as if he had to hold onto her if he couldn't see her. His hand found her arm and then slid up so his fingers could tangle in her hair.

He pulled back after a few moments, eyes flickering open. He looked a little bit unsure of himself and a little bit dazed.

Ginny smiled. "See?"

oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

So, there you have it. The...well, I don't know what chapter this is just yet. I lose track, lol. I would love a review, so please consider pushing that button.





22. The Start of Tyranny

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I often mourn this fact.

Author's Note: Get this. The chapter is over 12,000 words. That's right. Thirty pages. Impressed? You know it. That's why it's late.

-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-

Draco flipped through his notes and twisted his neck to the side. He was sitting on the floor in the living room, listening to the last debate with the rest of the family. Yesterday the Weasleys had gone out to visit relatives, leaving Harry, Sirius, and Draco in the house alone (Hermione was visiting her own family).

Draco had managed, before Sirius and Harry and dragged him outside to fly brooms in a magical park across town, to make a list of all the spells he suspected were on Slytherin's knife, and now he was just looking through them, trying to figure out what order Slytherin must have put them on the blade.

Over the radio, Rawlings made an incredibly stuttering statement that managed to say nothing at all. He was supposed to have answered the question, 'As Minister, what would be your response to the recent threats against the security of this country?' Draco stifled his snort. The Order was supporting Rawlings, so he figured he shouldn't act too condescending. He also should skip saying 'I told you so' when Tierney was elected. He jotted down a note and rolled his neck again.

"Here," said Ginny, coming to sit on the couch beside him. She ran her fingers over the tops of his shoulders. "I swear, you have the worst knots ever. How do you manage it?"

Draco dropped his head forward, letting her fingers knead the back of his neck.

"I think you're working too hard, or thinking too hard, or something," Ginny continued. "You need to relax."

"I am relaxed," said Draco.

Ginny pressed down on a particularly tight group of muscles and he hissed, his shoulder spasming.

"Care to repeat that?" she asked.

"You've proven your point," said Draco, reaching back to rub his shoulder.

Ginny pushed his fingers away and massaged the area. Draco slowly relaxed under the firm pressure of her hands. On the radio, Tierney answered the question to applause and cheers from the audience. Across the room, Mrs. Weasley frowned, her knitting needles clacking harder together. Bill shifted Lukas to the other arm and Charlie rolled over on the couch, eyes still closed. Draco couldn't figure out if he was sleeping or simply resting. Harry sighed and lost the game of chess to Ron again.

Fred and George were absent, as witnessed by the silence, and Fleur had gone out to stop by her office to pick up a few dresses that needed alterations. One of them was for Ginny, a Christmas present from Fleur who knew what dating Draco would mean, outings that were in the public spotlight. Mr. Weasley was at the debates with Dumbledore.

Draco rearranged the order of the spells for the fourth time, and felt that he had finally gotten it right. He put the pages down and joined Ginny on the loveseat.

"Did you want to go out to eat before the symphony tomorrow?" he asked.

"I'd like that," said Ginny.

"The symphony is at eight, so reservations for six?"

"Sounds like a plan."

Draco shifted, and then in a rare act, initiated physical contact by resting his hand on the sofa so that it brushed hers. She completed the move, entwining their fingers, and they listened to the host retake the microphone.

"And that was the response from Simon Gallup. It's easy to see who the crowd favorite is. In the audience's eyes, or should I say ears, Tierney can say no wrong. Although Gallup is getting favorable response from the left, Osmond Tierney is completely dominating this floor. Let's get a quick word with our reporter Sonya Derrick who is sitting with Tierney's campaign manager now. Sonya, what is it about Tierney that has completed captured this audience?"

"Good question, Mike," came Sonya's voice. "There's no doubt about it, the population loves Tierney, but the question is, will the Board of Governors? Tierney has an odd sort of charisma, and his campaign manager Peter Holtz is not letting that talent go to waste. Peter, how are you promoting Tierney?"

Peter laughed. "Osmond Tierney doesn't need promotion. Anyone can see that he will be a new sort of Minister, one that isn't afraid to seek change or make the hard decisions. We live in uncertain times and people are looking for a hero. Tierney is that hero."

"Not Harry Potter?" asked Sonya.

"Harry is a seventeen year old student, Sonya. We can do better than that."

Beside him, Ginny stiffened. Draco glanced over to see Harry casting an odd look at the radio before giving a rueful laugh.

"I would have killed for someone to say that years ago," he said.

"And now?" asked Draco, catching the unspoken words.

Harry shrugged. "A little support never hurt anyone. I don't want an army of devotees, but a 'good luck' would be appreciated."

Back at the debate, Sonya had asked Peter what, in the public's mind at lease, set Tierney apart from the other candidates.

"He's different," said Peter. "He smiles, he waves, and he shakes hands like the rest, but there's a certain power about him, an edge that says he's not a man to be trifled with. The public want a Minister who won't allow this fine country to fall apart, who won't let the government be run by power-seeking bureaucrats."

"So he's a dangerous man," said Sonya.

"Dangerous? No, not at all. Osmond is a kind man, but he simply is ready to fight for England, so that the people are not fighting alone."

"Thank you so much, Peter."

"And thank you, Sonya."

"So there you have it, Mike. He isn't dangerous, but he won't back down from a fight. He has an edge."

"Is that what their calling it nowadays? An edge? Sounds very trendy, and we'll be looking for it in the fashion world this spring. Just remember, as always you heard it first on Apha News. Now, the nominees still have two questions to answer, and while no one gets to see the questions beforehand, it is expected that at least one will deal with the Min-,"

Mike cut off because there was a muted, but still very audible, scream from somewhere in the audience. The scream was followed by another and another until what had been muffled crowd noises, the babble of words, the occasional thump of a chair, and a few coughs, turned into the sounds of terror.

Draco sat forward and Mrs. Weasley put down her knitting. Ron leaned over to turn the radio up.

"There appears to be some commotion down in the audience," Mike narrated. "I'm in the press balcony looking down at the auditorium, and it's a madhouse. People are trying to run, but it's too crowded, and the aisles are blocked. There's screaming and, whoa, now I see spells being used. I'm not quite sure what that is, but – Merlin's balls!

"Listeners, there are Dementors in the room, I can see them floating in now, and it's freezing in here, absolutely freezing, and…and it's terrible. So terrible. It's hard to think with all this cold. There are so many of them, there's a pain in my chest and in my head.

"Aurors are coming, I can see them trying to run in, but there's so many people trying to get out, and there aren't many Aurors on sight. They are casting the Patronus charm, but I can't see any clear forms. There are too many Dementors, and it's too cold, too dark in here to think of any happy memory. I can't of anything worth smiling about, and I'm on the balcony above this all.

"The Aurors are being mobbed with people. They're trying to clear the room, but it's pure mayhem, and chaos. It looks like the Dementors have all but one door surrounded. People are running every direction, and pushing and casting spells, trying to get out.

"I can see some people collapsing, the ones that are closest to the Dementors. The Dementors haven't started sucking souls but I can see people holding their heads and you can hear their screams. It looks to be some sort of new attack. More and more people are falling. An Auror is down as well! The Dementors are approaching some of the fallen men. I can see them pulling back their hoods. Is there no one else to help? Where is the back up? Where is-

"Sweet Merlin, look at that! Listeners, I'm a radio host, and I'm used to describing a lot of things, but this…this is nothing short of miraculous. Osmond Tierney has set off the greatest Patronus charm I have ever seen! It's a griffin, a massive, strong griffin, and it's running the length of the room, and now it's leaping at the Dementors. Its teeth look to be the size of my arm. This is a fantastic piece of wizardry!

"The Dementors are fleeing, I can see them speeding away. The griffin is rounding the room again. I don't know where the Dementors going, but they're out of the room, and now the Patronus has gone as well. People are cheering and applauding. The last Dementor just left. People are tending to the fallen men and women, calling for help. Here comes the Auror squad now. They're pushing through, and I can see emergency medi-wizards and witches arriving as well.

"Listeners, I think that this attack is over. I'm not quite sure why the Dementors attacked, or for what reason, but the worst is over. I'm going to go downstairs and see if I can't get any information from the Aurors. Stay tuned, Listeners, and I'll tell you all I know."

The station began playing advertisements and Mrs. Weasley switched the machine off. Her face was pale.

"I'm sure dad is fine," said Ron. "Dumbledore was with him."

"It was a Death Eater attack, wasn't it?" asked Harry.

"Of course it was," said Draco. "Osmond Tierney came out as a hero. It must have been planned." And then there was the fact that there was something very off about the whole attack, and Draco was sure he wasn't just feeling that because Tierney's Patronus was a griffin of all things.

"Can't we prove that Tierney was in on it then?" asked Ron.

"I doubt it," said Draco.

"So, that's it?" asked Harry. "He planned the attack and he gets labeled as the hero?"

"I could do some asking around," said Draco, "but I think the only people who would know of the relationship between Tierney and the Dark Lord would be those of questionable reputations. Bringing Tierney down would have to be an inside job."

Draco wondered if Percy and the Civis Arma would be up to the task. They were recently formed, and an eclectic collection of Ministry officials, but it sounded like they would be effective. He decided to stop by Percy's study later, and see if they needed any ideas. His father had murdered a Minister; Draco would like to depose of his own.

Mrs. Weasley turned the radio back on after a few minutes, but all the news Mike had gathered was that those who had fallen in the attack were subjected to a concentrated focus of the Dementors, a new trick they had apparently mastered, and would make a full recovery after rest and observation.

Fred and George arrived at the house a few minutes after the broadcast.

"Any news from dad?" they asked simultaneously.

"Not yet," said Mrs. Weasley.

The family and Harry, who was practically adopted, got more and more anxious by the minute. Sirius finally got up, jerking his head for Draco to follow, and went into the kitchen to make some tea and lunch in order to distract the family. Draco wasn't exactly adept in the kitchen, but sandwiches were simple and hard to mess up. He rather thought Sirius had made enough for a family twice the size of the Weasleys, and because the red-heads were simply picking at their food, most of the food sat untouched.

Mr. Weasley arrived halfway through the 'meal', and his children jumped up to greet him before he was halfway out of the fireplace. Fred and George spilled a pitcher of milk in the process and altogether it was a loud, and happy greeting and once the family had ascertained that he had not been hurt, lunch was attacked with a new vigor. It turned out, Sirius had made just the right number of sandwiches.

Mr. Weasley told them all about the attack while they ate, but Mike the radio host had described most of the details. In fact, the only difference between the two tales was that Arthur, being on the ground floor, had been able to see the Dark Mark embellished on the tattered robes of the Dementors.

Dumbledore stepped out of the fireplace when the lunch dishes were being cleared. Everyone drifted back into the dining room to hear the news, but a message dropped out of the Floo right after he did. Because the Order was hidden, only certain owls were able to deliver to the house. The Weasleys had a forwarding system that allowed them to collect the mail delivered to their real home.

Mr. Weasley picked up the letter, frowning at the sender, and he ripped it open. He paled and Mrs. Weasley immediately crossed over to read it over his shoulder. She paled just as rapidly.

The end of the letter seemed to encourage them, and it was easy to hypothesize what must have happened. Sure enough, Mr. Weasley motioned his children closer.

"We've received a letter from St. Mungos. Percy was hospitalized after the Dementor attack. He's fine, but he'll stay under supervision for the rest of the day."

"What happened?" asked Charlie.

Mr. Weasley shrugged. "Several people collapsed during the attack. The Aurors think that it must be a new sort of attack, and that Dementors are focusing their presence on one person at a time with a debilitating effect. The hospital says everyone is recovering slowly, but with no long term effects."

"So he's fine," said Fred.

"What's the big deal?" asked George.

Mr. Weasley looked over to his wife who spoke up.

"I'm going to see him," she said. "And your father is as well. We would like all of you to come with us."

Fred and George took on identical looks of distaste.

"I'll go," said Charlie.

"Was he asking for us?" asked Fred.

"Well, no," said Arthur.

"So why are we going?" asked George.

"He's your brother," said Mrs. Weasley. "He shouldn't have to ask."

"It didn't sound like he wanted to be our brother the last family get together we had," Ron muttered.

"And we are going to show him that family is more important to us than politics," said Mrs. Weasley firmly.

"Even when he's siding with a Death Eater?" asked Ron.

"But Percy is not a Death Eater," said Mrs. Weasley.

"Might as well be one," Fred whispered to George, but loudly.

"Fred!" exclaimed Mrs. Weasley.

"Boys," said Mr. Weasley. "It's the holiday season. You don't have to debate politics with him, or even talk to him, but your mother wants you to see him, so I don't want any complaining, is that understood?"

A few disgruntled nods.

"He hasn't seen Lukas yet," said Bill, burping Lukas over his shoulder. "I bet he'll like seeing his nephew." Lukas spat up half of the bottle of milk he had just gulped down.

Draco saw Ginny to the door about twenty minutes later. Mr. Weasley had called a magical taxi, but Fred and George were causing a bit of a hold up.

"You alright with seeing Percy?" he asked, helping her into her coat.

"I guess," said Ginny. "I mean, he is a prat most of the time, but I don't think…I think maybe things went a little far the last time he talked with mum and dad."

Draco opened the door for her when the taxi honked its horn. Fred and George were still finding their shoes in their room, or so they said. They were obviously dragging their feet in the hopes their parents would leave without them.

Ginny explained further as she skipped down the front steps. Draco followed her to the curb, the bitter wind whipping through his thin button-up shirt and causing him to shiver.

"Mum's the one with the temper, but Dad holds a grudge like a hippogriff. And politics are important to him. And Percy always saw more shades of grey than he did. And then there was the whole Dumbledore debate."

Draco nodded. He had surmised as much from his brief meeting with Percy.

"Anyway," said Ginny, "it made a lot of things strained, even when he had moved out. Whenever he used to visit, Fred and George would do everything to get under his skin, they picked on him even when they were younger, and Ron would ignore him because Percy's bosses haven't always said the nicest things about Harry. He eventually stopped coming by altogether."

"How long has it been since you've seen him?" asked Draco.

"Over a year," said Ginny. "Last year he was on call for the Minister and couldn't make it to Christmas. He sent presents though, but this year, nothing so much as a card."

She let out a sigh and ran a hand through her hair which was getting whipped about her face by the wind. Her cheeks were pink from the wind, and she looked incredible, even with a worried frown, but she shivered and so Draco pulled open the car door for her.

"Good luck," he said.

She kissed him on the cheek. "Get inside before you catch a cold."

He smirked and leaned in for a real kiss. She was becoming more addictive than a dose of Angel Flight, but she was infinitely better for him. He just didn't know how good he was for her.

"Oi! I'm right here!" said Ron from the car.

Draco pulled away, because not only was Ron there, but her parents as well.

"See you soon," he said.

He passed Fred and George on his way in and found Harry pulling on his shoes.

"Me and Sirius are picking up Hermione from the station," he said. "Wanna come?"

"There are things more painful," Draco allowed, "but that doesn't mean I'd purposely subject myself to them."

He walked by to his study.

"There are people more unfriendly," Harry called after him, "but all of them are in St. Mungo's for spell damage."

Draco half-turned. "A witty rejoinder after only seven seconds. You're improving Potter."

"All thanks to you," said Harry.

Draco inclined his head and entered his study. He had hoped to have some time to himself so he could create a knife like Salazar's without interruptions or questions. Now was perfect.

He had gone to a non-magical antique weapon store right after his study session in Dumbledore's office and picked up a blade similar to Salazar's just for this opportunity. The knife was approximately the same size, and far more decorous and expensive than he actually needed, but he thought it was fitting. The blade was decorated with engraved flames, and the cross guard was a dragon's head. The hilt was the thin body, the perfect width for his grip, and the pommel was the dragon's tail. The accents were genuine ruby.

The knife had been made in the sixteenth century for a Muggle lord Draco was not familiar with, but then again, non-magical history had never been a strong suit of his, not unless the history directly affected the wizarding world. He would have to read up on the subject when he had spare time, which meant he would get to it when he was fifty-three, with the rate his projects were going.

Draco laid the knife on the table and took out his notes and the journal Harry had given him. It really was fortunate that Harry and Hermione had rigged the journal to 'speak' the Parseltongue language when he selected a word.

Next he got a small bowl and rolled up his right sleeve. Using the dragon knife, he made a quick, shallow cut on his wrist and held the bleeding wound over the bowl. He didn't need a lot of blood, just enough to cover the blade so he could begin warding the weapon. This sort of 'grey' magic always involved blood.

When he had enough, he cast a quick charm to stop the bleeding, and then used a handkerchief to spread his blood liberally over the blade. When the polished surface was stained red, he opened the journal and pointed his wand at the first word of the spells he needed. The recorded snake hisses filled the air with each motion of his wand.

The first was a sustaining spell, to insure the knife's upkeep and so the blade would never become dull. The next was a bonding spell, which included several ownership rites. Salazar's knife was his by default. Once the Founder had passed, the knife would need a new master. There may had been several since Slytherin, but when it fell into the Dark Lord's hand, it was once again without ownership. Draco's blood had been the first to cover the blade, but he still wanted his own, one that he had created himself.

He added an invisibility spell, which also involved some special displacement charms which would prevent it from being found by touch. Several other wards were put in place, ones that would allow him to locate the knife with a spell, or call it to his person, and others that enabled the knife to be used for different purposes, to break through barriers, to puncture through even the strongest of metals, and, like Salazar's knife, for torture.

Just hearing the Parseltongue words spoken, and holding the finished knife in his hand, made the scar on his left arm throb in memory. He was quick to put the blade down as soon as the spells were completely, and his right hand grasped his left arm. He rubbed at the scar, hoping to remove the hollow ache, but the oddly cold pain persisted.

It was only natural for his arm to hurt. Even with magical spells and potions, it was a serious injury and only a month old. Still, the ache unnerved him. He put both knives away and, feeling the need to distance himself further, he took one of the books he had received as a Christmas gift and left to the living room. He sat down by the fire, leaning against an armchair, and began to read.

He had spent, at most, half an hour on the knife, and he only managed to read the first chapter of the book before the front door opened and Sirius, Harry, and Hermione walked in. They were talking, and laughing, and then the fireplace flared and the Weasley family appeared, one by one. They were much more subdued, and Fred and George were muttering to each other and immediately Apparated off to their shop.

"Everything okay?" Sirius asked.

"Just fine," said Mrs. Weasley, forcing a smile. "Hermione, how are you dear? You must be exhausted after such a trip. Come sit down and I'll make you a cup of tea. Are you hungry? I can whip you up some lunch."

"Oh, no," said Hermione. "I'm-," she stopped because Ron stepped on her foot. "Some tea would be lovely," she amended, and Mrs. Weasley rushed off to the kitchen to busy herself.

Draco looked to Bill, noting the tightness around his mouth and the way he was holding Lukas close, running a comforting hand over the baby's back when Bill looked like he needed the comfort.

"Fleur's still at her office," said Bill to his father. "I told her I would bring Lukas by."

Arthur nodded and then Bill turned to Draco. He gave a quick upturn of the lips at Draco's raised eyebrow.

Draco looked to Ginny next. She was sitting by Hermione now, talking to the other girl, but she didn't look quite as excited as she had been that morning, when she had informed Draco that having Hermione around was a necessity for staying sane in a house full of teenaged boys.

As Draco watched, Ginny smiled and then got up.

"I'm going to run up and put a jumper on," she said. She walked by Draco, making eye contact for a split second before she reached the stairs and lightly ran up the steps. Draco glanced to Bill who jerked his head up. Draco took the hint and followed his girlfriend.

Ginny was in her room. The door wasn't shut all the way, and he could see her lying on her bed, one hand in her hair. He knocked.

She started a bit, and looked over to see him. He came in, the door flying open and plastering itself to the other wall. Draco waved his wand, nullifying the spell, and shut the door silently. Ginny sat up and swung her legs over the side of the bed.

Draco thought he should say something, and he ran through a few questions or platitudes in his head, but all of them seemed to be somehow inadequate. He rocked back on his heels in a rare moment of uncertainty.

"I'm sorry," he decided on.

"For what?" asked Ginny.

Draco shrugged a shoulder. "That it didn't go well."

"It's not your fault."

Well, he could have told her that Percy was working with a top secret Ministry team and fighting the same war she was, but couldn't tell his family for protection and security reasons, but he didn't. It would risk too much, and it wasn't his place.

"I'm sorry you're hurt," he said.

She gave a sad smile. "I'll be okay," she said. She let out a breath and stood up. "I should get back down," she said, and started to walk past. He could see that she wasn't okay, not right now. Her shoulders were hunched, just slightly, like she was trying to prepare herself for injury, and she was tensed. She obviously didn't want to talk though. That was okay; Draco wasn't the best of conversationalists in times of emotional pain.

He reached out, gently grabbing her hand and stopping her. He wasn't quite sure what to do next, but afraid he would over think it, he did what felt right. He gave her hand a tug and she stepped forward. She raised her arms to wrap around his neck and his arms went naturally around her waist. She rested her head on his shoulder and he could feel the ghost of breath as she sighed.

She didn't cry. Percy's 'betrayal' of the family was an old wound, but it appeared today had caused old memories and hurt to resurface.

He rubbed her back and they stood in silence for a few moments. She sighed again.

"This is nice," she mumbled into his shoulder. She took a breath in. "And you smell nice too."

Draco's lips quirked at that. Ginny pulled back and smiled. She still looked sad, and a bit resigned, but calmer, determined.

"Thank you," she said.

While Ginny seemed to regain her kilter in an hour or so, the dynamic of the Weasley family was dampened. By that evening, the unpleasantness of the meeting with Percy seemed to be pushed aside, but a new tension emerged with the media's portrayal of Osmond Tierney, hero of the hour.

Dumbledore called an Order meeting after dinner, and once again, Mrs. Weasley made a dessert to keep mouths full. It didn't help when the Order learned that Snape had been aware of the dealings with the Dementors for several weeks now.

"You what?" Mrs. Weasley demanded sharply.

"I was informed by the Dark Lord that negotiations with the Dementors had begun, and that he was helping them develop a new form of attack," said the Potions Master.

"You knew that there was going to be a Dementor attack and did nothing?" asked Mr. Weasley.

"Of course not," said Severus. "By the information, I suspected there would be a Dementor attack and did nothing."

"Which is not true," said Dumbledore. "He told me, but together we decided that it would be best not to act on this information. It was apparent, by the information he was able to retrieve, that the Dementors' new defense was not fatal, and that Tierney would be playing a role in the battle as well. In order to be elected, Tierney would have to look a hero, and so we suspected there would be no casualties. We cannot ambush every plan of which Severus bravely informs us. He would clearly be spotted as a spy then."

"But this is clearly a moment to act on the information," said Mr. Weasley. "If Osmond Tierney gets into office, it would give Voldemort the freedom he needs to gather more supporters and to eliminate those who would be our greatest defense against him."

"It would be hard to prove that Osmond Tierney was in league with Voldemort during this attack. I'm afraid there is not much we can do, legally, to prevent Tierney's election," Dumbledore countered. "Of course, Voldemort must know that we have members on the Auror task force, and so we can be privy of any information that comes to them, but I doubt there will be enough evidence to point to a Tierney/Death Eater alliance."

It was a dismal fact, but true. Draco really would have to check in with Percy to see if the Civis Arma had any information, but not just yet. He wanted to look over the Auror report first.

The election was to be held the next day, on New Years Eve, or rather, that's when the ballots would be cast. At midnight, the counting would begin, and shortly after (perhaps ten minutes) the winning candidate would be informed. Then the new Minister would meet with the staff and Heads of Departments, and that morning, around eight or nine, give an acceptance speech.

Right now, it was all out of his hands, and because there wasn't anything he could do, Draco didn't think on the election except to guess the number of votes for each nominee.

He pushed all of his projects and plans out of his head when he took Ginny out on New Year's Eve. It was becoming easier to do around her, which was slight terrifying when he let himself think about it. She wasn't helping any, not looking like that.

She had her hair down today, falling in gorgeous curls to the middle of her back. Her dress was copper-colored and shimmery, and it played a perfect complement to her complexion and eyes.

Their outfits didn't match at all. She was a vision in vibrant jewel tones, the copper dress, jasper eyes, ivory skin, and in the dim candlelight, her hair shone deep ruby with sparks of gold. Draco was a study of monochrome, black trousers, white oxford, grey waistcoat and eyes. Their outfits very nearly clashed, when usually the girls he was with wanted to proclaim their conquest to the world by following similar color schemes. Ginny wore what she liked, and she didn't even ask to know what he was wearing.

Draco had taken her to Stella's, a small, but elegant, Italian restaurant. It was unpopular among the flashy elitists, who lived to display their wealth to the world, because while expensive, Stella's was still affordable to the middle class on special occasions. Ginny appeared much more comfortable here than when she had joined him at the Triad. Part of that must have been because of Lucius, but he knew some of it was because of the opulence of the Triad and its patrons.

The guests at Stella's right now seemed to be couples celebrating the New Year. A few gifts were given, and a few tears shed, but there were no shouted declarations of love or loud toasts. The conversations were quite, the room was sedate, the atmosphere was calm and intimate.

Only one table in the far corner seemed to be different. It was occupied by a dark haired man in a conservative suit and a blonde woman in a simple black dress. They were hardly making eye contact and their postures were stiff. Draco wondered if they had been set up on a blind date.

"You know," said Ginny, drawing his attention back to their own table, "if you're going to make it a habit of taking me out to the really expensive restaurants, I'm going to have to take a course in Italian, and maybe French for good measure." She put her menu down, unable to read the meal descriptions.

"I could just teach you a few good translating charms," Draco offered.

"Well, until I'm allowed to use them, how about you tell me what I'm going to like?"

"So I'm a mind-reader as well, now?" asked Draco.

"Genius, mindreader, it's all the same," said Ginny.

Draco quirked his lips and explained a few dishes he thought she might enjoy. He would never dare order for her; he doubted she would let him.

Service was prompt, but it still took half an hour for their meal to arrive. At Stella's no shortcuts were taken to make a marvelous meal.

"It's beautiful here," said Ginny, after they gave their order.

"One of my favorites," said Draco.

"I bet you took a lot of girls here," she teased.

"Not here," said Draco. "It's too nondescript for their tastes."

"Nondescript has its uses," said Ginny. "I can't imagine having a conversation of any worth while half of the world listens in."

"There was no conversation with them," said Draco.

Ginny laughed a little, but then she grew serious. She took a sip of her water. Her parents had let her go out tonight with him under the stipulations that none of them would drink. Draco had given his word easily. He had never been much of a social drinker, and with Ginny there was no need to drink. She was beautiful and smart and funny. She never bored him, but right now, Draco almost wished she would. He knew where she would take this next, and she had a right to do so, but all the same…

"How many other girls were there?" she asked, setting her glass down gently.

She was direct, forward. She also looked prepared, ready to hear the worst.

"How many girls did I date, or how many did I have sex with?" asked Draco. If she wasn't going to waste words, he was either.

"How many girls did you sleep with?" she rephrased. Apparently she was prudish enough not to use the word 'sex'. Or maybe she was just averse to it in public.

"Would you be more shocked if I said fifteen or five?" Draco asked.

"Draco, not right now."

"I just want to know what you think of me," he said with a shrug.

"But I don't want to think of you as anything until I know the number. Don't make me prejudge you just so you can get offended when I believe the worst because of your own representation."

Draco nodded. "Four," he said.

She was surprised. "Four," she repeated.

"Pansy Parkinson, off and on since I was fifteen. Katerina Ancorff, one night, spring fifth year. Allete Pierpont, one week, summer before sixth year. Therese Lawrence, sixth year, after the Yule ball."

"How long since…?"

"Pansy. You were there after."

"Do you like her?"

"Yes."

"Would you have sex with her again?"

"Not when I'm seeing you."

"Do you mean that in all honesty?"

"Lucius has never taken on a mistress, not even when Narcissa broke her vows."

"And you're the same."

"Completely."

Ginny nodded. "Thank you."

"Is that it?" Draco asked in surprise.

"Well, yeah. I mean, there'd be more questions if you said fifteen, like why can't you keep it in your pants, but four is…,"

"I'm seventeen," said Draco. "If I was twenty, I could understand the concern."

"From the rumors I should have thought you'd bedded the entire Slytherin population, and half of the Ravenclaws."

"Not bedded. Snogged, maybe, with a lot of groping, but only the pretty older ones."

"Have all of them been older than you?"

"Yes."

"Which one did you like the best?"

Draco frowned. "Most girls don't want to hear about past experiences."

"Call me abnormal. Besides, I'm the only girl you've actually talked to, so I'm feeling rather secure."

"You don't get jealous easily, do you?"

"Not really. I mean, if Pansy walked up to you right now and kissed you, I'd be angry, but jealous, not so much."

It was surprising. The Dark Lord was extremely possessive. He would sooner see a follower dead than turned, sooner destroy a fort than let it fall. If it was not his, it would not belong to anyone. Ginny, though, Ginny was far too empathetic to fly into a jealous rage. She would be hurt, but she would seek to understand before she condemned.

"So," said Ginny. "Who did you like best?"

"Allete Pierpont. Short, blonde, curvy. Sweet girl, art student." And, now that he thought about it, "She's a lot like you, just quieter. Smoker, though."

"Flattered," said Ginny.

"And you?" asked Draco. "Any exes I should be worried about?" Maybe her school-long crush on Harry Potter?

"No," said Ginny. "I like hanging around guys. I think I get along with them better, and it's led to a lot of dates, but nothing serious. Dean Thomas was my longest relationship, three months."

"What about Potter?" He didn't want to ask, but he had to know.

"My first crush," said Ginny. "I think he's more of a brother now. I couldn't see myself falling in love with him."

Draco couldn't see it as well, but he wanted to know that she saw it. People sometimes were blinded when it came to matters of emotion. He wanted to know that she wasn't going to pursue him.

The rest of their conversation was decidedly more pleasant, and he was actually glad she had asked. He didn't want her to be too afraid to ask, or suspect the worst. Emotional unavailability had kept him from doing more than fooling around with the girls who would occasionally attach themselves to his side, and while four may have been more than the average teenage boy, it was nowhere near the numbers Draco had heard connected to his name.

By dessert, any amount of discomfort he felt admitting his sexual history to Ginny, whom he already knew had nothing more than a few heated make-out sessions with Dean (he did indeed keep up with school gossip), had dissipated.

They took the Floo to the Symphony, arriving fifteen minutes before the start of the concert. It was a surprise to him that the entire auditorium was full. He felt sure that a good number of people would be absent, because of the Minister's death and the recent attack. It was, however, New Years Eve, and so perhaps the holiday gave people an excuse to forget about their troubles for awhile.

Draco had reserved a box seat. With the way the auditorium was built, and the charms around incorporated into the building, there wasn't any need to fear an echo in any seat of the house, and he wasn't in the mood to sit right next to another person and have his conversation overheard.

"It's beautiful in here," said Ginny, peering out over the banister on their tiny balcony. "And look at all the people. Oh, that's Sienna Starlight, and there's Don Marlow. And the entire band of Sphinx."

It was an odd collection of musicians that she pointed out. Sienna Starlight was a pop singer, Don Marlow was a jazz musician, and Sphinx was a heavy metal band. He had no doubt that with her family she was introduced to many genres of music.

"All three nominees for Minister are here," she reported. "And a whole lot of reporters, and-," she cut off, glimpsing someone that made her pull back from the railing.

Draco peered forward, even though Ginny grabbed his arm. "It's nothing," she said.

But Draco had already spotted the long, white-blond hair. Lucius Malfoy was speaking to a few members of the French delegation towards the back of the auditorium. Draco glanced over towards the stage and saw that a choice seat, three rows back and next to the aisle, was open. The others occupying that row were all business associates of his father.

He felt relieved. This must simply be a coincidence then. Lucius was out with his business friends, no doubt gleaning information on which companies he should drop and which ones he should invest in just a bit more. He glanced back to his father and then swore in his head.

Lucius was speaking with a man with dark hair, dressed unobtrusively in a conservative suit. Draco recognized him from the restaurant.

The man in black nodded his head and slipped out of the auditorium. Draco pulled back before Lucius could catch his gaze.

"You okay?" asked Ginny.

"The man he was just speaking to," said Draco. "He was at Stella's as well."

Ginny frowned. "Are you sure?"

"Positive." He looked over to see that she looked stricken, so he leaned forward and touched her hand.

"He's not going to do anything here," he reassured her. "In fact, I don't think he's going to do anything at all. He's just keeping tabs, and if I know that he is, all the better for him. It's a power play."

"You don't think…you don't think he's planning something, do you?" asked Ginny.

Draco shook his head. His father had just murdered the Minister of Magic, and Lucius always had an odd sort of business plan. Horrible acts were usually followed by deeds that could almost be labeled as charity.

"Maybe if I started to defame the Malfoy name," he said. "Right now, he just wants to see what I'm doing."

"And who you're doing?" Ginny asked, affecting a mock-seductive look. Her blunt word choice and lascivious glance startled a smile out of him.

"You know, I did promise your parents that I would be a perfect gentleman," said Draco.

"Did you really?"

"Well, the threat if I didn't was largely unspoken, but no less terrifying."

Ginny smiled. "My parents aren't terrifying."

Draco raised an eyebrow.

"Maybe sometimes," she allowed.

The lights dimmed and, on stage behind the curtain, the sound of an orchestra tuning became apparent.

They both turned towards the stage.

o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

Percy woke up to the quiet, muffled sounds of footsteps and a low, almost soothing humming. He opened his eyes, not quite surprised to see that he was in a hospital bed because the last thing he remembered was seeing a dementor staring (or facing, since he couldn't see any eyes) right at him. There had been a freezing hand that entered his mind, and pain, and a nightmare. He saw his family die. They died hating him, cursing him. And then there had only been the cold that froze him from the inside out.

The humming was coming from the machine behind him on the wall, monitoring his magical signature, which was the surest indicator of any health troubles. Percy pushed himself up a little ways and looked about him.

He was in a private room, which again, wasn't really a surprise. He was the Assistant to the Minister after all, and Assistants weren't easily replaced, especially on short notice. He had never been in a private hospital room before though, and it was actually, dare he think it, pleasant. The walls were a soft yellow and there was actually carpet on the floor. It was a stiff, deep blue carpet that was obviously spelled to be stain resistant, but it was carpet none-the-less. There was a window on the left, charmed with a sunny, picturesque view, and the door across from him was closed and did a fairly good job of keeping the other hospital sounds down to a whisper.

The door opened as he was studying it, and a Healer wheeled in a cart.

"Been waiting for you to wake up, Assistant," she said. "How are you feeling?"

"Bit groggy," said Percy. "Headache."

"How bad?"

"Manageable."

"Pounding, throbbing, shooting pains?"

"Pounding."

"I've just the thing."

He was handed a vial of blue potion, which he downed, and almost immediately the pain lessened.

"Are you feeling cold?"

"A little chilled." Actually, he felt down-right cold. His fingers felt stiff and it was hard to bend them, and he was sure his feet were solid bricks of ice.

The Healer checked the warmth spell charm posted on the door.

"It's already well above room temperature in here," she said. "In fact, normally in this weather I'd been at the coast swimming."

"You're kidding," said Percy. He could distinctly feel a cool draft on his face and hands and he could feel the cold air seep through the blankets.

"Afraid not, but it seems to be a common complaint from the other patients as well."

"How many were affected?"

"Twenty-six counting you. Everyone's recovering fine though. Here."

The Healer pulled another blanket from a cabinet in the corner and draped it over his legs. Percy pulled it up to mid-chest. The Healer then poured a cup of hot chocolate from a carafe on the cart and handed that over as well.

"Sip that, and you'll start getting warmed up in no time."

Percy obliged. The drink was at a perfect temperature and was the richest chocolate he had ever tasted. It was soothing, and he tuned out the Healer's bustling as she checked his vital signs on the monitor, took his temperature, and jotted down notes on a clipboard.

"Are you feeling up to a visitor?" the Healer asked.

Percy looked up from his cup and nodded.

"I'll go get him," she said and quickly exited the room. Percy tried to sit up further, and wondered if he looked as cold and miserable as he looked. From the expression on John Kelly's face, he did.

The Healer poured him another cup of hot chocolate and then respectfully left the room. Percy let John pull over a chair and then activate a silence ward around the room before he spoke.

"What happened?"

He remembered the debate, of course, but the attack was mostly hazy. He couldn't help but think there was something he should remember. Something that had caught his attention, made him…made him what? Concerned? Relieved? He couldn't remember and his head hurt when he tried to press any further.

"Well, you were there for the Dementors. Turns out over half of them attacked, wearing the Dark Mark on their robes, and we don't know where they are now," said John grimly.

"Shit," said Percy.

"They took out nearly thirty people with their focused attacks, but they never stooped in for the Kiss. After you went down, Osmond Tierney let loose a Patronus the size of a dragon. A griffin. The Dementors fled, the Aurors arrived, and the media's been in a frenzy ever since."

Percy blinked. "Tierney?" he asked.

John nodded. "The Dementor assault was obviously planned by the Death Eaters."

"And Tierney is unstable, we know that. I could think of several reasons why a certain madman would want Tierney in office. With Tierney playing the hero, he just won the election."

"I'm looking over the Auror report," said John. "If there's any way to get him out of office, I'll find it, but linking him to this fiasco is going to be close to impossible."

"And Tierney in office means that he's going to find some way to endanger a lot of people," said Percy. "It will be harder to counter his actions."

"And now we'll have to start skimming for our budget again."

"Shit, the budget," said Percy, reaching up to pinch the bridge of his nose. "Tierney was a genius in finance. I'll have to go through and make sure he can't spot any of the differences."

John made a commiserating face, and stood. "I'm needed back at the Cabinet, but you rest up. I'll tell everyone else that you're doing okay. They'd like to visit themselves, but…,"

"But it's better if we don't associate in public," said Percy. "I know. Could you do me a favor, though?"

"Anything," said John.

"I need my briefcase."

"I think you need some sleep," said John.

"I was behind on work before the attack," said Percy. "And now I'll need to release a statement to the press saying that Tierney's actions, while commendable, will not be playing a part in the election. I'll also have to tighten security on the acceptance speech, and redo a certain budget. Not to mention liaise with the Aurors and get their official report before they release it."

"I still think you need to rest," said John. "Overworking yourself isn't going to help anyone."

"I'm in bed, John, and drinking hot chocolate. Believe me, I would love to get my work done here, where I won't be interrupted."

"Alright. I'll send it over."

"Thanks."

"Get better."

John left and Percy closed his eyes. He had learned never to waste the time he could use to sleep. As Assistant, he was never quite sure when he would next get a full night of sleep.

A trainee brought in his work half an hour later. Percy thanked him, was given another mug of hot chocolate, because he still wasn't getting any warmer, and grabbed his glasses from the bedside table.

He was farsighted, and only needed the glasses to see fine print, so they were charmed to only trigger when he read or wrote. He wore them nearly constantly because he felt his red hair was a bit too ridiculous, and the glasses gave him a more scholarly look.

The quiet of the hospital was extremely conducive to getting his paper work done. He was nearly done with sending letters to all of the Governors reminding them that Tierney's actions were not to count for him in the election, a standard Ministry disclaimer, when there was a knock on the door.

"Come in," said Percy, not looking up from his papers. He could see the same trainee in his peripheral vision. "Yes?" Percy asked.

"You have a few more visitors," the medical student said. "Are you feeling up to a visit?"

Percy lowered the papers, frowning. Visitors? Shouldn't they know it could be incriminating to visit?

"Send them in," he said.

The trainee stepped aside, and then his mother was stepping through the doorway. Percy stared, but then she was exclaiming his name and rushing over to his side.

"Percy, just look at you! What on earth happened?" She lay a blessedly warm hand on his forehead. "Dear Merlin, you're positively half-frozen! Where are the Healers? You shouldn't be this cold still. Are you feeling alright? How long are you staying? We were told you were fine, but my goodness, just look at you! Paler than a ghost, you are!"

Percy only half-listened to her. He was too busy staring at the rest of his family. His father was there, with that stern expression on his face, the one he wore whenever he was particularly troubled. Bill was holding a baby, it must be his son, and was forcing a small smile in his direction. Fred and George were glaring. Ron was shifting back and forth on his feet, staring at the ground, and Ginny was hanging in the back. Charlie stepped forward with an affable smile.

"How you feeling, Percy?" he asked, stopping their mother's fussing with that one question.

Percy looked at all of them. They seemed so much older since he had seen them. Even little Ginny, who was looking far too pretty and mature for a sixteen year old. Percy needed to have a new talk with Draco about this whole dating thing.

"I'm okay," he said.

There was silence. It was an uncomfortable, awkward silence.

Percy had bought Christmas presents for his family. He had carefully selected the presents, money not being a problem as he was paid very well, but after wrapping the gifts, he was suddenly afraid that they were inappropriate.

His father had a better job now, but nowhere near his own salary, and it was obvious that the gifts were costly. Would his family read that as an insult? Would they think he was rubbing his job in their faces?

Of course, if he got them cheaper presents then that would say that he didn't care about them.

He was the only one in the Civis Arma with a lot of family nearby, and there was some thought that families could be potential targets, but their secrecy hadn't been compromised just yet, and his family did live in a secure location. Now, with the threat of Tierney becoming Minister, he didn't know if mending the fences was the best idea. Tierney was a paranoid madman. He wouldn't shy away from targeting families if he suspected Percy of plotting against him.

"Did we interrupt your work?" Charlie asked, breaking the silence, despite the fact he was the only one who didn't look uncomfortable.

Percy looked down at the papers strewn across the covers and bedside table.

"Oh, no," he said.

There was another pause.

"Are you liking your job?" asked Charlie.

Percy nodded. "Definitely. It's a lot of work, and a lot of responsibility, but it's rewarding too."

"Rewarding when no one remembers your name?" Fred muttered to George.

Percy shot him a look. They had always found his government career laughable.

"You must have been quite busy with recent activities," said his dad, speaking up for the first time.

Percy nodded. "Minister Fudge was a great man, and his death caused a lot of upheaval, overseas as well as in England. We've been fielding a lot of sympathy calls, but with them comes a lot of pressure to deal with certain threats in our country. I've been in charge of replying while the board waits to elect a Minister."

"You've been speaking with foreign Ministers?" asked his mother, sounding impressed and surprised.

"If the Minister ever has to leave a conference for an emergency elsewhere, it's my job to either finish the meeting or close it and find an easy time to reconvene."

"Oh," said Molly delightedly. "Boys, did you hear that? Your brother has led meetings in place of the Minister!"

Maybe he shouldn't have said that. It sounded like he was bragging now, but he hadn't been able to tell anyone what he was doing for so long. He had no one to celebrate his successes with. The first time he had completed a trade meeting between the French and German Ministers, he had gone back to his flat and opened a bottle of wine by himself.

Fred and George rolled their eyes; Charlie smiled encouragingly.

"And what about Tierney?" asked his father. "What if he became Minister? You wouldn't hold meetings for him, would you?"

"I'm Assistant to the Minister," said Percy. "That is any Minister who is placed in command by the law, regardless of whether or not my family approves of him."

Alright, maybe that had come out a little harshly.

"Even when Tierney is advocating policies that would tear this country apart?" his father challenged. "I've seen his plans, plans that he swears will help this nation, but will tear this country apart and lead to the deaths of innocent civilians."

"This isn't a dictatorship," said Percy. "He cannot pass a law without the approval of the legislators, and if they do pass it, it means they see a problem that they want to fix."

"The problem they see is that people are speaking out against the Ministry who is doing nothing to protect the people because it would mean admitting their failure to warn them when Voldemort returned!"

"The Ministry had no hard evidence at that time that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had arisen. You can't expect them to release a public statement that would spark mass hysteria on the word of a few school children."

"Albus Dumbledore spoke in Harry's defense."

And here the old argument came up.

"Contrary to your popular belief," said Percy, "Albus Dumbledore has his limits, and running the Ministry is not on his list of talents. He is very suited to his school and I would suggest that he stay there instead of running a vigilante organization and subjecting his naïve aspirations on the country."

"Percy, that is quite enough," said his mother sharply. "Albus Dumbledore has been nothing but kind and generous to our family and you owe him your gratitude."

"I owe him?" Percy demanded. "As a student I owed him the respect of a student, but I am no longer a child, and I can see how his good intentions have led so many people into a battle they should not be fighting."

"Not be fighting?" his father all but yelled.

An unfortunate choice of words, and it was too late to stop him now. Arthur Weasley rarely lost his temper, and when he did, it was because of three things. One, Lucius Malfoy. Two, expressions of ingratitude. Three, political beliefs of injustice. Percy, with that statement, had violated the second two. He had only meant to violate the second.

"I only meant-," he started, but his father was already speaking, rapidly, fluidly, and quietly.

"Albus Dumbledore is the only man able to stand against Voldemort. He was the only man who had the courage and ability to counter the Death Eaters during the first war. It was by his example that others joined his cause, and it is by his example that we join him again. Those who stand by and ridicule him now are men who are unable to think of any but their own comfort and gain. They run because they have no desire to see a better world because they are well enough in this one. They ignore the inhumanity because they are no longer human themselves, they are animals, and I regret to say that my son is looking more and more like them every day."

Percy stared at his father in shock, but his father gaze was unmoving. Regretful, yes, but unmoving. He looked to his mother to see that she had that same, sorrowful look on her face.

"Way to go, dad," said Fred quietly, and from George's nod, his twin had said it all.

Bill had to step back, because Lukas was fussing, and Ron was standing next to Ginny who looked like she wanted to cry.

"Not everyone who doesn't agree with you is in the wrong," said Percy.

"We raised you better than this," said his father.

"You raised me better?" Percy asked. "So you have all the answers, is it? I can't deviate from your politics because you are right one hundred percent of the time? The arrogance on you is astounding!"

"Percy!" exclaimed his mother.

"I never said that injustice shouldn't be checked. I objected to the way the battle was fought. The Ministry-,"

"Since when has the Ministry ever responded to the threat of Voldemort?"

"You can't just abandon the government because your way is better, or will end the confrontation sooner. The government is in place to protect human lives."

"But it's not doing its job. And now Tierney will be elected, and then what? The government cannot be upheld when it endangers the citizens it is sworn to protect!"

"There is more to the government than the Minister. Why is my chosen career so much of a problem for you to handle?"

"Because you forget the morals your mother and I raised you with. You leave ethics at the door and play servant to men who have not done their sworn duty."

"Play servant? I am not the lowly hired help kept at the whim of the Minister. I am one of the most powerful men in the Ministry!" Percy couldn't help the last exclamation. Why couldn't they see all that he had done? Why did they continually choose to belittle his accomplishments simply because they did not agree with his political views?

"Power is nothing if you have lost yourself," said his father.

And it was all too much. Not two hours ago he had seen them dead in his dreams, cursing him, damning him. He was freezing, still recovering from the Dementors. He could feel his heart pounding with stress and anger, and instead of causing him to sweat, instead of getting heated, with every beat of his heart, it felt as if his blood was getting colder. It made him strike back. He was still a Weasley and he had his mother's temper.

"And how would you ever know a thing like that?" he asked cruelly. "Why is it, dad, that as soon as I begin rising in the Ministry, you start hounding me? Never a word of praise, never a congratulations. Are you upset that I can do what you never could? Hold a decent job and be able to care for myself?"

His mother gasped.

"That is quite enough," said Arthur quietly.

"No, it's not," said Percy. "All of you hated my career. You praised my good grades, and praised my high aspirations, but the moment I took my job, you only had criticisms and critiques. Are all of you jealous then?"

"You wish," said George. "You're a grade A prat."

"I don't even know why we came to visit," said Fred.

Why had they come to visit? Percy blinked, suddenly realizing that he had taken them off of his emergency contact list when the Civis Arma had started. He hadn't wanted any of them getting involved, and if he ended up in the hospital for whatever reason, conclusions could be drawn.

"Why did you visit then?" he asked. Most everyone in the Ministry knew he wasn't on speaking terms with his family, but maybe someone thought the feud was just a front. Maybe someone (Tierney) wanted to know if he was involved in the Order.

"Because the hospital owled us," said Molly. "We wanted to know if you were alright."

"Waste of an afternoon," said Ron.

"It is," Percy agreed. "I took all of you off of my emergency contact list. You must have received that owl by mistake."

His cold voice had them all staring. Fred and George swore and stalked out of the room. Ron followed, dragging Ginny with him. The twins' loud curses had set Lukas to sobbing and Bill excused himself. Percy dragged his gaze up to his parents.

"You have obviously chosen your path," said Mr. Weasley. "You must know that it is incompatible with my own. The rest of the family may visit you as they please." The unspoken 'but I never will' hung in the air. His father gave him one last look and then turned away.

"Percy, dear," said his mother, a tremor in her voice. "All you have to do is come back." She was pleading with him.

"It's obvious I'm not needed," said Percy.

She had tears in her eyes now, and she stepped up to kiss him on the cheek.

"I won't visit," she said, "I won't go against Arthur in this, but if you ever need anything, you can just owl."

"I've been on my own since Hogwarts. I'm sure I'll be fine."

She nodded and followed her husband out the door. Percy looked over to Charlie who was frowning, hands stuffed in his pockets.

"Charlie," he started, but then stopped because he wasn't sure how to finish.

"You must have known what you would do to them," said Charlie, no sign of reproach in his voice, just stating the fact.

"You have to know that I'm not completely wrong on this," said Percy.

"Everyone has some element of truth in their opinion."

"But I'm not turning into some bureaucrat only concerned with power and money. There are issues, I know that, I want to fix them."

"Then mum and dad will see that."

"You aren't going to talk to them?"

"I'm not going to argue someone else's opinion, Perce."

Charlie never did argue. Percy sighed and rubbed his eyes.

"Then just…just go with the rest of them."

Charlie nodded. "Feel better then." He handed over a package he must have been holding the entire time, but Percy hadn't noticed it. "Got you a Christmas present."

He tossed it onto the bed and Percy stared at the gift.

"I got you one too," he said quietly. "It's in my flat, in the closet. I was going to send them out, but…"

"You can give it to me another year," said Charlie. "When everything simmers down again."

Percy nodded. Charlie gave a small smile and left the room.

The present turned out to be an organizing portfolio. The folder was made of black leather, with a small, unobtrusive dragon clasp on the front which would only open for him, insuring confidentiality. There were pockets for schedules and full compartments for legal documents or trade plans. It was charmed to stay slim and lightweight. Charlie always gave dragon-themed presents, and this was the first one Percy might actually use in public.

He didn't get much work done that evening, the fight interfering with his concentration. It also seemed to interfere with his recovery because the Healer frowned when she took his temperature and turned the heat up in the room. They kept him overnight and into the late afternoon of the next day.

Percy didn't mind. He was given a sleep aid that night, and while he dreamed of the attack that night, it wasn't a nightmare; he was simply trying to remember. He still didn't remember in the morning, but he woke up refreshed and ready to push his personal emotions aside. He finished the budget that morning and then prepared for the inevitable, tyrannical reign of Osmond Tierney.

He was present at the casting of the ballots, which was held in the Governor's Hall, a grand room of tiered seating, individual desks of mahogany, and gold fountain pens and ink bottles. He knew, letters from the Ministry or no, Tierney's heroics had cinched him the victory.

The Ballots were cast precisely at 11:30 on New Year's Eve. The Governors wrote down the name they desired and placed it into the election box, a jade container carved with centaurs and stars and supposedly tamper proof. Percy didn't put too much stock in promises of security. Not after the Goblet of Fire. But Tierney didn't need to cheat now.

After all the Governors had put in their vote, Percy followed the Head Judge on the Wizengamot to the Juror's Department along with the Minister's Cabinet and the Chief Auror to count the ballots.

The ballots actually sorted themselves. All the Head Judge had to do was wait for the others to be seated around the table, have Percy officially note the attendance of all necessary persons and start taking the minutes, and open the box.

The ballots flew out into neatly organized piles. There were seventy Governors in total. Three piles formed on the table. Two small, one large. The piles then toppled into neat rows. There were five for Rawlings. Eleven for Gallup. Fifty-four were for Tierney.

Percy noted the win on the official paper.

"Osmond Tierney is the new Minister of the Magical Citizens and Territory of England," said the Head Judge.

"Observed and confirmed," the cabinet responded.

"I move to record Osmond Tierney as eighty-third Minister of the Magical Citizens and Territory of England," said Percy.

"As Head Judge of the Wizengamot, I have observed the vote and confirmed his victory. I second the motion."

"As the Chief Auror, sworn protector of the Magical Citizens of England and upholder of Ministry Law, I approve the motion to name Osmond Tierney as Minister."

"The record so reflects," said Percy, writing down Tierney's name on the chronicle of the election.

There was a moment of silence after his quill stopped moving, then the Head Judge clapped twice.

"That's that," he said. "Assistant, you are to inform Osmond Tierney on New Year's Day, 12:01, that he is the new Minister of England. If you'll then escort him up here, I'm sure he would like to meet the cabinet."

"My honor, sir," said Percy. He passed the paper over to be signed by the judge and the Auror and then slipped the page into an envelope and sealed it before sending it to be filed in Archives. It would be opened at eight o'clock that morning, when Tierney gave his acceptance speech to the media and spectators in the Atrium. Percy had been overseeing the set-up all evening.

At five of, he walked over to the private offices in the Judge's Corridor. When it struck twelve, he wished himself a happy New Year. He wondered if his family was having a big party. He fantasized about attending, or attending any party really. Maybe with Helena Greenwich. Now there was a real fantasy…He pulled himself out of his thoughts and checked the clock again. One past. He opened the door.

Osmond Tierney sat in the small office, his feet propped up on the desk. He was twirling a pen through his fingers. He was a tall man, distinguished. The hair at his temples had turned a steel grey while the rest remained jet black. His eyebrows were full, his jaw square. His eyes were dark blue, and right now they were smugly triumphant. He didn't look surprised to see Percy.

"Mr. Minister," said Percy. "Congratulations."

Tierney leapt to his feet, his lips twisting up. He crossed the room to shake Percy's hand. His grip was hard, nearly crushing. Percy smiled through it all.

"The cabinet is waiting to meet you upstairs," said Percy.

"Splendid, splendid," said Tierney, and then pushed ahead to lead the way himself. Percy followed, wondering what damage the new Minister could do within the first ten minutes of his appointment to office. He shouldn't have tempted Fate.

Tierney flung open the door, and only accepted the most perfunctory of congratulations before ordering them all to sit down.

"There will be time for celebrations later," he said. "Right now, I want to get straight to business and deal with something I know has been troubling us all."

The cabinet reluctantly sat down as Tierney stood at the head of the table. Percy sat on the first chair to the new Minister right, and he immediately wished he had more space. From this close, he didn't feel exactly safe.

"Minister Fudge was a great man," Tierney began. "It seems only fitting that my first act as Minister is to identify his murderer and bring him to justice."

Percy blinked, and then looked over to Jonathan Felix, but it was apparent that everyone in the cabinet was just as surprised and confused as he was. He looked back to Tierney who was resting his hands on the back of the chair he should have been sitting in. He was surveying their disbelieving faces with a satisfied smile.

"This is a time of war," said Tierney. "As Minister, that gives me the opportunity to turn to otherwise inaccessible sources of information. At this time, I would ask you to remain calm."

Percy's hand slid from the record and gripped his wand that was stashed in a belt-holster. Only important officials were allowed to carry them, and he could see John Kelly and Jonathan Felix were also freeing their wand hands. The rest of the eight member cabinet looked unnerved, and then Tierney set out a small, glass globe. It was a Portkey Activator.

There was a flash as the person was allowed through the wards on the Ministry. Percy gripped his wand, John Kelly and Samuel Tenny jumped to their feet, and someone else shouted in surprise and maybe a bit of fear.

"Good morning to you all," said Bellatrix Lestrange.

Behind her, Percy could see Osmond Tierney grinning malevolently at them all.

So, what do you think? I told you things were going to start heating up. And, because school is heating up as well, I'll only be updating every two weeks now as I'm swamped. Thanks for understanding. Please leave a review!





23. New Year's Accusation

Hi

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would not have to study for a GRE or a psych subject GRE, and the over three hundred dollars I am shelling out would not be so painful. Alas, the college life.

Author's Note: Yeah. I'm a week late. I really am shooting for two weeks, but I'm swamped this semester. As stated above, I've huge exams to study for, along with other insane senior classes, along with applications to fill out for grad school. I'm a bit stressed, you could say. I love writing as a stress reliever, but I've simply no time. Anyway, sorry I won't be replying to reviews, but thanks to everyone.

OoOoOoOoOo—OoOoOoOoOo—OoOoOoOoOo

The symphony was a huge hit. The orchestra first played the Magician's Symphony to rousing applause, and then there was an intermission. The Magician's Symphony wasn't very long, as there was only one movement, and so there really wasn't any need for a break, but it allowed for concessions to be sold and for the excitement to build. It also allowed the radio stations, who would be airing the premiere live, to get in a few advertisements. During the break, Draco ordered two glass of champagne, non-alcoholic, and together they toasted the evening.

They wandered around the building a bit, because the architecture was quite stunning, and then made it back to the box right as the lights were dimming again. Ginny reached over and squeezed Draco's hand as the conductor walked out once more to applause. Draco didn't let her take her hand back.

The Song of Seraph had been a simple concept when he first started it. He wanted to contrast deep, solid chords with faster, slightly discordant notes, but then he wasn't satisfied until he had been able to integrate the two seamlessly. He knew why Ginny would call it the Song of Seraph. It was a bit like a fire, slow and smoldering, before bursting forth in a glorious, triumphant blaze.

He had great respect for the conductor, Marcus Brady, who was not afraid to expand on the score. If he felt the pianissimo was too quiet for the way his musicians play, he changed it. If he wanted to add a retard on the end for more emphasis, he did. The man was a musical genius, and Draco was never afraid his music would be butchered.

The orchestra played it flawlessly, and when the final note ended with a timpani strike, there was a moment of silence. Then the audience erupted, lunging to their feet and applauding loud enough to rattle the chandeliers on the ceiling.

Draco stood too, cheering the orchestra. Ginny peered over the rail while she clapped and turned to Draco.

"I think you're missing out," she said, speaking close to his ear so he could hear her.

Draco smirked. "Do you want to me run on stage right now?" he asked. "Take a bow or two?"

Ginny shook her head. "Then I would have to share you." She tugged his shirt, tilting her head back for a kiss. Draco wondered if the acceleration of his heart, and the odd warmth in his chest, was anything akin to romance.

They stayed for a short while at the after party. Established composers enthused about the complexity of the piece, popular artists celebrated the emotion, and the rest of the audience described the chills the symphony gave them.

Draco didn't purposefully seek out any company, but a few men and women approached him, usually those who were important officials of the companies he invested in. They were sure to give their best wishes for the next year, and to heap compliments on Ginny.

She handled the attention quite well, shaking their hands firmly, accepting their praise with a simple 'thank you' and then allowing Draco to make what assurances he needed before ending the business talk as soon as possible and moving away.

Draco was also sure to keep an eye out for Lucius. He had no desire to see his father, and whenever a glimpse of pale hair and a cane was spotted, he noticed that Ginny tensed, her hand occasionally rising to her throat.

They were one of the first couples to leave, but the family was having a party back at the Order Headquarters, and Draco didn't think it was polite to monopolize Ginny's time on the holiday. They had only been dating a couple of weeks, and Draco was pretty sure that in normal relationships 'taking it slow' was a vital rule to follow.

The party was warming up when they Flooed back. Kingsley, Tonks, Lupin, and Dumbledore were present, with other Order members due to arrive at their leisure. Upon arrival, everyone burst into applause, having listened to the live broadcast on the radio.

"Absolutely beautiful," said Mrs. Weasley.

"Incredible," said Mr. Weasley.

"It was cool," said Ron, hands in his pockets and looking as if he wasn't quite thrilled.

Draco nodded his thanks anyway.

"Ah, here's our own Beethoven," said Fred, pushing forward.

"Our little Mozart," George agreed.

They both swept low bows and then Fred presented him with a large bouquet of roses. Draco couldn't refuse them, not when the flowers were practically shoved into his hands, but the expectant gleam in their eyes warned him not to do anything more than hold them by the crinkling tissue paper wrapping.

"How long have you been composing, Draco?" asked Dumbledore.

Draco shrugged. "A few years now." He glanced over and then shoved the flowers into Harry's hand. "Here, Potter." He turned back to Dumbledore, making sure to look like he was in the middle of an important conversation. "I didn't have the chance to really pursue music until a few years ago, because so many other things seemed to be more important. Dueling and potions, and such."

From the corner of his eye, he could see Harry still holding the bouquet, looking around for a place to put them. He leaned in to smell them, and then –

"A-CHUH!" Harry sneezed violently, almost coughing as well. Sparkling orange dust shot from his nose and everyone turned to watch. "A-chuh! A-a-cho! A-choo, a-chuh, a-chuh!"

The boy hero couldn't seem to stop sneezing. With each, a new color of dust flew from his nostrils.

"Excellent color scheme, George," said Fred.

"Why thank you, Fred. You were right about the snorgle powder. Quite the linger effect."

"Mm. Too bad Malfoy didn't smell the flowers."

They both looked over at Draco quite accusingly. Draco raised an eyebrow.

"I just wrote a symphony. How obtuse do you think I am?"

"Has a point, Fred," said George.

"I suppose," said Fred.

Harry finally stopped sneezing five minutes later, and them Mrs. Weasley made Fred and George clean up the pile of sparkling, multi-colored dust on the floor.

"It needs something more," Draco heard Fred whispering to George as they directed the powder into a dustpan.

"Not enough flash," George agreed.

Draco didn't get to overhear what ideas they had, because the fireplace flared and Pansy stepped out with a sing-song 'I'm here!' He was startled to see her in a pair of blue jeans. They were ridiculously tight, but her legs were completely covered. Her top was glittering and black and strapless, but it only showed a hint of cleavage. It was flowing as well, not painted on and it covered her entire stomach, falling a few inches past the top of her jeans. It nearly covered her arse, which was displayed very nicely in the jeans.

Draco blinked, and then watched her sashay over to Hermione, right past Charlie. The dragon-keeper watched her pose, obviously for his benefit, with a soft smile.

He raised his eyebrow. Not only was Charlie ignoring the most lewd behavior from Pansy, he must also be ignoring her immodest dress. He hadn't once seen Charlie staring at Pansy's legs, or nearly bare breasts, and he knew how that must frustrate Pansy. In fact, the few times he had seen the two together, he'd noticed how Charlie would pay less attention to the girl when she had less clothes on. Pansy was a Slytherin, yes, but she would do anything for attention from her chosen target, even play right into a Gryffindor's plan.

He watched Charlie get up and walk over to the two girls. He couldn't hear what Charlie said, but Pansy glanced sideways at him and then shrugged. Obviously a compliment then.

Draco left the odd couple to their own devices and walked over to observe the game of chess between Harry and Ron. He was surprised, again, to see that alcohol was involved. The Weasleys drank? The Golden Boy drank?

Harry lost a knight to Ron and took a shot. He coughed, teared up, and put the glass down hastily. Draco was somewhat comforted that at least some things were right in the world.

His world view was shattered again when the drinking increased as the night grew older. The adults constrained themselves to a few glasses of wine, but then Charlie and Bill sat down across the table from each other, both wearing identical expressions of determination.

"It's on, dragon-boy," said Bill.

"Please, you haven't had a decent drinking party for two years. Teaching is soft, Billy."

"And you would like us all to believe that dragon-taming is tough. I've visited your work. You were mucking stalls."

"Oi," said Fred, leaning over the table.

"Less talking, start drinking," said George.

Draco moved to stand beside Ginny just so he could ask "Is this normal?"

"Back when Bill was still curse-breaking, he and Charlie would get in these huge debates to prove who had the tougher job, so yeah, very normal. A tradition you could say."

Draco watched Fred and George set up a line of shots. The bottle they broke open was Beater's Vodka, and then they poured down the row. Bill and Charlie stared at each other, hands twitching until Fred called out, "Go!"

The room cheered the two older Weasley's on. Kingsley had taken a bet with Sirius, and their whoops could be heard over the rest of the clamor. Even Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were laughing.

Charlie finished half a glass before Bill, holding up his hands in triumph. Bill congratulated him in a show of good sportsmanship, but when Charlie waved for Fred to refill the glasses, he got up, stumbling a bit.

"Alright, maybe I got a little soft," he said. "But, I am a father now, and so I am going to set a good example and not drink myself into a stupor."

His proclamation, obviously a cop out, was met with jeers and laughter.

"Then it's up to us," said Fred, turning to George.

George nodded. "We could take Charlie."

Before either of them had a chance to challenge their brother, Pansy sat in Bill's vacated seat, raising her eyebrows at Charlie.

"Well?" asked Pansy to Fred and George. "Aren't you going to catch me up?"

The twins stared at the slim Slytherin girl, and Charlie shook his head.

"No way," he said. "I'm twice your weight, maybe more."

"Don't think I can handle it?" asked Pansy.

"No, I don't," said Charlie. "If you really want to try me, I'd say right from here is fine."

Pansy smiled, slowly. "You are going to regret that, Charles."

The twins poured another line of shots for each of them. Draco saw Sirius trying to cajole Kingsley into another bet, but the Auror wasn't taking it, thinking Charlie was the clear winner. He smirked. They had never been to a Slytherin party before.

"One, two, three, GO!" the twins called.

Charlie started downing shots hastily, slamming them back to the table, but Pansy was keeping pace with every shot he took. They pounded their last empty glass down together, each eyeing the other, waiting for the massive intake of alcohol to set in. Pansy giggled first, but it was clear that she still had most of her wits about her.

Charlie, on the other hand, was looking decidedly glassy-eyed. He tried to play it off.

"Not bad," he said, careful to annunciate well.

"Not bad?" Pansy asked. "You're about to pass out."

"Am not," said Charlie.

"Wanna go another then?" she asked wickedly.

"Sure, why not," said Charlie, stubbornly meeting her gaze.

That was when Mr. Weasley stepped in.

"I think that's enough. We allowed you to have your young fun here for safety precautions, but I'm afraid that because there are adults present, we're going to have to stop before the alcohol poisoning starts."

"I'm fine, dad," said Charlie. "Seriously, I can take another."

Mr. Weasley looked as if he was about to object, but to Draco's surprise, Mrs. Weasley stepped over. "Oh, let them, Arthur. You can't get alcohol poisoning off wizarding vodka, you know that. Let them have their fun."

"He'll regret it in the morning."

"And he's twenty-five."

Mr. Weasley relented, raising his hands in the air and backing off. More shots were poured. Charlie made it to the very end, a shot behind, but still looking triumphant. He smiled.

"Have enough?" he asked.

Pansy raised her eyebrows and waited. Charlie turned paler and paler before stumbling to his feet, swallowing convulsively and then making his way, as dignified as possible, to the bathroom.

Pansy stood up, a little wobbly, and took a bow to the cheers of the room.

"Incredible," breathed Fred.

"Un-bloody-believable," said George.

"You boys need to come to a Slytherin party," said Pansy.

"Slytherin parties, huh," mused Fred.

George got a thoughtful look on his face and together the twins turned to Draco.

"Alright, Malfoy," said George, and the twins sat at the table.

"Absolutely not," said Draco.

"He's a lightweight," said Ron, revealing the bit of information Draco had foolishly let spill while trying to escape the Dark Lord with a hole in his arm.

The twins snickered. Draco rolled his eyes.

"Come on, Malfoy," said Fred.

"Loosen up a bit," said George.

"You don't have to," said Bill, a bit unsteady from the alcohol but still sober enough to look concerned.

Draco looked over to the twins and then sighed. "Fine," he said. "But I choose the drink."

Fred and George both shrugged. Draco walked over to the counter and picked up three glasses and a bottle of wine.

"Are you serious, Malfoy?" asked Fred.

Draco put the glasses down and filled them nearly to the top.

"That's actually quite girly of you," said George.

"And that's when all culture is lost," said Draco. "When refinement is perceived as a loss of masculinity."

Draco handed the two glasses over and then sat. He raised his in a silent toast and then put it to his lips. Wine wasn't easy to chug, but it was possible to drink it quickly, and so he easily drained the glass, and then set it down. Raising his eyebrow at the twins, they started drinking as well.

It took two and a half bottles until Fred and George were decidedly tipsy. Another bottle, and they were similar shades of green.

"Want to stop now?" asked Draco. "Before you're both ill over the carpet?"

Fred looked at the last sip or two in his glass and pushed it aside. George put his head down on the table. Draco tipped the last bit into his mouth.

"I thought you said you were a lightweight."

Draco looked over at Ron and shrugged. "I've been having wine with dinner since I was six. It's the one thing I can handle."

He got up, feeling a bit lightheaded and wanting to do nothing more than curl up with a book somewhere to fall asleep. Ginny rewarded him with a quick hug and a laugh.

"Do me favor?" Draco asked.

"Of course."

"Don't let me drink anything else tonight. I would like to be able to function in the morning."

"Afraid of temptation?"

"I don't think straight when I'm drunk."

"You don't sound very drunk."

"I'm almost drunk."

Ginny smiled. "Okay. I'll keep you away from the booze. Although, you could have just said no to my brothers."

"I had to defend my honor."

"By drinking wine."

Draco shrugged. "Whatever it takes."

Draco enjoyed himself far more than he thought he would for the rest of the night. The wine helped. After the traditional New Year's kiss and another two hours of celebration, most of the party retired, and Draco gratefully crawled into bed.

He considered, for a moment, setting an alarm so that he could get up to hear Tierney's acceptance speech, but he doubted it would be something he hadn't heard before, so he simply closed his eyes and let the wine and the days accomplishments send him to sleep.

His door opening woke him up, but he was groggy, and pulling himself fully into consciousness was difficult. The hand shaking his shoulder made him groan and shove back.

"The hell?" he managed, sitting up and glancing at the clock. It was eight-thirty in the morning. He blinked at Sirius and then frowned. Black's face was tight with emotion. Pity. Concern. Apprehension. Uncertainty.

Draco swung his legs over the bed. "What happened?"

"Come downstairs," said Sirius, and then he left.

Draco pulled on a thick jumper and a pair of socks. He wasn't used to leaving his room in pajamas just yet, but Sirius' cryptic command let him know something was wrong.

Dumbledore was in the kitchen, as was Kingsley. Sirius wordlessly handed over the morning's newspaper.

Draco took it and scanned the first headline. 'Tierney Elected as Minister of Magic'. That was no surprise. The second was. 'Tierney's First Act to Name Fudge's Assassin, Lucius Malfoy'.

He stared at the words for a moment, trying to work past his disbelief. He sat down at the table and read the article. He re-read it for good measure and then set it aside. He got up, walked to the kitchen, and poured himself a mug of coffee. He rejoined the table.

"Is it true?" asked Dumbledore, gesturing to the article. He obviously knew Draco would know if his father had killed the Minister.

Draco didn't answer. Instead he took a deep drink of coffee.

"We're having a quick meeting," said Dumbledore. "But I thought we should wake you first for the news."

Draco nodded his appreciation and turned to Kingsley. "What do you know?" he asked. Tierney shouldn't be able to prove that Lucius killed Fudge. Draco doubted even he would be able to prove that Lucius murdered the Minister, and he knew that Lucius had possession of the knife. How could his father be implicated in the assassination?

Kingsley shook his head. "I was present for the swearing in of Tierney and his acceptance speech, and that's when he gave the news that Malfoy was arrested for the murder of Fudge, but that was all he said. He's keeping his cards pretty close to his chest, and I don't think we'll find out until the trial."

"I can find out though," said Draco. "Assuming Snape doesn't know anything either."

"He'll be here in a few minutes," said Dumbledore. "Sirius, if you wouldn't mind informing everyone else?"

Sirius nodded and headed upstairs. Draco finished his coffee and walked back upstairs as well. He wanted a shower and clean clothes. He needed a few minutes alone to process the information.

He took a quick shower before retreating to his room to change. He was finding it difficult to think about Lucius' incarceration objectively. He wasn't particularly worried, as Lucius had made several trips to Azkaban in the past, but thinking about his father brought up a myriad of emotions that he had been able to shove to the side while living with the Weasley family. He might complain about the level of noise and activity, he might roll his eyes at the jokes and the laughter, but it provided a distraction. It lightened his usually somber moods. It kept his darker thoughts at bay.

Now, with the onrush of emotions, his mind reacted by going numb. His thoughts were in a flurry, it was hard to concentrate, but he felt nothing, just the annoyance that his head couldn't seem to follow a simple train of thought.

He pulled on a pair of charcoal trousers, a white linen button up, and a knit indigo jumper over that. It was too formal for breakfast, but he was planning on leaving afterwards. Percy Weasley had given him the password to his study, and he would know exactly what had happened.

He combed his hair quickly and pulled on his shoes. He pocketed both wands.

Most of the Order had gathered by the time he descended the stairs again. The teens were still in their pajamas while the adults had dressed, but obviously with haste. Dumbledore must have already filled them in on the purpose of the meeting, because they all turned to look at Draco coming in, their faces a mix of concern and apprehension. Snape looked at him with a measuring glance.

"How are you?" Ginny asked in a whisper when he sat beside her.

He nodded in response, as if that was really an answer, and then poured himself another mug of coffee from the carafe for something to do.

"The Death Eaters aren't saying anything," Snape started. "In fact, we haven't had a meeting in a few days. If the Dark Lord is involved, he's keeping it from his followers, at least for now."

"Do we think that he was involved?" asked Lupin from across the table.

"No offense," said Fred, speaking up and addressing Draco, "but if the bastard we know as Lucius Malfoy is imprisoned-,"

"Fred!" exclaimed Mrs. Weasley, shocked that he would say so in front of Draco.

"Then why do we care if he is in prison?" George finished for his twin.

"Because he's in prison for one of two reasons," said Draco coolly. "The first is that in order to imprison Lucius Malfoy, there must be a regime change in the Inner Circle, and that's something we need to know. The second is that the imprisonment is just a front to cover for something much bigger than the assassination of a Minister."

"Exactly," said Dumbledore. "And either of those options do not bode well for us."

"If Lucius Malfoy is no longer Voldemort's right hand man, how is that bad for us?" asked Mrs. Weasley, phrasing the question delicately.

"Because Lucius," said Dumbledore, "while a ruthless man, is still a sane one."

"He's helped do the most damage, Albus," said Mr. Weasley. "I will not be sorry to see him go, not even if he is your father, Draco. He is a cruel and terrible man."

"Arthur," hissed Mrs. Weasley.

Draco shrugged. "You might be sorry," he said. "What the Headmaster is saying is that Lucius, being a sane man, is looking for a decisive Pureblood win, as quickly and as effortlessly as possible. Because of that, you're looking at a fierce battle, but a short one. His influence on the Dark Lord has been to stop the more gruesome raids and focus on military strikes. Instead of torturing families, Lucius directed the attacks against government leaders. Instead of attacking hospitals, Lucius targeted the Ministry. Without Lucius, the Dark Lord would be free to follow his whims. That means more torture, more tragedies, more women and children dead. Chaos and fear are harder to fight."

"You're saying I should mourn his loss?" asked Mr. Weasley.

"Of course not," said Draco. "I'm just correcting you. Is he cruel? Yes, he can be, but not terrible. You haven't seen terrible yet."

His words were met with silence and unease. Bill cleared his throat.

"So," he said, "I guess the most important thing then is trying to figure out what exactly is going on. We know that Tierney is most likely working with the Death Eaters, because of the whole Dementor attack, but do we know how he would have the power to jail Lucius Malfoy? Even if Lucius did kill Fudge, I thought there wasn't any evidence to point to anyone specifically."

"There isn't," said Dumbledore. "Tierney must have some sort of fabricated evidence, or inside knowledge. Our own attempts to interpret the situation might be hindered by the fact that we don't know who the real assassin is, but with Kingsley's position, we shouldn't be in the dark too long."

Draco rolled his eyes. "Well, of course, it was Lucius," he said.

"What?" asked Charlie.

"Lucius killed Fudge. Who else could do that and get away with it?" asked Draco.

"He didn't exactly get away with it," said Sirius.

Draco waved that off. "Something else happened then. There is no way Tierney should be able to prove that Lucius killed Fudge. The plan was ingenious."

There was silence. Most of the members at the table looked decidedly uncomfortable and disapproving. Draco took a sip of his coffee.

"I've a contact at the Ministry," he said, putting the cup down gently. "If there's nothing else, I'll be heading out."

"This contact," said Bill, "is it safe to meet with him, or her?"

"As safe as talking to you," said Draco, disguising honesty with flippancy.

Bill frowned. "When you say it like that, I don't know if I should believe you."

"Of course you should," said Draco. He stood and nodded farewell and then took the Floo to Percy Weasley's study.

The study was the Assistant's office. The Assistant usually spent most of his or her day sitting at a desk outside of the Minister's office and overseeing everything that went on. Because the Assistant needed a Floo and access to owls and a quiet place to work for the really important things, the Assistant's study was created.

It was on the opposite end of the Ministry, in a secluded wing, and it was accessible from the Assistant's desk by a permanent Portkey to cut the travelling time to virtually nonexistent. There was a door as well, but one with as many wards as a Gringott's bank account (because the study housed multitudes of confidential information), and the Floo which was password protected. Not even the Minister could walk into the Assistant's study uninvited. Draco, of course, had been given a standing invitation with the password.

Percy wasn't there when Draco arrived. Draco knew how busy the Assistant must be, especially now. Not only was there a new Minister, but the first act had been to accuse one of the most powerful men in the Ministry of assassinating the late Minister. The media would be all over the Ministry, and Percy would be the one tying to get control of the chaos.

So Draco explored the study while he waited. It was large, with two armchairs by the fireplace, a huge desk and matching chair behind it, and two more sat in front. Towards the side was a small kitchen, well blended into the room with matching earth tones. There was a half-stove and a few cabinets holding dishes and staple items.

The cabinets and the desk were carefully organized. All the dishes were stacked perfectly, and the utensils on the desk were set up in straight, ninety degree angles. Percy's filing cabinets were alphabetized, but they were the type that could also sort them by date if need be. He had a calendar on the wall and a day-by-day calendar on the desk. Both had the same information written down in careful handwriting. Percy Weasley appeared to be just a little bit OCD.

Draco waited for about an hour, not a surprise really. Most officials had left the Ministry at ten, after the speech and the initial shock of the news of Lucius Malfoy's arrest. The officials had been at the Ministry since eleven the night before, and the Ministry would be closed for the rest of the day. It was a holiday after all.

When Percy finally appeared in his office, he did so through the standing Portkey set up at his other desk. It was a gentle Portkey, with a soft wooshing sound, and there he was, sitting behind the large desk. He immediately slumped forward, head in his hands and letting out a deep sigh which was interrupted by a yawn.

He looked up and saw Draco.

"Give me a minute, Malfoy," he said, obviously not surprised to see him there.

Draco didn't want to give a minute, but he let Percy walk over to the stove and put the kettle on. It boiled in ten seconds, thanks to state-of-the-art spells, and then Percy poured himself a cup of tea.

"Anything?" he asked Draco.

"No," said Draco.

Percy took his cup of tea (hollymint, used in cases of muscle tension) and sat in one of the armchairs. He looked exhausted. The fire obligingly flared up with cheery flames dancing in the hearth. Draco took the chair across from him.

"There's no way Tierney should be able to prove that Lucius killed Fudge," said Draco.

"There's always a way," said Percy, but Draco shook his head.

"No. Not this time."

Percy let out a slow breath, took a sip of tea, and then spoke.

"The thing is, Lucius Malfoy really had no reason to kill Minister Fudge, did he?"

"Not personally, no," said Draco.

"So someone must have told him to kill Fudge, meaning that other people would know as well. Maybe they even knew the method of murder."

"You're saying someone turned him in," said Draco. He shook his head. "The only people who would know of Lucius' involvement would be Death Eaters. You're saying that a fellow Death Eater, who obviously knew Lucius was ordered to kill the Minister, went against the Dark Lord's wishes to turn him in."

"Yes," said Percy. "That is what I am saying."

Draco stared at Percy. Serious blue eyes stared right back.

"That's ridiculous," said Draco. "What could they possibly gain from that?"

"Apparently," said Percy, "she wants to be the new right hand of Voldemort."

Draco paused, his mind going blank for the briefest of seconds with the knowledge that only one Death Eater would have the gall to turn in Lucius Malfoy, invoking not only the wrath of the Dark Lord, but the Malfoy name was well. With that name came the realization that, for the first time, Lucius might not be able to extract himself from Azkaban.

Draco clenched his fist.

"Bellatrix," he said. The name left a foul taste on his lips. The darker thoughts in his mind, the ones that screamed for power and Angel-Flight, the thoughts that had been so quiet this past month, too quiet, stirred and started whispering.

"Bellatrix Lestrange," Percy confirmed.

He'd never liked his Aunt. He didn't remember ever meeting her when he was younger, but he heard stories, stories that had terrified him. When he had met her for the first time, after her escape from Azkaban, she had grabbed his chin, forcing him to look up into her hollow, bloodshot eyes, and placed a kiss on his forehead. Her lips were cold and clammy and her fingernails were long and sharp.

"As Minister in times of war, Tierney has the power to sit with members of the opposing force, either to negotiate a surrender or receive vital information," Percy was saying. Draco only half heard him.

She had never liked Lucius, and so never liked Draco. She had sparred with him a few times, telling the rest she was training him. Draco hadn't been able to do his best as he was still hiding his talent. He had blocked the worst of her curses, but had to let through several dark ones, ones that froze the marrow in his bones and scorched the air in his lungs. All magically reversible, non-fatal. She had laughed while he twisted in pain. She was disappointed when he didn't cry.

"He says that Bellatrix sent him a letter a day before he became Minister offering the name of Fudge's murderer."

He could find her easily enough. She wasn't always playing lackey to the Dark Lord, especially now that he had Claire, young and unspoiled from Azkaban. What would hurt her the most? Losing her hands, or simply all of her fingers? Losing her eyes, or just her tongue? There were a million ways he could disfigure her. A million ways for her to die pain, in despair.

"Right after we informed him of his title, he brought her into the room and she gave up your father," Percy finished.

"He's not my father," said Draco automatically.

"Legally, perhaps not," said Percy. "But you did come here."

He did come here. He came and now he was plotting the murder of his aunt for the possible death of his father who had disowned him, his father who had chosen a living, maniacal corpse over him.

Draco pushed away the whispers in his head. "I came here because I thought Lucius might have something else planned," he said.

"And now?"

"Now I think he should have seen this coming."

How had Lucius missed this? Nothing escaped his father. What had happened to cause such neglect?

"Are you going to do anything?" asked Percy.

"Like what?"

Percy shrugged a shoulder. "Tierney's pushing for a War Council instead of a trial. Lucius Malfoy will not be tried by the Wizengamot. He will have no appeal. Conviction will lead to the Kiss."

Draco had already figured that would be the course of action, but hearing it aloud caused him to flinch.

He could take a page out of her own book. The Cruciatus curse was often overlooked because it was simply the most well known torture curse. It was the most well-known because it worked so well. She would die screaming. He'd have to tell Neville Longbottom.

"Lucius already has lawyers," said Percy, "but Veritaserum will be used, so unless you have a counter to that, the verdict will be guilty."

The counter was still in its theoretical stages, but even if it had been ready, would he really give it to Lucius? Familial disputes aside, there was no denying what sort of man his father was. There was no denying that helping him go free would be lead to the deaths of others. Draco found himself in a morally quandary. He wasn't used to the feeling.

There was too much to think about. He stood abruptly and nodded.

"I appreciate the information."

"What are you going to do?" asked Percy.

Draco shrugged a shoulder. "I need more information," he said. He would ask around. He would learn everything he could. He would wait.

"I'm sorry I can't be of more help," said Percy.

"You've been exceedingly helpful," said Draco. "I just need a different sort of information. Have a good day." He threw Floo powder on the flames and stepped through.

OoOoOoOoOo—OoOoOoOoOo—OoOoOoOoOo

"Where have you been?" Bill demanded when Draco stepped out of the fireplace.

It was four o'clock. Draco had been gone far too long for a simple meeting with a contact. He couldn't see any signs of injury though. Draco's clothing was impeccable, as always, and he didn't appear to be in pain. His expression was tight though, matching Bill's at that moment. With every hour that passed, Bill got more and more concerned that Draco was going to do something more befitting a Gryffindor.

Draco raised an eyebrow. "Out," he said.

"Real mature, Draco," said Bill.

"Then why were you worrying?" asked Draco, deliberately overlooking his sarcasm. He walked back into his study and Bill, after exchanging a frustrated expression with Charlie and Sirius who were in the dining room, followed him back.

Draco was pulling off his coat when Bill stepped into the study. Bill watched the way Draco casually tossed it over the back of his chair and then sat at his piano. Draco played a few arpeggios, all the way up and down the keys, both hands, very quickly.

"Learn anything?" Bill asked.

The answer was obviously 'yes', but he waited to see if Draco would tell him.

"You could say that," said Draco.

Music filled the pause.

"What are you going to do?" asked Bill.

"I honestly do not know," Draco admitted in a matter-of-fact tone.

Bill wanted to ask what it was Draco had found out. He wanted to know what was so troubling. Draco would never tell though, not unless he was ready. He fell back on his usual question.

"How are you?"

"Fine."

Bill sighed and pulled out a chair to sit in.

"Look, Draco, I'm worried about you. Your father is in jail, he's probably going to be sentenced to the Kiss, you've been gone all morning and afternoon, and I know that there is a lot of trouble you could have been getting yourself into, so could you please tell me how you are doing and how I can help?"

Draco stopped playing. He let his hands drop in his lap and bowed his head. He let out a measured breath.

"I don't know," he said. "It's…surreal. Lucius has always gotten off before, or managed to escape, but now…if what I've heard is true, I don't think he's getting out of it."

"Could you tell me?" Bill tried.

"I…not right now."

"Should you tell me?"

Draco straightened and turned around on the bench. "I need to do something," he evaded. "Are you feeling up to some Runes work? You'll need to get started if you want to publish your book sometime in this decade."

Bill looked at him, saw the turmoil in the stormy eyes, and nodded. Questions could come later.

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO

Darn that evil Bellatrix. Alright, I really will be pushing for two weeks, and not three this time. Please leave a review!





24. A Brush with Murder

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would have the ability, and time, to think of a witty disclaimer.

Author's note: So….three weeks and an hour late then? School is seriously kicking my butt. Luckily, I was able to write this over Thanksgiving break, or most of it. It really sucks that I'm so busy, because I know where I want to go with these chapters, and there's nearly no planning involved, but I'm just so busy. It's absolutely ridiculous. Anyway, enough of my ranting. Enjoy the chapter. The next chapter should only be two weeks in the making as it's finals in one week, or there about, which means all-day study time, and really, who needs to study all day? Time to write, hurrah! Sorry I'm not replying to reviews again.

o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

Draco refused to look at the paper the next day and avoided the radio. Lucius' trial started at nine am the day after he was taken. Minister Tierney had wanted to have the trial that day, but Lucius' contingent of lawyers had managed to stall for the day at least. Lucius had spent the night in Azkaban, not a new experience for him, and then the trial had begun.

Draco would have listened had it been an ordinary trial, but because Fudge had been killed by a supposed Death Eater, Wizarding England was now, through technicalities, involved in a war. Lucius would be tried as an enemy of the country by a war tribune. He would be forced to testify under Veritaserum. Bellatrix would be allowed to give testimony against him. There would only be one verdict.

There were loopholes, of course, but they would only delay the Kiss. Even stalling would do nothing because Draco's contacts, and Snape, had said nothing about the Dark Lord's reaction to Lucius' imprisonment. Could it be he was not rescuing his right hand man this time? Could Bellatrix have convinced him to do nothing?

No, such a thought was ludicrous. Lucius was one of the most powerful men in the wizarding world. To leave Lucius to the Kiss would be cutting off his arm; it would be crippling to lose that support. No, Lucius would be rescued once more.

Still, he avoided the trial. Draco worked on the runes, catching Bill up and then finishing the dialects. They planned out the first few chapters of the book, or rather, Draco planned them out when Bill was not around to distract him, and then turned to the Veritaserum counter – which really was far from completion – anything to keep his mind occupied.

He didn't leave his study, because the rest of the house was following the trial, and he could tell by the guiltily triumphant looks on their faces that it wasn't going well.

He stayed in the study until late, until his exhausted mind finally couldn't think anymore, but instead of a numb relief, the lack of thoughts meant he was free to feel. Emotions surged through him, coursing through his mind, rising and falling, twisting and looping, and he, unused to such feelings, could only name them as they passed by.

Disbelief. Not a surprise. The entire country was in shock.

Uncertainty. Lucius would be freed, but the Dark Lord was running out of time to plan the escape. What was taking so long? Another doubt, why had Bellatrix no been punished for her betrayal yet? What was he waiting for?

Denial. His father was untouchable, or so he had thought. Yet Bellatrix had Lucius arrested with a simple declaration. If, for some strange, inconceivable reason, the Dark Lord did not rescue Lucius, it would be the end. Lucius, who may be cold and unfeeling, but was always alive. His eyes always saw through the hardest of masks, his wit was always deadly, his strength never failing.

Fear. Not for himself. For his father. But that was an illogical emotion. His father was in no danger; the Dark Lord would see to that.

Draco sat at his desk and put his head in his hands. He concentrated on breathing, deep and even. He was suddenly drained of all energy and even moving from his desk seemed to be a monumental task. He made it to his room, however, and sank onto the bed. His eyes shut without conscious thought or effort and he slept.

He slept until nine the next morning, and he if dreamed, he didn't remember it. When he woke, he dug through his trunk for his small radio and turned it on, listening for any news about Lucius before venturing out of his room, but while the trial was over, no decision had been reached yet. The media was reporting there would be a decision by the afternoon.

Draco showered and dressed, unconsciously pulling on a few of his more expensive garments and combing his hair until it shone.

The family was particularly kind to him, and Draco decided not be a bastard and call them out on it. He retreated back to his study but came out in the afternoon. Bill was listening to the radio in the living room, rocking a fussing Lukas, and Draco joined him, sitting on the floor and staring at the fire.

The news casters were running through the charges, bringing up every rumor they had ever heard about Lucius. Some of them were true, some were laughable. Draco's name was brought up several times as well, but less was said about him. It appeared wizarding England was ready to believe that his association with Harry Potter and the Weasley family had changed him for the better.

"You don't have to listen," said Bill. "I could tell you when they reach a verdict."

"There's only one verdict they'll reach," said Draco.

"Then should you really be listening to this?"

Draco didn't answer. There was knowing what the verdict would be, and then there was hearing it. In all of his life, Draco had never thought Lucius Malfoy would be convicted of anything as little as insider trading. He never expected this, never thought it was possible.

He waited for half an hour before the broadcasters announced the reconvening of the war council. It took another fifteen minutes for the members to get settled and for the defense and prosecution to assemble. Draco knew Lucius was there, standing behind the table with his contingent of lawyers. Surely he knew there was no hope for an acquittal, but what other plan did he have? There must be another plan. Lucius would not be Kissed.

"We, the council of the Ministry of Magic, find the defendant, Monsieneur Lucius Malfoy, guilty of the assassination of Minister Cornelius Fudge," the head reported. "He will be sentenced to the Kiss of the Dementor."

There was instant uproar. Cheers, shouts of disbelief, denials, applause. Draco stopped breathing.

"Lucius Malfoy has placed his appeal, and the Council will take twenty-four hours to consider his argument. This courtroom is adjourned."

The spectators erupted again. Draco could barely hear the broadcaster's voice above the others. It was almost a static. Even the room appeared to be a bit fuzzy. He couldn't quite wrap his mind around the fact that his father had been found guilty. The appeal would not go through; Lucius would be moved to a secure holding cell right after the decision came in. He would stay there the night, and in the morning, he would be Kissed.

Did it hurt? Having your soul ripped out, was it painful? Was it true that once the soul was inside the Dementor, there could be no afterlife until the Dementor was destroyed? A Purgatory, in a sense. Suffering for the wicked before a greater judgment.

"Draco!" A hand shook his shoulder, and Draco started, his lungs finally expanding with air. The inrush of oxygen cleared his mind and he blinked to see Bill hovering over him.

"You okay?" Bill asked.

On the radio, the chaos had settled down slightly, and the broadcaster was still speaking. Bill reached over and flicked it off before any words could be understood.

"Are you going to be okay?" Bill reiterated.

In the silence, Draco felt a slow poison rise in his chest. He'd felt it a few times before, when Lukas was killed, when he first met the Dark Lord, but this time the poison was choking. It was burning away at his mind and a writhing, primal desire began to seep into his veins, coursing through every inch of him until his fingers curled into fists, nails biting at his palms.

Draco nodded, cool mask hiding the dark thoughts. "I'm alright." His voice came out measured, if a little breathless.

"Draco-,"

"I'm alright," said Draco again. He got to his feet. "I'm going to my room. I need to think."

"You do too much of that," said Bill, half-joking, trying to lighten the mood.

Draco's chest twisted in hatred at that little bit of levity. Bill's concern was stifling him, smothering him. The black voice inside of him screamed for air. It was irrational; he knew that, but right now, he needed to get away.

He forced his lips upward in a small smile at Bill, who looked considerably off put at the expression.

"I'll be fine," he said.

He walked out of the room. A radio was on in the kitchen, and several members of the family were gathered around the dining room table. They all looked at him; he didn't look back. He was suddenly afraid that if he did, he might curse them all.

He ran lightly up the stairs and once he was in his room, he closed his door and leaned against it, trying to regulate his breathing, trying to keep his hands from shaking. The burning poison was rushing to his head, demanding blood. Somewhere, a part of him, the rational part that spoke in a voice that was a cross of Lukas and Bill, was telling him to stop, to take ten minutes, to talk to someone. He ruthlessly, deliberately, silenced that voice.

He wasn't a Gryffindor. He wasn't even nice most of the time. He had morals, but very few. He did not see any reason to change, and now he saw no reason to hide any longer. He was a child of dark magic, raised on illegal curses and an absence of love. He was strong, a forced to be reckoned with, and now he was going to show his aunt what a mistake she had made. He may not be a Malfoy any longer in name, but his blood was pure. He would no longer deny himself his true heritage. He reveled in his freedom now, wondering why he had ever stifled his talent. He recalled his weak, ineffectual time spent with the Order, and it disgusted him how he had changed.

When Draco stood and crossed over to his trunk, the thought of leaving a note for Bill didn't even occur to him. He changed, dressing in his Feles uniform and adding a long, black leather coat over that. He shrank his broom and pocketed it along with his registered wand. He slipped a ring on his finger, strapped a watch onto his wrist, and slipped a crystal ball into his outer coat pocket, along with a pouch of coins. He laced his leather boots on tight, slipping a lock-picking knife into his right boot, and then grabbed his unregistered wand. He tapped the necklace Bill had given him, casting a Portkey and return spell, just in case, and then grasped the charm. He was jerked away.

Knockturn Alley was always dark and dismal, but the sleet splattering from the dark sky and the bitter wind made the disreputable streets even more inhospitable. Draco appeared in the middle of the road which was empty of the usual miscreants. The news of Lucius Malfoy's trial and verdict would have hit this community hard. While some might celebrate his passing, if Lucius could be tried and found guilty, who knew who would be next?

Draco strode down the street and arrived at the Ravus Umbra. He could see through the small, dirt-crusted windows that the bar was packed with dark wizards and witches and various other creatures. Nothing brought criminals together like the news of a crime lord's downfall.

He reached for the door handle and flung it open. Lucius knew how to make an entrance, but Draco got his true flare of dramatics from Narcissa, one of the few things he had inherited from her.

The bar's patrons all looked over and then stared. Draco stepped in and let the wind slam the door shut behind him. He swept over the costumers with a cool gaze and then spotted a group of men sitting in a booth alongside the wall. These were the contacts for corrupt Ministry officials. They carried out the darker deeds of the Ministry's governors, blackmail, coercion, death threats, and selling national secrets.

Draco walked directly towards them, his footsteps echoing in the silence. He grabbed an empty chair from the table across from them and set it down at the head of their table with a bang. He deliberately sat in the chair. The window across from him was clean enough to reflect whatever may happen behind him.

He pointedly waited until conversation behind him started again. While he waited, he studied the scum of Knockturn ally, the men that made a life of crime possible. Ashby, forty-six, married into relative wealth. He was a sweaty, balding man whose interests lay in younger women. Across from him, Forbis and Gardner, both working the black market of national and international secrets. They were pale and pasty and were both expert duelers.

He smiled at the men, a hard smile, unfeeling. "I'm in need of some information," he said. "You are going to give me what I need."

Forbis and Gardner exchanged a look. Ashby laughed.

"Right," he said. What was left of Ashby's hair was worn in an unfortunate comb-over which only accentuated the fat in his cheeks. "Because we take orders from deposed heirs of a failing fortune with ties to Dumbledore. Do yourself a favor, kid, and stay out of grown-up affairs. Go back to that good little girlfriend of yours and her suck you off if you're feeling a little rowdy, and if she won't, here." Ashby flicked a galleon at him. "Buy yourself someone who will."

Forbis and Gardner laughed. Draco turned a cool, unimpressed expression onto Ashby that silenced the trio more effectively than a crucio, although the curse would be much more satisfying.

"Tell me, Ashby," he said. "If Aurors were to raid your houses at this very minute, what do you think would get you in the most trouble, the files you stole from the Magical Defense Department on the movements of our undercover operatives, or the underaged mistress you have currently warming your bed? I understand your wife is your main source of income. However will you buy your expensive wine without her financial support?"

Ashby stared at him, then blinked and downed his whiskey. "You're bluffing," he said.

Draco leaned in. "Can you afford to take that risk?"

Ashby glanced to his companions, then back. "What do you want?"

"Nothing too costly, or too difficult. I need the locations of the safe houses in use by the Ministry."

Ashby chuckled. "And I have some friends currently staying in those safe houses. I may be a snitch, but I don't squeal on my friends."

"It's not your friends I'm after," said Draco. "I need to know the location of Bellatrix Lestrange."

That got Ashby's attention. "Bellatrix, huh?" he asked. "Isn't she your aunt, or something?"

"You can't choose your family," said Draco.

"And when you find her, then what?"

Draco sat back in his chair, eyebrow raised. "Can't you imagine it, Ashby? I could describe the gory particulars if you wanted. I have been told I'm quite innovative with the dark curses."

Ashby raised his hands. "Alright, alright. Just asking. There are three that were put into use right after Tierney named her a witness, but the word is that she's just south of Scotland. Barrick Manor. Need a map?" The last was said with a mocking tone. Draco ignored it.

"Thank you for your cooperation," he said. He pulled out a small pouch of galleons and tossed it on the table. "For the inconvenience."

It was a good amount he had given for knowledge he could have gleaned from eight other spies he was aware of. He walked towards the back and Flooed to the Sparrowhawk, another pub of ill repute, only a short broom ride from the safe house.

Draco had to keep a high altitude in flight, as not to be detected by the wards around the house, and the air was frigid. Even the heat-regulating leather coat Draco wore wasn't enough to keep out the chill, and his exposed skin went numb only three minutes out.

He located the house, alone in a stretch of woods, and slowly descended. His ring flashed when he was thirty feet over the roof and he stopped. The Ministry used the same wards for every house. They were good wards, but like any security system, there was always a way around it.

Draco tilted his broom downwards ever-so-slightly, and then cast a temporary immobilization charm on himself. He never said that getting around the wards was particularly safe. At this moment, if any Aurors were patrolling the house and happened to look up, he would be unable to move to defend himself. Still, the wards wouldn't register such a smooth, gradual motion. They were specifically tied into human movement, so that every little animal or falling leaf didn't put the guards on high alert. All Draco had to do was ride through them completely still.

It took a few minutes to get through, as he had set his broom on one of the slowest descents possible, but also because the wards were thick. It took several moments to ride through the thick magic, and towards the end he could feel his immobilization charm slowly melt away, but he broke free of the ward just in time.

He circled the house once before setting down on the roof. He couldn't see any signs of activity. The Aurors were all probably inside, and Bellatrix would be in the most central room.

Draco shrunk his broom and pocketed it again. He pulled out his unregistered wand and turned the ring on his hand and curled his palm around the gem. The stone was sharp, and it pierced his skin. Draco pointed his wand at the roof.

"Liquefacio," he whispered, and he sank through into the attic. He next pulled out the crystal globe and held it up. Inside the sphere, the house appeared, and then the walls were taken off. Draco could see inside the rooms, he could see the occupants. Two Aurors in the front hall, another in the kitchen. Two were upstairs. Bellatrix was in a study, almost directly below him.

Draco put the crystal ball back as well. Normally such a dark artifact would be detected by the wards, his spells would have been detected as well, but that was the beauty of the ring he was wearing. It redirected the remains of the spell into himself, cleaning up any loose magic to avoid detection. It wasn't healthy to use for the long term, but as long as he purged the remains from his body when he was finished, he would be fine.

He knelt and pressed his hand on the floor and cast the spell to fall through the floor again. He dropped lightly into the study and Bellatrix whipped around, leaping from the armchair she had been reclining in. Her hand went to her waist, but her wand wasn't there.

Draco smirked. "I thought the Aurors might have confiscated your wand, Aunt Bella."

Bellatrix's eyes narrowed, but she merely sank back into her chair.

"Draco," she said. "Quite the surprise, seeing you here. I had thought, seeing as Lucius so casually discarded you, that familial retribution would be the last thing on your mind. But then again, you were always so helplessly devoted to him. I saw it when I first met you after my little exile in Azkaban. Tell me, how did you feel when daddy threw you out?"

"Seeing as I chose the path that would lead to my disownment, he didn't exactly throw me out. You could say I left."

"And yet here you are. Wanting revenge for Lucius' imminent demise."

"Got it in one," said Draco.

"Will you forever be groveling for his approval, Draco?"

"I stopped looking for his approval a year ago. This is something different; this is revenge."

She didn't take his announcement lightly. Instead she shrieked and ran at him, hands outstretched and curved into claws. A simply tripping hex and she sprawled. Draco grabbed her by her thick tangle of hair and jerked her backwards, onto her knees, her head bent back awkwardly. A simple twist and her neck would break. It was an enticing thought, but it was entirely too soon. She screamed her rage, and he kicked her in the side, right below her ribs, where her kidneys were. She grunted and tried to bend over. He didn't let her.

"Tell me, Bellatrix," he asked, pulling her head back even farther and staring her in the face. "Did you turn Lucius in because you were too afraid to confront him face to face?"

She spat at him. "It was the only way to be permanently rid of him. You Malfoys are the scourge of the Purebloods, unwilling to see your Master's plans to fruition if it means minor discomfort to yourself."

"We Malfoys have no master, that's your first mistake," said Draco. He shoved her to the floor and pulled out his wand. "Crucio."

She screamed and writhed. Draco turned away from her and surveyed the room. She was living in luxury. The fireplace was marble and gold. The chair she had been sitting in was velvet and plush. There was a liquor cabinet and a shelf of books along the back wall as well as a writing desk and supplies. It was intolerable.

The blackness rose up inside of him and he cut off the curse, striding back to his aunt and grabbing her by the hair again. When she struggled, he took her head and smashed it against the coffee table beside the fireplace. She was more pliant when blood gushed from her forehead.

He threw her on the floor in front of the fireplace and then picked up a poker beside the mantle and speared it into a burning log. He let the poker stay to heat up. He could have done it with a spell, but he found anticipation was a great tool to use in torture.

"I understand why you're upset," he told her as she lay dazed on the floor, hand at her head, staring up at him with a weak hatred in her eyes. "Your pathetic excuse for a life demands some obsession, something greater than yourself. You're directionless, weak, helpless, and yet you desire greatness. That is why you must let him consume you. That is why you sacrifice your life."

She snorted, opening her mouth to cut him off, but he flicked his wand and she screamed as the bones in her right foot were crumpled in an invisible fist, squeezing and grinding, until the deformity was visible even through her boot.

"Don't interrupt your betters, Bellatrix," said Draco evenly. "And that is what we are. Malfoys. Not the scourge you revile, but the splendor you could never achieve."

He crouched down. "Oh, poor, disillusion, hopeless Bellatrix. Even Narcissa was smarter than you. She married into grandeur."

"Narcissa is worthless," Bellatrix hissed out. "She is a disgrace to the family of Black by allying herself with Lucius, but at least she had the right idea, trying to kill you. If I was her, I wouldn't have stopped with the drugs, I would have strangled you myself!"

Draco flicked his wand and her right leg bent ninety-degrees at her calf. She screeched and Draco surveyed the displaced leg with a critical eye.

"Does that hurt?" he asked. "I could do much worse, you know. I could turn your bones into ice, and then throw you into the fire and watch you melt from the inside out. I could boil your eyes and make them burst into your brain, destroying your ability to think. I could remove your fingers, at the first knuckle, and then the second, and then again until all you had would be worthless paddles. Would your Master reconstruct you, like a broken doll? Are would he throw you away with the Muggles he tires with?"

"Whatever you do to me, he will do to you at a measure ten times greater than what you inflict now," Bellatrix whispered.

Draco laughed. "I doubt he can exceed my creativity, dear Aunt."

He stepped back and cast a dark curse that slowly peeled her fingernails off. Ignoring her cry, he walked over to the liquor cabinet and poured himself a glass of brandy. He carried the glass back over and sipped the alcohol while she writhed. When her moans subsided, he crystallized her blood cells and finished off the brandy while she screamed as her blood tore gouges in even the smallest of her capillaries and scoured the chambers of her heart.

This spell wasn't lethal. Because the blood was crystallized, she wouldn't bleed out, but it was excruciating.

"I am going to kill you," he told the tortured woman. "I want you to know that. When you are in such pain that you curse the day you were born, just remember, it will all be over soon, and I will send your soul to Hades. And don't be trite and say 'I'll see you there', because I know you probably will. I am killing my own aunt after all."

He walked over to the fireplace and set the glass down on the mantle. He pulled the poker from the log and then shook the remaining coals off of the prong over Bellatrix's injured form.

"Did you know your Master dared to mark me?" Draco asked her.

"He marks his own, and he marks those he will destroy," Bellatrix rasped.

Draco gave a harsh laugh. "He hasn't been able to kill me yet. In fact, his track record leaves a lot of room for improvement."

He cast a body bind on Bellatrix and then crouched next to her form, grasping her left arm and pushing back her robes to reveal the Dark Mark.

"I figure this is your most prized possession," he said, referring to the tattoo. He pressed the poker down on her flesh, the hiss and smell completely revolting, but he still dragged the poker across her arm, and then again, a crude 'X' over the snake and skull.

"I would go for something a little more sophisticated," he told her, "but you're not going to be alive long enough to really appreciate my artistic talent."

He took off the body bind, and now she could finally scream at him. Her rage wasn't surprising, but her actions were. He forgot that the insane were usually paired with extreme amounts of strength, and so he was taken off guard when she lunged for him. He was taken off guard, but his reflexes had been honed, and so he jumped back and cast the Cruciatus again.

She fell to the floor, yelling in pain and anger. He left the curse on until she lost control of her body and her muscles started to twitch and seize. She gasped in a few breaths, and then began to laugh, high, cackling laughter that had great capacity to unnerve even the most unflappable.

"You stupid, predictable, little boy," she heaved. "With all of your assertions of intelligence. Your arrogance will always be your greatest weakness. Lucius had it. Now he's going to be Kissed."

"No," said Draco. "You may have turned him in, but if you really think the Dark Lord will just sit by while his strongest ally is executed, you're more inane than I thought. Lucius Malfoy is one of the most powerful men in all of England."

"Not anymore," said Bellatrix.

"So what? The Dark Lord's just going to let him rot?" Draco asked.

Bellatrix laughed again. "Silly boy," she said. "The Dark Lord was the one who put Lucius in Azkaban."

There was an odd rushing in his ears. His heart clenched and his stomach felt as if he had just dropped into a freefall on a broom.

"What?" he heard himself saying.

"The Dark Lord told me to turn Lucius in. He gave me all of the details. You see, Draco, Lucius was getting a little difficult to manage. It was almost as if he didn't want to take orders anymore, and so after becoming Lucius' heir, the Dark Lord decided it was time to part ways, and get rid of a Minister at the same time."

Draco took a step back. "This is ridiculous," he said. "Lucius would never-,"

"Lucius, Lucius, Lucius," mocked Bellatrix. "You really are hopeless dependant, aren't you? Well it's time to grow up, boy, because your beloved father isn't as smart as you thought he was. For all of his arrogance and airs, all it took was one word from the Dark Lord to bring him down. The reign of the Malfoy family is over. Tomorrow, he will be sentenced, and then, he will be Kissed. He will die."

"You're lying," said Draco, advancing on her. He slashed his wand through the air, an identical wound appearing across Bellatrix's chest, slicing through robes and flesh. Blood gushed out, some splattering across Draco's face and clothes. "You're lying!"

He grabbed her, pulling her to her feet with adrenaline-induced strength and smashed her against the wall. Her blood spilled onto his hands, but he hardly noticed. He pressed the tip of his wand at her heart and spoke softly, invoking a dark curse that would turn her heart from a living muscle, into a dead mass of tissue.

"Good-bye, Aunt Bella," he said, as she gasped, hands clawing at her chest. "I'm afraid I have no patience for your senseless prattle." Her eyes rolled back in her head and she slipped, grabbing onto his robes, and then one hand grabbed his neck, yanking his head down so she could whisper in his ear, voice hoarse and strained.

"Then why is the Dark Lord coming to save me?"

He let her drop, whirling around to the door as she laughed with the last of her breaths.

The door burst open, and there stood Voldemort, draped in black and green, a line of Death Eaters behind him. Draco was immediately calling up a shield charm, but it was half a second too late.

The agony of the Cruciatus curse sent him to the floor, fighting back a scream and trying to remember, no matter what, to hold onto his wand. This was worse than he remembered. The fire that had raced over his body before had now turned into a molten lava being pumped through his veins, igniting every cell and nerve-ending. The Dark Lord had grown stronger with the aid of his Horcrux.

The pain overrode any thought, until he hardly remembered to breathe, but he could see Death Eaters approaching to apprehend him, and he couldn't afford to be caught.

He tried pushing past the pain, to form some sort of curse, but failed and fumbled for his necklace. He heard the Dark Lord shout in warning, but then he grasped his necklace and Portkeyed away.

The curse ended with his departure and he appeared in the front hall of the Order, lying in a crumpled mess. Footsteps came running, and then he was being helped up.

"Shit, Draco, you okay?" asked Bill. "You're bleeding. Where are you hurt?"

"I'm not," said Draco, pulling away and managing to stand on his own. "It's not my blood."

Bill stepped back. Draco could see several members of the Weasley family lingering in the dining room, staring at him.

"Draco," said Bill, his voice quiet and fearful. "Tell me you didn't."

Draco shrugged and pulled off his coat. A quick cleaning charm and the blood was gone. "She's not dead, if that's what you mean."

"Bellatrix," said Bill. "You went after her."

"Yeah, I did," said Draco, meeting Bill's gaze.

"But you didn't kill her."

Bill seemed to take that as a sign Draco had developed a heart of gold. He ruthlessly crushed that hope.

"It wasn't for lack of trying. I was interrupted; I'm sure she's been given the appropriate countercurses by now."

Bill looked startled, but then he stepped forward again. "Did she manage to hit you with a curse? You look pale."

"She didn't hit me with anything," said Draco. "She didn't have a wand."

"She didn't-," Bill repeated, before cutting himself off. He started again, voice stern, disapproving. "You were going to murder her," he said. "You wanted to murder her."

"Yes," said Draco.

Bill stared at him for a long moment. For the first time, Draco wasn't quite sure what the red-haired man was thinking. The hazel eyes were hard, Bill's expression was set. Bill finally jerked his head towards the stairs.

"Go take a shower, get cleaned up."

"What?" Draco scoffed. "No heart to heart, or meaningful talks?" His voice was sneering, far more disgusted than he intended, but his body was still aching from the curse, his hands were trembling with adrenaline and he had to clench his robes to keep them from being noticed.

"Right now I really don't want to talk to you," said Bill evenly. "It's late. I was up half the night worrying, because you didn't leave a note, and I didn't know if you were hurt or not, but now I see that I shouldn't have worried. You can take care of yourself, and you are perfectly capable of turning into Lucius no matter what I do, or how often I try to help, so no. No meaningful talks. I'm going to go relieve my wife who has been with a crying baby for half of the day and then get some sleep."

And Bill turned around and walked up the stairs. Draco stared after him, surprised and a little disconcerted. He waited for Bill to turn back, to heave a sigh but cave in and ask if he was alright. He waited, but Bill ascended the stairs without looking back. Draco was left standing in the hall, staring after him with a look of surprise on his face.

He did go upstairs though, because Harry and Ron and Mr. Weasley were staring at him from the dining room, disapproval and shock on their face. Draco was pretty sure there were others in the dining room as well, just as damning as Mr. Weasley was.

He didn't know how he managed to walk up to the third floor, and he was full-out shaking when he finally stumbled into the bathroom, but that was a perk to the third floor. Only the twins and Charlie shared this level, meaning that is was a private as one got in this house.

Draco turned on the shower until it was almost scalding and then fumbled to pull his clothes off. He stepped under the spray, not realizing how truly unsteady he really was until forced to stand on slick tile. He sat instead, because it was that or collapse after a few moments. He positioned himself directly under the water, feeling the heat slowly relax his muscles strained from the Cruciatus. His nerves still tingled, still randomly twinged in pain, but the water helped.

He reached for his ring and pulled it off, and the remains of the spells he used rushed out of him, leaving him gasping and feeling weaker than before, if that was possible. He took in a few measured breaths and then leaned his head against the cool, tile wall.

Bill's expression was called to mind. Was Bill disappointed with him, or just angry? But Bill never really understood what it was like to be a Malfoy. Family demanded retribution. Wouldn't Bill go after a Death Eater if Fleur was killed?

Of course he wouldn't. Bill would talk about it, maybe hunt the culprit down, but he couldn't see Bill actually murdering anyone. He would probably drag him in for a trial and persevere with his Gryffindor nobility and the support from his family.

But that didn't mean Bill could place his morality on Draco. He had no right to completely remove Draco from hundreds of years of traditions. Draco was a Malfoy.

Not anymore, said the voice in the back of his head, finally re-emerging after the night's activities. You chose not to be. You chose to fight with the Order. You have a greater responsibility now; you have a moral code to follow, to uphold.

Absolutely not, he argued. Where would the world be if no one decided to do the dirty work?

The voice was silent, because it didn't have to say anything. Already Draco's own, innate logic was countering the poor argument. Spying was one thing. Torturing a killer for information was flirting with the line, but murder? Was that really dirty work, or was it simply depraved? After all, that was how horcruxes were made, with intentional, premeditated murder.

Draco's soul was tainted, yes, but his was still intact. If he had killed, it was in battle, in self-defense. But killing a defenseless, wicked, insane woman? He could have become just like the Dark Lord. Or, as Bill had pointed out, his father.

Lucius was not a good man. He had his good moments, his good qualities, and 'enigma' was more of a fitting term than decidedly 'evil', but there were many things that Lucius was that Draco would be happier with out. Murderer was one of them.

Suddenly the feel of Bellatrix's hair in his fist came back to him. Of smashing her head into the table. Of her blood splashing onto him.

The brandy in his stomach churned and his muscles burned as he tensed with each, bloody memory until he was trembling again. One more thought, and this of his father, damned to the Kiss with no hope of rescue from the Dark Lord hit him, and he turned his head towards the drain and threw up. Just the brandy and bile came up, and then he shivered, turned the water hotter, and continued to sit.

o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

Bill didn't want to get up in the morning. Getting up would mean going downstairs, going downstairs would mean having to talk to Draco, and that was just an entire mess in itself.

He knew that Draco probably grew up with murder as common as the cold. Alright, so that was probably an exaggeration, but Lucius Malfoy was not an ideal role model. The Pureblood aristocracy was not a place to raise a child. The society was full of subterfuge and assassinations until all sense of the sacredness of any other life, outside of a family, was lost. Just look at Lucius Malfoy, willing to kill the Minister of Magic simply because the Dark Lord asked him to do so.

Bill didn't believe that Draco was such a degenerate. If anything, Draco had shown through his disavowal of Voldemort that he did hold some moral sense, but last night had proven that his morality was twisted and flexible.

Draco wasn't evil, Bill knew that. But there was a part of Draco that lusted for power, that could easily throw aside all ethics if it was for his gain. Draco's Boggart proved that Draco, while wary of that lurking presence, was no saint. Lord Draco had come out last night, and it had thrown Bill for a loop.

He had thought that Draco was doing better. That exposure to his family and the Order might help solidify some of those fledgling ethics into Draco. Maybe he had been blinded by his hope.

Or, said his rational voice, Draco is just a kid who was brought up to avenge his family, and not bat an eye at murder, and when confronted with the horror of having a parent sentenced to die, reacted in the way he was taught. A year isn't a lot of time to counter lessons from childhood, and Draco already has a lot to deal with for a teenager. Don't take it so personally.

Bill sighed and ran a hand over his face. The thought of Draco killing someone, even if she was a psychopath, was still disturbing. It wasn't to say he wouldn't condone her death. If, somehow, a jury could get hold of Bellatrix and sentence her to the Kiss, he would have to suppress the desire to celebrate. But he didn't want Draco to rip his own soul to get rid of a blight to humanity.

Bill got up, still unsure of how to approach Draco, so to stall, he took a long shower, but all too soon he was dressed and walking down the stairs. He hoped maybe the words would come once he saw Draco, something to show that he was upset, but in no way condemning Draco for the rules he was raised with, just a reminder that it wasn't the right way, or the best way.

Draco, though, wasn't at breakfast, nor was he in his study. Bill decided to at least have a coffee before going up to Draco's room, but halfway through his mug, Draco came down. He was wearing a dark suit and robes, and he looked a little pale, almost anxious.

"Are you alright, dear?" asked Mrs. Weasley.

Bill saw Draco glance over in surprise. The whole family had heard by now, heard how Draco had gone to kill Bellatrix. The concern was no doubt startling to him, and it was a little startling to Bill as well, but he was grateful for the kindness. Merlin knew Draco hadn't had enough of it in his life, and right now would be the wrong time to shun him.

"Yes," said Draco. "I'm fine, thank you." He glanced down, his fingers flew in their pattern, and then he looked up at Bill.

Bill waited, waited while Draco hesitated.

"I'm sorry," Draco said finally, his words nearly knocking Bill over in surprise. "I wasn't thinking," Draco continued. "I was angry and I shouldn't have…," he trailed off, and glanced down again.

Bill couldn't think of anything to say. He felt like now would be a good time to reassure Draco, to tell him it was alright, but he couldn't quite formulate the words in his head. He was going to make a lousy father if he couldn't even respond to an apology.

Draco took a breath, and then dragged his gaze back up to Bill. The grey eyes were troubled, and Bill was used to the expression, was used to seeing the storm inside, but there was something more to the conflict, an element he had only seen once, when Draco talked about his brother. Draco was grieving, and so his words surprised Bill.

"I'm going to go see Lucius."

Bill blinked. "You're what?"

Draco started speaking, the words coming out even, but quickly, rushed.

"The appeal will fall through this afternoon, and once that happens, they'll move Lucius to a more secure cell. They'll only allow visits through a magically enforced glass wall with at least five Aurors listening in to every word of the conversation and I would like to say goodbye without my words being analyzed and recorded for any future reference, or leaked and published to all of the radio stations in England."

"Wait," said Bill. "Goodbye? But you said yourself that Voldemort would never let Bellatrix have your father executed. You said he would get out."

"If the execution was Bellatrix's revenge, then yes, the Dark Lord would free him. But I became aware of some information last night. The Dark Lord has become tired of Lucius' less than enthusiastic service. The assassination was his plan, but so was Lucius' arrest. He ordered Bellatrix to testify; he won't break Lucius free."

Silence followed Draco's words. Everyone had thought, much like Draco, that Lucius Malfoy would never be held accountable for his actions, that he would never be reprehended. The idea that Lucius would be Kissed, that the Malfoy patriarch would fall…it was unthinkable.

"Sweet Merlin," said Mr. Weasley softly, but his inflection could neither be read as celebratory or sympathetic.

"It's the end of the Malfoy family," said Draco, an odd note in his voice. Regret or simply incredulity? He looked back to Bill.

"Will you come?" he asked.

Bill nodded, needing no time to think.

"Of course," he said.

o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

Ummm, so bad place to end, I know. I'm sorry. Also, I didn't edit this at all. Again, school is seriously kicking my butt right now. I've never been this busy. The good news is, next semester it will not be this busy. As for now, sorry for the delays. Please leave a review if you're scared for Lucius!





25. Difficult Goodbyes

Disclaimer: I can dream….

Author's note: Nope, I didn't die. I just suffered writers block, even though I knew what was going to happen. It seems odd, I know, but for some reason, I just couldn't get this chapter right. Then again, it does have Lucius in it, and all of the chapters with him are just a struggle. So, I apologize profusely for the wait.

oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo

Draco waited in his study for Bill to get ready. He gazed over all the work he had done, the runes spread across the table, the notes on the counter to Veritaserum, and Slytherin's knife and his own copy behind it on the bookcase. Suddenly, it all felt worthless. What did any of it matter?

He sat on the piano bench and stuffed his hands into his coat pockets. His coat was thick and long, but he was still cold. He stared at the floor.

The door swung open and Ginny entered, not bothering to knock. She didn't say a word, but simply sat next to him. After a moment, she slid closer and slipped her arm through his, leaning her head on his shoulder. She was the one leaning on him, but for some reason, he felt comforted. He pulled his hand out of his pocket and grabbed onto her fingers, wanting more of that contact.

"You're freezing," said Ginny, straightening and cupping both hands around his. He half-turned to keep them close, and breathed the scent of her hair. Lavender and vanilla, the shampoo she used this morning. Lavender was said to be a relaxant.

She reached up and brushed his hair away from his face.

"Ginny," he said.

She looked into his eyes, her own gaze gentle, full of….Her eyes were warm, and kind, and something more, something he equated with Lukas.

"Ginny, I screwed up," he said, to put a stop to that expression.

"I know," she said, and then she smiled softly, eyes still shining.

He wanted to draw back, wanted to turn away, but he couldn't.

"I might screw up again," he said. "What if I made another mistake and sprang Lucius from Azkaban?"

"Could you?" she asked.

"It probably wouldn't work."

"Are you going to?"

"What if I wanted to?"

"Draco, you can want to spring your father from prison. You're supposed to want to do those things for the ones you love."

"But what if I did?"

"Then I would understand. If you did, then you must have some reason to make it right."

"But I don't know what's right," said Draco, frustrated. "I don't have this sense of right and wrong like you. I wasn't taught to think of it."

"It's not what we're taught, it's what we know. You'll find, when the time comes, that you understand better than you think you do."

Draco shook his head. "I don't. It's all too new and it's…it's hard, and I don't think it should be." He looked over at her and raised a hand to tug lightly at a strand of her hair. "How do you do it?" he asked. She must know some secret. After all, she had the Dark Lord in her head for a time and still maintained her morality.

"I had a firm grounding in right and wrong when I was younger," she said. "But, I also learned the art of empathizing with others, putting myself in their position. It's just a little harder for you because you won't let yourself feel the way others do. You analyze too much and shut off your emotions and then don't understand when we don't do the same." She leaned closer. "You'll learn."

Draco rested his forehead against hers. "I think I'm past the age to acquire a conscience. You'll have to be that voice for me. Tell me when I don't understand; tell me what the rest of the world is feeling."

"Don't depend on me like that," said Ginny. "I'll just hold you back."

"Never," said Draco.

"Sometimes I think you put too much faith in me," said Ginny.

"And you expect the best from me far too often."

She gave him a measured look. "I remain completely unconvinced of that," she said. "You're not as bad as you would like to think you are, and until the day you murder hundreds of people based on fathers or hair color or clothing choice, I will always expect the best from you. You've just never had to be accountable to anyone else for your actions before. You excuse your behavior to yourself by twisting logic into any shape you want. That doesn't work here, not with us, but I will always have faith in you."

She smiled, and Draco, feeling incredibly weary but incredibly blessed in that moment, closed his eyes. Her hand brushed his hair, and then her lips pressed against his in a chaste, sweet kiss. Then her cheek was against his, and both her arms were around his neck, and he felt neither strangled or in danger. His arms encircled her waist.

Draco breathed in and then let it out slowly. He pressed every little detail into his memory, the scent of her hair, the warmth of her skin, the awkward angle he was sitting in, everything.

"You should probably go," Ginny said, after a moment, and he opened his eyes to stare at the study wall.

"Probably," he said.

She disengaged from the embrace and gave him a smile. She was always smiling at him. Maybe she though he would catch on after a while.

"You know what, Draco Malfoy?" she asked. Her smile was one part caring, two parts playful, as if she had a secret she wanted to tell. He would have been more suspicious, but her eyes were still warm.

"What?" he asked, when she waited for his response.

She leaned in to whisper in his ear.

"I love you," she said.

Draco froze and pulled back. If he looked blank, or startled, or perfectly terrified, she didn't react in anger. Instead, she grinned, kissed his cheek, and then left. He heard her footsteps stop in the hall, and then Bill's voice. He couldn't make out any words, but at that moment, he had other things on his mind.

He got up and walked over to his bookcase. His hand was drifting over the bindings of his dark collection of books when he heard Bill enter.

"Are you ready?" asked Bill.

Draco turned around and nodded. He followed Bill to the Floo.

Ginny had done a good job of distracting him, if that had been her intent of confessing right before he went to go see his father for the last time, which Draco believed it was. If it had been anyone other than Ginny, he wouldn't have believed the words because they were too convenient, but Ginny wouldn't lie. Not about this. Not about loving him. Loving him. The thought was a curious one. He knew that Bill thought of him as a brother, but this was different. Romantic love was more than affection, it was caring and devotion. It was a little bit of adoration.

He'd always thought it wasn't something to be wasted.

Draco spent the Portkey trip to the Ministry brewing over her words and even managed to ignore the suspicious stares of the Azkaban visitation officials. He filled out the visitation forms and answered their brief interrogation while staying passably polite. He and Bill relinquished their wands, and then it was another Portkey to the hidden, high security port which only had one dock, for the ferry to and from the island of Azkaban.

It was a cold day, dreary and grey, and if there was any more moisture in the air, it would be raining. Draco didn't pull out of his thoughts until they were on the boat, and then, as if a switch were thrown, nothing could keep his mind from Lucius.

He sat on the bench towards the prow of the boat. There was a covered seating area behind the captain's wheel, but spells and charms kept even Draco's seat warm and free from sea spray. Even if there weren't any spells, Draco wouldn't sit inside the enclosure. Four Azkaban guards were sitting in that area, along with two Aurors and another undercover Auror, disguised as a visitor, but Draco saw right through her affected mood of mourning.

Bill was speaking with the captain of the ferry now. Through it all, he had remained a silent, but supportive companion. Draco was grateful for the silence, and the grey skies that kept the Aurors and guards indoors.

He looked out over the water, iron grey and choppy, rising up in short angry bursts. The wind had picked up over the sea, and was whipping around the boat, but nothing more than a cold, salty draft snuck through the shielding charms.

Bill came back and reclaimed the seat next to him.

"Ten more minutes," he said.

Draco nodded, just to show he had heard him. Bill looked out at the water for a moment, but then turned back.

"Draco," he said, for the first time initiating the heart-to-heart Draco was hoping to avoid, "you don't have to do this. The minute you want to leave, we can. You are in no way obligated to see him."

"Aren't I?" Draco mused, not responding to Bill completely but merely considering the question.

"No," said Bill firmly.

Draco's lip quirked at the staunch support, but humorlessly.

"If this is going to…unduly upset you," said Bill, "then by no means should you go. He…I don't know if he deserves that sacrifice on your part."

"I'm not going to do drugs," said Draco. "If that's what you're referring to. I sincerely doubt any of you are going to even let me leave the house unattended for the foreseeable future."

Bill may have whispered something along the lines of 'damn straight we aren't' under his breath. Draco didn't call him on it and turned back to the water.

"Do you love him?" Bill asked suddenly.

Draco didn't answer, but he frowned in thought.

"I'm sorry," said Bill. "It's not my place to interfere."

"I'm not angry at the question," said Draco, "I'm just thinking."

If he had to think to answer, did that mean he didn't?

"It's okay to be confused about it," said Bill, proving that he was far too attuned to Draco's thoughts.

"Yes," said Draco. "I love him and I hate him, if that's possible."

"Very possible," said Bill. "And, in your case, I would say very understandable."

Draco nodded. "I don't want him to go this way. It would be better if he was killed, but this?" He shook his head. "The Dementors should have never been used in this way. It's inhumane and a disgrace. The body can live for years after the Kiss, like an animal, unable to think, only able to react. Brain damage, that's what the Kiss does, that's what happens when the soul is ripped away, and I can't…it's wrong. I can't have it this way."

He was still looking to the water, but glanced over when Bill touched his arm.

"I'm sorry," said Bill. "I wish… I wish I could tell you it would all be okay."

If it was all okay, it wouldn't be his life.

The boat was carefully guided into the small harbor five minutes later. The lone pier was long, housing a guard station at both ends and numerous security wards. The passengers unloaded single file, and then walked to the security detail that blocked their entrance to the prison. There were eight guards there, twice the number usually present, and the additional four from the boat. Draco and Bill, and the undercover Auror, were instructed to step through a sensory portal, which would scan them for any weapons or illegal wands.

Apparently the guards weren't entirely satisfied, because they checked Draco with additional spells and then had him place his hands on the wall and frisked him the Muggle way, patting down his waist, legs and arms.

"Seriously?" he heard Bill ask. "He's a seventeen year old kid, and there are twelve of you. Is this entirely necessary?"

The guards didn't pay him any mind, but Draco finally passed their examination.

"Alright," said the oldest guard. "This way."

Four guards led them to the prison, the rest bringing up the rear in an odd sort of processional. The visitor entrance was right off the pier, through a door and down a tall stone hallway, lit by windows twenty feet up the wall.

It was a dismal, stark welcome, but it brought relief from the biting wind. There were heating charms here, but although Draco could feel the warmth on his skin, a chill had seized his heart. It was a gradual feeling, starting when the boat had reached the harbor, but it came on so slowly it was easy to mistake it for the biting wind. Once inside, it became obvious that it was more than cold. It was dread and fear. This was the influence of the Dementors.

The Dementors were not allowed in this section of the prison, but there were no wards against the despair that trickled from their black hoods. With recent events, mainly the attack on the Ministry, less than half of the creatures remained, but a worry still toyed with the edges of Draco's mind. His heart beat faster; his fists clenched.

Draco and Bill were led into the waiting room, which offered a few chairs and the walls were painted pale blue. It must have been an attempt at cheer, but with the affect of the Dementors, the blue appeared to be the color of ice.

Upon entry, a guard brought over the visitors' cloaks for Draco and Bill and the plainclotheswoman. They were canary yellow, which served to keep the visitors clearly marked, but also functioned as protection against the Dementors. Warming charms were woven through the fabric, alongside strong cheering spells. The guard's uniforms were even more protected, but even so, no guard worked more than eight hours a day.

Draco wrapped the cloak around him, unable to despise the color when the relief it brought was tangible. Not complete, but comforting.

They waited a few moments before the door leading to the cells opened. The Head Warden stood there, casting an assessing gaze over Draco and Bill. He had, of course, been forewarned of the visit before they had boarded the ferry.

"All settled then?" he asked.

"Yes," said Draco.

"Follow me," said the Warden.

Draco did, Bill trailing behind. Six guards and one Auror followed. The Warden led them through a locked and warded door and down another hallway. They passed through two more doors, which scanned them yet again, and then they ascended a curved, stone staircase to the second floor.

Here, the most dangerous criminals were kept, cold-blooded assassins and crazed serial-murderers. The hallway was wide, well lit, and on one side, it was possible to see into the cells. There were no bars or doors, like in Muggle prisons. Instead, a barrier of pure magic acted as a fourth wall. The guards could see in, but the prisoners could not see out. The barrier, from the cell, would feel and act like another stone wall.

Draco stared as he walked past, recognizing the occupants from newspapers. Some were sprawled in the middle of their cells, their mouths open in screams that did not breach the magic wall. Others were huddled on filthy mattresses, covering their ears, rocking back and forth. Some were crazed, running around, faces red from noiseless shouts, tearing at their hair and ragged robes.

The Warden stopped at the very last cell. For a moment, Draco didn't want to look inside, afraid of what he might see, but he swallowed and pushed the emotions aside. He lifted his head.

Lucius Malfoy was not behaving like the other prisoners; he was seated at a desk his power and influence had allowed him to acquire. He also had a real bed. Each item, of course, was specifically crafted to be tamperproof, made without joints or hinges so that no part of it could be broken off and used as a weapon.

"Twenty minutes," said the Warden, turning to look at Draco and Bill. "Wards will only let one person through at a time." He pulled two keys out of his pocket. "These will let you through the wards on either side. If you break it," he mimed snapping it in half, "it will bring you right back here in a second. Only use it last case scenario though. The ride isn't a pleasant one, if you catch my meaning."

These Portkeys would take travelers through impenetrable wards. Unpleasant would be an understatement, but he assumed, if one was being attacked by a crazed resident of Azkaban, it would no doubt be a better alternative. Draco reached out and then pocketed the key. Bill took one as well and then turned to Draco.

"Do you want me to go in with you?" he asked.

Draco glanced over at the cell, then back at Bill. He shook his head.

"No, I'll be fine."

Bill nodded. "Just don't let him get to you. You don't have to stay. Come right back out if you need to."

"I'll be fine, Bill," Draco said again, more firmly this time.

"Right," said Bill.

Draco turned to the cell and then walked purposefully towards the wards, not hesitating until he reached the barrier. The wards were thick, and moving through them was like moving through molasses. The air was pressed tight and stale, there was a faint buzzing in his ears, and it was almost warm inside, warm with a cloying scent that made Draco want to sneeze.

He finally pushed through the last of the wards, staggering a little when he stepped into thin air and not the heavy, pressing charms. His eyes flickered over the room once, taking in further details of the room. It was larger than one would think a prison cell would be, to give the Aurors maneuvering space in case of a difficult prisoner, and the furniture was magically sealed to the ground. Even the chair at the desk was melded to the floor. The room was lit by sunlight through the long, skinny windows at the very top of the wall, and by an indestructible glow-sphere on the desk. It, too, was bolted down.

Lucius was sitting at the desk when Draco entered. He had a few loose pieces of parchment in front of him and a quill that would spontaneously combust if it touched anything other than the parchment and the prisoner's hand. His father slowly, very slowly, looked over.

Draco suddenly wondered if this was a good idea. From this side, the wall made up of wards looked convincingly like a stone wall, and he felt a stir of claustrophobia brought on by the blank look in his father's eyes.

Lucius had been blank before, unreadable in his non-expression, but even then, there was a presence about Lucius, a direction. Now, the grey eyes were vacant, as if Lucius had retreated so far into himself, nothing was left.

His physical appearance had suffered as well. He was wearing thick, expensive robes (even in prison, Lucius was commanding), but the cloth simply hung on his frame, loose and drab. His hair, which normally shone with golden light, was white, still brushed and tidy, but flat. There were lines on his face and shadows under his eyes.

Anyone else might not notice the changes, or at least, require a good deal of study before picking them out, but to Draco, they were glaring. For one brief moment, Draco was unable to equate this man to his father.

Lucius now regarded him with those lost, blank eyes, and shaken, Draco spoke.

"Lucius."

The grey eyes sparked with recognition, and suddenly Lucius was there in the cell with him. Draco would have been relieved, but the spark was still in his father's eyes. It wasn't the look Draco was used to seeing directed at him. It wasn't a fond glance, or even an arrogant snub. It was the look a malicious man would give a worm on his path, the look Lucius gave to countless men before he destroyed them for insulting him.

"Well, look who has come to visit," said Lucius, his mouth spreading in a predatory smile.

Draco tried not to flinch at that smile.

"No doubt you think well of yourself, Dragon," Lucius continued, "for splitting with the Malfoy name just in time to avoid the scandal, but tell me, was it the Gryffindors' idea to come and gloat? It breaks my preconceived notions of the golden house, but it seems I have been wrong about a great many things this past week."

Draco took a step back because the look in Lucius' eyes had only grown in intensity, and because admitting to failings was something Lucius had never done before. He knew that the continued presence of Dementors, even with only half of the number remaining, would be enough to shake Dumbledore himself, but he hadn't thought his father was susceptible. Lucius, in his mind, had always been invincible.

He considered responding, but his brain seemed to have missed a connection. Lucius rose from his chair, an unknown intent in his movement.

"Of course, you would have known of the betrayal far before it happened. Genius, you say." Lucius curled his lip. "I've seen your genius, boy. Don't forget, even as you slander the Malfoy name to promote your reformed agenda, I was the one who raised you, who taught you how to succeed. Remember that when you lead Dumbledore's army in the name of righteousness. You are no saint. Your hands are still tainted."

Lucius must be unbalanced, but malevolence lent his voice a smooth hypnosis. He had always been eloquent, and his anger only thrilled his words.

"Dark magic still runs in your blood, no matter how many virginal Gryffindors' you bed. Were you hoping, after my demise, to find a place among the Weasley paupers? You have to understand you will never belong with them. I've made sure of that, boy. You had no one in an entire palace except myself. Did you think you could replace me so easily?"

Lucius advanced, and rather than step back through the wards, Draco side-stepped, but Lucius still closed in on him. Draco retreated until his back hit the stone wall, and still Lucius pressed in, trapping him against the wall without making physical contact.

Draco knew, right then, that he must have been insane to visit his father. Did he think a death sentence would endear him to his father? Lucius never forgot, and never forgave. Draco had betrayed him, and now he was taking his vengeance.

"What was it you were hoping to achieve by your visit?" Lucius inquired, almost genially. "Was it a portion of your inheritance? Raising an army is an expense not many people can afford. Are you the financier for Dumbledore's mission? Or did you simply wish to reclaim the house you called home and relive the days you drowned in luxury? It won't be yours, Draco. Did you think I would give it to you, a prize for the prodigal son?"

Now Lucius' hand clasped his jaw, tipping his face up, the grip tightening painfully until he looked into those cold grey eyes.

"The only thing I give you is the knowledge that the Malfoy name will be redeemed. Once the lands are in the possession of the Dark Lord, the glory of the family will be restored, but you will be struck from every book, and every history. All those who knew you will perish, and you, you will be forced to remember me. For every day of the remainder of your life, you will remember your betrayal of the name you still hold, but when tomorrow comes, I will no longer think of you. That is what I give you now, Draco, a memory to torment your nights and to haunt your days. And I will be free of you."

The last was punctuated with a shove, not hard, just enough to snap Draco out of his terrified silence. Lucius pulled his hands away as if disgusted and stepped back.

"Get out," he ordered in a hiss.

Draco pushed himself from the wall, hand rising to reach out.

"Father," he said, the word slipping out without thought. "I didn't…," Draco stepped forward, needing Lucius to understand he wasn't here for any monetary gain, but it was difficult to find words, and his voice caught awkwardly. "Father, I haven't… please."

The last slipped through when Lucius turned away. Desperation bled through his voice, and he clamped his mouth shut, biting off anything else that might slip from his lips, but it caused Lucius to pause.

"Draco," said a new voice, and Draco turned to see Bill, just stepped through from the wards, a steely look on his face. "Draco," said Bill again, "don't you dare apologize to that man."

oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo

Bill had watched as Draco confronted his father, unable to hear what was said. It appeared Lucius was doing all of the talking, stalking forward, expression cold and terrifying, and Draco, the most fearless person he knew, nearly back straight into the wards. But Draco turned, and now Bill could see both profiles. Draco wasn't responding, staring at Lucius with widen, but guarded, eyes.

Lucius grabbed Draco's jaw, and suddenly Bill was afraid for the boy. Draco had the portkey; why wasn't he using it?

"Shit," said the Warden. "Is he insane?"

"I'm going in," said Bill.

"Absolutely not," said the Warden, but Bill hadn't been looking for permission. He was already stepping into the wards, fighting his way through as Lucius shoved Draco. He was relieved to see Malfoy step back, an expression of disgust twisting his features, and suddenly he was angry. He was more than angry; he was outraged. How dare he look at Draco in that way? He forced his way into the cell to hear Draco plead, "Father, I haven't…please."

He had never heard Draco so vulnerable, not when he was sick in the infirmary, not when he had a bloody hole through his arm, not even when he was crashing from an overdose of Angel-Flight. It made his fists clench.

"Draco," he said, causing the boy to look over. "Draco, don't you dare apologize to that man."

He glared at the Malfoy patriarch, who stared back with a look of non-interest. Bill stepped over to Draco's side and put an arm on his shoulder.

"Let's go," he said. "You don't need to be here."

He tried guiding Draco back to the wards, but Draco turned with a cold stare.

"Draco, no," said Bill.

Draco shook his head, not answering in words, but Bill had seen that look before. It was one of utmost resolve. Knowing there was no use in arguing, Bill let him go with a sigh.

"He doesn't deserve this," he stated, completely matter-of-fact. He withdrew to the side of the cell and leaned against the wall, crossing his arms over his chest. "I'm not leaving though."

The corner of Draco's mouth twitched at his stubbornness, and he gave a small smile in return. He watched as Draco turned to his father once more, and for a full minute there was silence, both assessing each other, the tension rising. When Draco finally spoke, it was simply and in a calm voice.

"Your appeal won't go through," he said. "That's why I'm here now, before you're moved. I wouldn't have anyone else listening."

Lucius raised one eyebrow, the way Bill had seen Draco do so many times.

"Bill's a friend," said Draco, answering the expression.

There was silence again, less strained this time. Bill watched Draco's fingers tap against each other in a blur.

"I spoke with Aunt Bella, which is how I know," said Draco. "Spoke with doesn't quite cover the entire conversation, and I had to leave suddenly, so certain words weren't said. Now that I'm removed from the meeting, I've decided not to pursue another encounter. You may or may not understand my reasons."

Well, that was the most roundabout, vague way to say he had nearly killed his aunt for vengeance. Bill wondered, if he hadn't known the story, if he would have been able to deduce the true happenings. He would like to think yes, but the delivery had been so calm, so noncommittal, it was hard to believe Draco was speaking about murder.

"You forget with whom you speak," said Lucius. "I always understand, in the end."

There was meaning behind the older Malfoy's words, Bill knew that much, but what else did Lucius understand? Did he finally figure out that Draco was here to say goodbye?

Draco, for his part, looked strangely relieved at those words. His fingers slowed their pattern.

"Then you know," he said. "I never left you, just him."

Apparently in the Malfoy family, sub-subtext was a language they all spoke fluently.

"Can you really describe it as such?" asked Lucius in a hard voice.

"I kept the name!"

It wasn't quite a declaration from Draco, but they had been speaking in such cool, flat tones, that this little bit of inflection was nearly akin to a shout.

Draco continued, still speaking in that almost-impassioned tone.

"You refused to define yourself separately from him. There was no room for disagreement with him."

"We shared the same ideals."

"Don't take me for a fool. You could suffer through a reign of Muggle-borns if it was beneficial to you. This was your easiest way to power, and it was only an additional advantage that the both of you were Pureblood traditionalists."

"Don't take me for a simpleton. I had many reasons, ones that I have not discussed with you, nor is it necessary to explain them now. Not everyone is blessed with the fearless idiocy a supreme intellect apparently brings. He is a powerful man with great plans."

"But you know his plans are flawed, better than most. Did you expect me to follow without question?"

"I expected a little more faith."

"Well maybe I wasn't indoctrinated enough as a child," said Draco, a note of definite derision creeping into his voice.

"Is that why you're here?" asked Lucius, and he appeared to be amused at this new development. "To place the blame where it lies, to call me out on being an absent father? One final act of rebellion before there's no one left to rebel against?"

Bill saw Draco visibly catch himself from retorting. It seemed the Weasley temper was rubbing off on him, not that he didn't have a temper before, but he was usually so reserved. It was either that, or the seeping chill from the Dementors was etching away at his defenses. Even with the cloak, Bill still felt uneasy, vaguely fearful, though for no reason he could pinpoint. Bill wondered how Lucius Malfoy was still coherent.

Draco let out a soft breath. "No," he said. "I'm not here for that."

The warded wall cleared for one moment, and the Warden raised his hand in the five minute gesture. Bill saw Draco's eyes flicker. Five more minutes, and then Draco would never see Lucius again.

Bill would have said that was a good thing, if the whole 'never see Lucius again' wasn't paired with Lucius death, or rather, the sucking of his soul. He would have preferred a life sentence, or an exile. Still permanent, just less traumatic.

Bill saw Draco glance down, swallowing hard. He wanted to say something, or put his arm around the kid as it was obvious Lucius would do nothing to comfort his own son, his only child.

"I-," Draco started, but his voice caught. He took a breath a forged on. "I wanted to say to you before…before you…"

Again Draco stopped. Bill saw him turn his head, his mouth twisting with the words that wouldn't form. One pale hand was raised to run through his hair, completely ruffling the white-blond locks.

"Merde," Draco whispered, so softly he might have only mouthed the word.

Bill looked to Lucius but he should have realized the Malfoy patriarch would be infinitely harder to read than Draco. All he could tell was that Lucius was listening. His gaze was locked onto Draco's face and he was completely still except for the silent breaths he took.

Draco glanced to Bill, just for a split-second, and then he turned back to Lucius.

"There were things I wanted to tell you," he said. "Things that I could say years from now, but not today. It's too soon." His voice was strong, and colored with regret, but unapologetic. Bill felt a surge of pride for him in that moment.

"You were right," Draco continued. "I only had you when I was younger, and you made yourself completely irreplaceable." Now his voice grew strained. "Does that give you satisfaction, Lucius? Even now, when I'm finally getting things right for the first time in my life, there's still you. Is that what you need to hear before you die? That I can struggle for salvation and still need your blessing?"

Bill wondered if Draco would be crying now if he had the ability. His voice was rough, and he was swallowing hard. Perhaps knowing he couldn't cry allowed him a sense of freedom, allowed him to be freer with his emotions because they would never culminate in tears. Or perhaps it was the Dementors that had him so unhinged.

Perhaps he was simply a teenage boy telling his father goodbye.

"I kept the name," said Draco, voice soft, "I kept the name because I wanted to keep you."

Draco held his father's gaze.

"I don't want you to die."

The statement sounded young, but then again, Draco wasn't very old. Bill saw Lucius' grey eyes lighten, almost imperceptibly. Draco cast one glance to the warded wall, and then he stepped forward, quickly, as if he was afraid he would lose his nerve, and he wrapped his arms around his father.

Bill dropped his gaze at the fumbled, stilted embrace, but he couldn't help but watch out of his peripheral vision. After the initial hesitation and falter, Draco clung to his father, his face buried in the silk robes Lucius was apparently allowed to wear.

Draco didn't hold on for long, just long enough for Lucius to raise his own hands. He didn't pull his son closer, or push him away, his hands simply pressed once on Draco's shoulders.

Draco took a step back, eyes flickering to Lucius' face, and then he turned for the warded wall. He took two steps away from his father.

"Draco," said Lucius, stopping his progress for one moment. Bill watched, hoping that he might say something that would make this whole ordeal worthwhile to Draco. He wasn't expecting an 'I love you', but something along those lines would be nice.

"I never needed another child," Lucius said.

Bill felt, as heart-warming farewells went, the words were sorely lacking, but he saw Draco's face, and saw the softening of the expression, the faint tilt of the lips. He supposed, in Malfoy-speak, it might be the equivalent to 'I care for you'.

Draco didn't respond, but took one more step into the wards, pushing his way through. Bill could see his progress and it looked as if he was melting through solid stone. He would be stuck here, with Lucius Malfoy, for another minute or so.

He wasn't expecting a conversation, but he could feel Lucius' gaze on him and had to turn. Lucius' stare didn't waver. His eyes were narrowed, but Bill didn't feel it was supposed to be a threat. The grey eyes, so like Draco's, slid away in dismissal.

"I can see why he trusts you," said Lucius indifferently. "You remind me of someone I once knew."

"Lukas," said Bill, but Lucius gave no reaction to the name. "Draco told me that once."

There was a short pause, then, "I suppose you're proud of yourself for interfering in his life."

"He's an amazing young man," said Bill. "I count myself lucky to be a part of his life."

His dig at Lucius' absence only earned him a bemused sort of condescension. Bill wished the wards weren't quite so thick. Lucius was starting to irritate to him.

"I suppose," Lucius drawled, "as Gryffindors, you'll have to look after him. He is the only chance you have, after all."

Was that a request to look after Draco? Bill didn't think much of Lucius after this past encounter, but he remembered that Lucius had done some good for his son. Still, Bill was of the opinion that if the person you loved didn't know that you did, it really didn't do any good for anyone involved.

His lack of response caused Lucius to turn, and suddenly the grey eyes were narrowed in the promise of pain. Draco's gaze, while intimidating, had lost most of its effect on Bill. Seeing the original, directed solely at him, was terrifying. Bill straightened, holding up his hands in a placating gesture. Well, that was a clear sign Lucius did care.

"We'd look after him even if he was an average student," he promised.

Lucius snorted and leaned back against the wall, apparently satisfied at his response.

"He would never be ordinary. He's a Malfoy."

Bill raised his eyebrows, because Lucius had been the one to disown Draco, but the Malfoy patriarch was no longer interested in him. He was watching Draco's form gradually disappear through the wards with a furrowed brow.

"It is curious," Lucius Malfoy mused, once Draco was completely out of sight, safe on the other side, "I had thought, when the arrest came, that I was ready to leave this world, but now… now I find that this is not a time of my choosing."

It was curious. Bill had no idea what he meant, and with one last, puzzled look, he stepped into the wards.

oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

I'm really sorry about the wait. However, I have broken from my funk, and writing again, speedily. Well, not exactly speedily, but at a steady pace. So, I'll try for next week, and if not then, definitely in two weeks. If I don't, feel free to throw things at me, or leave angry messages. Please leave a review! And, next chapter, we find out what happens to Lucius. Excited? I am! (grins)





26. Death Can Be a Form of Rescue

Disclaimer: I love men with white-blond hair. I own none.

Author's note: Um, I'm two hours late. Sorry about that. I also apologize for the tears this chapter may cause.

oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo

Draco had to force himself to wait for Bill outside his father's cell, and once the red-haired man emerged, he started down the hall, not even waiting for the guards and not slowing when the Warden called for him to stop for the escort. The guards had to run to catch-up, but Bill simply fell into step beside him, not asking any questions.

Draco didn't waste any time in the prison, pausing at the exit only long enough to return the yellow cloak and give a cursory nod of thanks to the Warden. Then he was outside, striding down the pier for the ferry.

Once he had taken off the cheering cloak, the choking presence of the Dementors hit him full blast. It was all he could do not to shiver. By the time they reached the ferry, his muscles were fully tensed to the point of trembling, but it was the only thing holding him together. He walked to the prow of the boat again, avoiding the guards and undercover Auror. He needed privacy and space.

He very nearly collapsed onto the bench that ran along the sides of the ferry, and then he gripped the edge of the seat and held on with white knuckles. Bill didn't say anything, not until the ferry finally started and pulled away from the island prison. With each second, the freezing pressure slowly eased, and when Azkaban was fading from sight, Draco took in a deep, shuddering breath. He pried his hands from the bench, but they were shaking, so he grabbed back on and tried to take another breath.

"Draco," said Bill. "Are you-?"

"Not now," Draco cut him off. "Just…don't. Not now, please." His voice was desperate.

"What can I do?" asked Bill.

Draco clamped his mouth shut on a cold, unsteady laugh. "Talk to me," he said. "Distract me."

"What do you want to talk about?" asked Bill.

"I don't know," said Draco. "What about Snape? He was supposed to set up a potions lab in the basement of the Order before Christmas. Where do you think he's been?"

Bill looked quite taken off-guard. "Um, maybe he's working with Dumbledore on something?"

"We were going to work on the counter for Veritaserum. Not much is more important than that," said Draco. He shook his head. "He must be working with the Dark Lord then. But what would keep him that long? Unless, of course, the Dark Lord is purging his troops, which would make sense. He's regained his strength, and now has to turn his attention to his army. Fudge, before he was killed, was starting to gather intelligence on his movements. He can't take any risks. He probably has Snape working on Veritaserum and holding interrogations." He was rambling, the words spilling out of his mouth. Vocalizing his thoughts was one of the best ways to keep his mind occupied.

"But he'd make Snape take the serum too, wouldn't he?" asked Bill, frowning in concern.

Draco scoffed. "A master like Snape would easily be able to taint his own dose of Veritaserum. Still, it's been long, even for a purging. He must be bringing in his recruits from Europe as well, consolidating his forces and sources of revenue."

"I thought he'd be working on getting his horcrux," said Bill.

"Even he has to research. Fifteen years is a long time to track a thief. If he's purging his troops, it means he's planning an offensive. Probably right after he does find his horcrux. Tierney will keep the Aurors away from the Death Eaters, and keep the country unprepared for an attack."

"So what do we do?" asked Bill. His questions helped Draco stayed focused on the topic at hand.

"Get Tierney out of the Ministry. It'll be hard, but not impossible. He thinks he has more support in the Dark Lord than he actually does. The Dark Lord never needed him. He's useful, not irreplaceable. Now that Lucius-,"

Draco cut himself off, because that was one trouble with trying to distract himself from his father. Everything seemed to come back to him. He sucked in a quick breath, Bill leaned forward, but then he was talking again, words tripping out.

"I mean, the Dark Lord was going to get what he could out of Tierney, but keeping him in office might prove to be too much effort. The Dark Lord isn't – you know, that's a really stupid name. 'The Dark Lord'. It's a proper title, did you know that? Someone who was versed in the dark arts could claim it, and most of them never used the dark magic for evil purposes. They would be called in for certain situations, werewolves, vampires, medical emergencies sometimes, you know, that sort of stuff. They stopped using it a few hundred years ago when the Dark Lord Toroth started a small war in the Austrian region. He made the title rather unpopular."

"Understandable," said Bill.

"And now Voldemort has to go ruin it again. I could claim the title dark lord, pull some of that prestige from him. That would piss him off, don't you think?"

"I don't think you need to do anything more to piss him off."

Draco gave a harsh laugh. "Probably true. Next time he sees me he might throw the Avada and not just a crucio. Wouldn't be able to Portkey from that one, would I? Of course, if I rigged the Portkey to activate at the presence of an Unforgiveable, I-,"

"Draco, do you mean to say that Voldemort hit you with the Cruciatus last night?" asked Bill, obviously startled and concerned.

Draco hadn't meant to let that slip, but now that it was out, he couldn't bring himself to care enough to backtrack. "Just for a second," he said.

"Draco," said Bill again, in a very even tone of voice, "do you realize that right now you're shivering so hard it's a miracle you're staying on your seat?"

Draco looked down, confused, thinking that he had himself under control, but he was still trembling, wasn't he? He pulled his hands from the edge of the bench and held them up. His hands were shaking uncontrollably.

"Is this because of the Cruciatus?" asked Bill.

"I don't-," Draco started, too startled to think, but then he grabbed onto his coat and tried to clear his mind. "The body's reaction to the Cruciatus curse is to flood the brain with endorphins. It helps block the pain and calm the nerves. The presence of the Dementors prevents the release of endorphins, creating a 'crash' or a withdrawal of sorts."

"Is that a yes?"

"It's just a slight reaction. From too much to block the remaining effects of the Cruciatus to none at all. Now my brain is trying to find a balance. Can't settle down."

The truth was, the Cruciatus normally wore off after a matter of hours, and surely twelve hours later, the brain shouldn't need to keep releasing endorphins, but the Dark Lo – Voldemort was stronger than the average wizard now. Hell, he was probably stronger than Dumbledore. Allowing for extra recovery time, yes, the Dementors would have affected him, but it shouldn't be by this much. He should feel unsettled, maybe frightened. He shouldn't be shaking.

It must be shock, that was the only explanation. Even those emotionally detached could feel strong emotions, they just didn't know what to do with them.

"Are you in pain? Do you need to go to St. Mungo's?"

Draco shook his head. "No, it'll just take a while longer to calm down. I'll be fine in a few minutes."

"You sure?"

"Yeah."

And he did, gradually, stop shaking. By the time the ferry reached the harbor, his body had calmed, and only a faint tremor shook him when he moved to fast. The Portkey from the harbor took them to the Ministry where they retrieved their wands, and then they Flooed through to the Order Headquarters.

Draco tried not to become attached to places. They were physical settings that couldn't always guarantee protection or harbor, but when he saw the old wall-papered walls, and breathed in the scent of lily and cinnamon (Mrs. Weasley was undoubtedly cooking, and there were lily-scented candles in the kitchen and living room), he felt safe. The outside world couldn't reach him here.

But you're still here, said the voice of Lord Draco in his head. You've brought the world with you. Did you think you could simply forget what you had done?

"-co? Draco, are you alright?"

Draco jerked his head up. Sirius, Harry and Ron were at the dining room table, a game of wizard's chess between them, Sirius obviously on Harry's team. The question hadn't come from them though. Mrs. Weasley had peeked in from the kitchen and she looked a little concerned.

"I'm fine, thanks," said Draco. He immediately regretted the last word, because Harry and Ron exchanged a look. Sirius got up from the table and went into the kitchen.

"Do you need any tea, dear?" Mrs. Weasley asked. "Or some hot chocolate? You look a little pale."

"Well, nothing new then," said Ron.

Draco actually appreciated the bit of levity. It was normal. He wanted normal so he could push the day away.

"I'm fine," he repeated, skipping the 'thanks' this time.

Sirius came back with a small glass of whiskey.

"I don't think," Bill started, but Sirius was already passing it off to Draco.

Draco downed the glass in a long swallow, welcoming the burn down his throat. He put the empty glass on the table.

"I'm going to my room," he said.

He walked up the stairs, not really able to move any faster. He was still cold and still a little shaky. When he finally got to his room, he let the door swing shut and collapsed face first on his bed. He rolled to his side and stared at the wall, curled up, hands close to his chest and gripping each other. His nails dug into his skin. What had he done?

Nothing I haven't, said Lord Draco.

'Shut up,' he told himself. 'Shut up!'

His hands went to his head.

That's not going to help, said Lord Draco.

Draco pressed his hands tighter against his temples.

Oh, come now, don't be shy, said Lord Draco.

Draco clenched his jaw, trying to force the voice out of his head, but he had always been his best tormentor. He closed his eyes when they stung and swallowed when pressure rose in his throat.

You don't have the right to cry, even if you could. Look what you did!

Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shu-

"Draco?"

Draco started and turned towards the door. Ginny was standing there, her hair in loose curls falling around her face and over her shoulders. She was wearing a white sweater. She could have been an angel.

"I knocked," she said. "But you didn't…are you alright?"

Draco nodded, and took in a breath to speak, but the air rushed in with a gasp, and then Ginny was beside him, sitting on the bed next to him. Her hands were soft against his face, and then he turned to her, wanting to hold her, but hesitating. She pressed herself to him, resting her head against his chest and reaching her arms around him. He gently placed his hands on her and then held tight. The voice in his head fell silent.

oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo

Bill was exhausted, and it wasn't even his own father he had visited as Azkaban. It was no wonder the kid had been shaking on the trip back. That, and the revelation that he just may have had a brush with Voldemort the night before and gotten crucioed of all things. Was he the only one that felt that certain piece of information should have been shared?

He sat at the kitchen table, sipping at a cup of hot chocolate. He wanted to do nothing more than head up to his room and hold his son and kiss his wife, but he wanted to have a semblance of control before he did so. He still felt a bit cold.

So he finished his cocoa, and helped Harry and Sirius finally win a game of chess against Ron, and even then it was only because Ron started the game with half of his pieces. Apparently that was the only way Ron found the game even remotely exciting anymore.

He then went upstairs to the 'nursery'.

Fleur was sitting on their bed, sketches and swatches of cloth placed out over the duvet. She smiled when he came in and Bill quickly shut the door so he could indulge in a heated kiss with his wife.

"Mmm," said Fleur, when their lips finally parted. "What brought that on?"

"I'm so glad to be back," said Bill. "I'm so glad I have you." He leaned in again, letting this meeting of lips progress as slowly as he could stand. He pulled away only to check on Lukas who was sleeping in his crib.

He reached out to run a light finger over his cheek. Even in his sleep, the infant turned towards the touch, his tiny, cupid's lips sucking against each other.

"Don't wake him up," Fleur whispered. "He just got to sleep."

"I won't," Bill promised quietly. He retucked the blanket around him and then walked back to his wife, toeing off his shoes and sitting on the bed behind her. She leaned back against his chest, holding up two cloth squares and a picture.

"Which one?" she asked.

Bill looked at the sketch and then at the material. He honestly had no idea, but he pointed to the light blue.

"That one."

"You just like blue."

"You should have known I'd be biased."

"I like it too," said Fleur. She picked up a quill and then pulled up her legs so that she could make a note on the page, using her leg as a table. Her full weight was resting against Bill now. It felt right.

Bill leaned in, nuzzling her neck and then pressing a row of kisses across her creamy skin.

"Stop that," said Fleur, mock-scolding him. "I have work to do."

"You shouldn't be so distracting then," said Bill. He reached out, running a hand across her stomach, her skin blocked by the lilac shirt she was wearing. He found the hem and slipped his hand under, and then his fingers were there, skimming across warm, smooth skin. She was so soft.

"I have to get this set planned by the end of the week, Bill," Fleur warned him.

His hand slid up.

"Bill!" Fleur admonished in a whisper. "Lucas is asleep!"

"So we'll just have to be quiet then," said Bill. He nibbled at her earlobe. "I've missed you."

"I've been right here."

"You've been busy."

"So have you."

"You said no sex."

"Not until I get this baby fat off, Bill. I look ugly."

"You look fantastic."

"Bill."

"Perfectly edible."

"William."

"Gorgeous. Stunning. You are a goddess divine."

He tipped them over onto their sides and she rolled over to face him.

"Fine," she said, a mischievous light in her clear blue eyes. "But you'll have to make an effort not to yell."

"I think you might be in more danger of that outlet," said Bill, ready for this challenge.

Her hand went right there. "Care to bet?" she asked.

They managed not to wake Lukas, even though things definitely got above a whisper. Afterward, with half of Fleur's sketches on the floor, Bill lay on his side, Fleur spooned against him. He felt incredible, like he had never been to Azkaban in the first place.

"I love you," he told Fleur.

"And I love you."

A knock on the door caused him to groan, but he got up and pulled on his trousers. When he opened the door, Ron was standing there with a letter in his hands. His younger brother looked at him and screwed up his face in disgust.

"Ugh. Could you at least make an effort to look like you haven't just shagged?"

Bill rolled his eyes. "What's up, Ronny?"

Ron scowled at the name and handed over the letter. "This just came in from the Floo."

Ron gave him one last, grossed out look and then walked back downstairs. Bill looked at the address on the letter and frowned.

"What is it?" asked Fleur, joining him by the door, only clad in his t-shirt. She had never looked sexier.

"It's from France," said Bill. He shut the door and leaned against it as he opened the letter and scanned the message. "Sweet Merlin," he whispered.

"What?"

"It's Michael."

"Who?"

"Julien Michael Barrett," said Bill. He handed the letter to her and then grabbed his wand from the bedside table. "He was in a coma. They said he probably wasn't going to survive, but he just woke up. They think he'll make a complete recovery."

He performed a few cleaning spells on himself and began to change into clean clothes.

"Are you going to see him?" asked Fleur.

"He doesn't know that his father is dead," said Bill. "I think he might want to hear it from someone who was there."

Fleur watched him get ready then, as he was brushing his hair, asked, "Aren't you forgetting someone?"

Bill turned, frowning.

"Draco," Fleur prompted. "Lucius' appeal is in a few hours, and he'll be Kissed tomorrow morning."

Bill sighed and ran a hand through his hair, completely negating his recent brushing. "I forgot about the appeal, not the execution."

"He's going to need you."

"No, I know. It's just…,"

"This is what happens when too many people like you. Next time you shouldn't be so nice."

Bill gave a tired laugh and looked back to the mirror.

"I'm sorry," he said.

"For what?" Fleur asked.

"For always being pulled around by other people. You do know I love you most, right?"

Fleur joined him at the bureau. "Of course," she said. She leaned up for a kiss. "And if you weren't always running to someone's rescue, you wouldn't be you. And I like you just fine the way you are."

"You're amazing," said Bill.

"I know," Fleur smiled. "Now go get on your white horse."

"Yes, milady," said Bill.

He was at Draco's door five minutes later. He knocked lightly and then opened the door.

Draco was half-reclined on his bed, propped up by pillows. His eyes were closed and Ginny lay curled up in his arms. She turned when Bill opened the door.

'He asleep?' Bill mouthed at her, but then Draco blinked his eyes open and turned as well.

"Bill," he said, pulling his arms back from around Ginny, causing her to sit up as well.

"Hey, sorry to wake you," said Bill. "Listen, Draco, I have to leave for a few. Julien Barrett woke up."

"The Curator's son," said Draco.

"Yeah, and I think I should be there, just for a little while."

Bill could be wrong, but he swore he saw a moment of panic in Draco's eyes. Just a flash of turmoiled silver, and then nothing.

"I'll be back this evening," he promised. "No later than seven, even if I have to swim the Channel to get here."

Draco shrugged. "Yeah, sure," he said. "You should be there."

"And I'll be back this evening," Bill said again, because he saw Draco's hand, saw the way his fingers were fumbling their pattern.

"Yeah, you said."

"And don't listen to the appeal. You don't need to, so forget about it, okay?"

Draco shrugged again.

"Draco, I'm serious. Don't listen to the radio."

"Fine," said Draco, but his voice was soft. The grey eyes glanced down.

"Okay," said Bill. "I'm sorry. Go back to sleep."

"I wasn't sleeping."

"Resting then."

Draco shrugged for a third time. "I'm up now. I think I might get some work done."

Bill nodded as well, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.

"Well, I'll see you at seven," he said.

He left, hearing Ginny try to cajole Draco into lying back down, but the genius wasn't listening. Bill sighed, but headed down the stairs. He grabbed his coat from the closet and then Flooed out to the International Portkey Station.

The station was busy. It was to be expected as the last of the families traveled home after the holidays. The lines were long and it looked as if most of the Keys were booked. Still, Bill stood in line at the ticket booth in hopes that he would find a spot open relatively soon. He glanced at the clock. He promised Draco he would be back by seven, and he meant to keep his word. Still, if the line didn't move any faster, he wouldn't even make it to France.

Forty-five minutes later, Bill stepped up to the counter.

"Hi," he said, giving the attendant a smile. Any hopes he had that a friendly demeanor would sneak him onto the next available lift died at the woman's sour expression. "I need the next Portkey to Paris."

She glanced down at the book in front of her. "Four o'clock," she said.

"Four?" Bill repeated. An hour and a half away. That would give him three hours to get to the hospital, visit Julien, tell him his father was dead, and make it back to the Order.

"Four," she said again. "And that's forty galleons."

Bill winced, but handed over his Gringott's charm. "I don't suppose you could make that a round trip?" he asked.

"Five, six or eight."

"What?"

"You can come back at five, six or eight today."

"Six, please," said Bill.

"That's sixty-five galleons total."

Bill sighed. "Thanks," he said.

He spent the hour and a half wait in the lounge area, not that a lounge really described the thinly padded chairs. The radio was playing, set on a classical station. Bill was glad. Lucius' appeal was at three, and while it was a closed hearing, the news channels would report from outside the closed doors until the verdict came in. Bill had no desire to listen to the news. He was avoiding it like Draco was…hopefully.

Twenty minutes into the wait and he broke from the boredom and bought a paper-back novel from the tiny bookstore in the station. It was part of a series that Bill had seen around. Honestly, it wasn't any good.

He boarded the lift-like box exactly at four and held onto the handles hanging from the ceiling. It was crowded, all space taken. The witches in the corner were whispering about something in the paper they were reading, but Bill didn't pay them any mind. He waited impatiently for the doors to slide shut, and once everyone was boarded, the doors slide shut. Instead of feeling the rise and drop of a normal lift, there was a jerking sideways pull. An older gentleman bumped into Bill and apologized profusely.

"I just can't believe it," one of the witches was saying. "I mean, were there even guards?"

The doors whooshed open and Bill fought his way out of the lift and into the Portkey Station of Paris. This terminal was just as busy, but for some reason, it was quieter. Wizards and witches were huddled in groups, exchanging newspapers and shaking their heads. Bill could see the stores in the station were swamped with costumers grabbing at the newspaper and exclaiming over the headline. He felt a cold dread rise in his stomach.

"Excuse me," he said, stopping the two English witches and they exited the lift. "May I see your newspaper?"

"You can have it," said the witch. "I've read it already."

Bill walked to the wall where he would be out of the way and slowly raised the paper. It was an emergency update paper, consisting of two pages, nothing more. He stared, swore, and stared again. The headline said everything, but he had to read the rest.

LUCIUS MALFOY COMMITS SUICIDE IN PRISON

Lucius Malfoy was found dead in his cell by Azkaban guards and Aurors this afternoon before his last appeal. The cause of death was a knife to the chest. Aurors are confident that this was suicide. An investigation is underway to determine how Malfoy came into the possession of the weapon.

Lucius Malfoy was imprisoned for the death of Minister Cornelius Fudge…

And the article went on to describe the charges and trial of Lucius. Bill let the paper drop when he had finished reading it and walked over to the ticket counter. The attendants there were whispering, looking at the picture on the front, depicting the prison of Azkaban.

"Hi," said Bill. "I need the first Portkey you have for England."

The Portkey they had was at four-thirty, but he came in at Dover, not London. Because it was a smaller station, he had to take the Knight bus into London. Luckily he was able to convince the driver it was an emergency and he was dropped off first on Grimmauld Street, despite the other passengers' protests.

Bill ran into Number 12 as soon as it materialized. His mother met him at the door.

"Bill, you're here, thank Merlin."

"Where is he?" asked Bill.

"He's in his study. We heard the news not two hours ago, and we went in to tell him, and…," she stopped him in the dining room, where half of the family was gathered, newspapers on the table, radio on. "Bill, he's not talking."

"You're not pressuring him, are you?" asked Bill.

"We're not trying to, but he's pushing everyone away. He nearly had a fit when we first told him. Told us all to leave him alone and nearly threw an ink bottle at Sirius."

Bill glanced over to Sirius, but the man shrugged, apparently not at all offended.

"It's hard news to take," he said. "And we all know he must have been the one to bring Lucius the knife."

"We don't know that," said Molly. "And why would he anyway? It makes no sense."

"Because death is very much preferable than the Dementor's Kiss, especially in Pureblood families," said Sirius. "Hell, suicide was seen as an honorable way to deal with scandal."

"I don't give a shit if it is honorable," said Bill. "Is there someone with him now? Please tell me you didn't leave him alone."

"Ginny's with him," said Molly, sounding as if that situation wasn't to her liking at all. "She's the only he has threatened with bodily harm if he wasn't left alone."

"I'll go," said Bill, heading for the back room.

"Bill," said his mother, stopping his once more. "He's not even crying. If he really brought in the knife, then-,"

"He doesn't cry," said Bill, cutting her off before anyone could form notions about his reaction.

"Everyone cries," said Mrs. Weasley.

"No," said Bill, shaking his head. "His bitch of a mother put an anti-crying hex on him the day he was born, and left it on until he was seven. He doesn't cry because he can't."

And then he was turning again, nearly running down the hall to Draco's study. The door was halfway open, and Ginny was there, speaking softly. Draco was standing over the table, arms braced on the surface, hands gripping the edge like he had gripped the bench on the boat. He was tensed to the point of shaking.

Ginny had a hand on his shoulder, she was rubbing softly, and while he didn't react, didn't even look at her, he wasn't pushing her away.

Bill stepped into the room. Ginny looked over and whispered something in Draco's ear. There was no response. Ginny gave Bill a wan smile and then slipped out of the room. Bill watched Draco, then took a step forward.

"Draco," he said.

He watched as Draco shoved off from the table, spinning away, facing the wall.

Bill took another step forward.

"Draco," he said again.

"Don't," Draco ordered.

His voice made Bill winced. It was raw and strained, a raspy sound that came from repressed tears. Draco's tears weren't just repressed though, more like magically suppressed.

"I'm so sorry," said Bill.

"I said don't!"

The words were tinged with hysteria. Bill saw the hand that Draco raised to clench in his hair. He saw the way the white-blond strands were tugged and pulled.

"Draco," he said.

Draco turned, his grey eyes burning silver. He was shaking in fury, his jaw set and face white.

"Mon Dieu, won't you stop?" he ground out.

"If I had known, I wouldn't have left," said Bill.

He saw the self-control in Draco snap. Draco started in his direction, his eyes on the door. He was running. Bill did the only thing he could. He stepped in Draco's way.

Draco very nearly collided with his chest. He managed to stop, though, and then Bill wrapped his arms around him. Draco fought at first. He swore, and pushed at Bill's shoulders. He threatened and tried to step away. Bill held on.

He could feel the change, feel when Draco stopped struggling. Instead of pushing, Draco's hands found his coat and grasped the cloth. He was no longer leaning back, trying to escape, he was leaning into Bill, trying to stay standing. Bill held on tighter as Draco sagged in his arms.

The swearing had trailed off into gasps, gasps and hard swallows. Bill, with his arms around Draco, holding him up against his chest, could feel each and every choking breath.

It was ugly, the sounds Draco was making. It was hard and rasping and grating. There were no tears to ease the cries, no wet, flowing sobs. Every inhalation was a desperate battle, every exhale a pain-ridden release. Draco wasn't crying; it sounded like he was dying.

Bill held on a little tighter, his own eyes stinging and tears finally slipping down his cheeks.

"I'm so sorry," he said, even though he didn't know what he was apologizing for specifically. It might have been for Lucius' death, or for the fact that his own parents were alive.

He might have been apologizing for the fact that he, and not Draco, was crying.

oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo—oOoOoOo

I realize most of you didn't want Lucius to die. The next chapter will be up in two weeks, and until then, I'll be hiding from the angry reviewers. But please do review, even if you are angry. It'll be cathartic that way. And I'm not sorry. I've been planning Lucius' death since the first book….I think it fits.





27. The Last Will and Testament of L Malfoy

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter, and that is a sad thing to write.

Author's note: I'm late, but by like five hours. And I stayed up, until five o'clock, to finish it. Because I love you all. So remember, it's five. My grammar might suck. Please find it in yourselves to enjoy it anyway!

OOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOO

Draco opened his eyes and half-turned, glancing at the clock over the fireplace. Nine o' five. The clock was a modern style, smooth lines and contours. The entire apartment was sleek, but with touches of warmth to keep it comfortable. Pansy had done most of the decorating; Blaise just footed the bill.

"You okay?" came a soft voice.

"Yeah," said Draco, and he settled back down, head on the pillow in Pansy's lap and her fingers began stroking through his hair again. "I'm fine."

Blaise looked over from the armchair he was sitting in, but didn't say anything. Draco let out a breath and stared at the ceiling.

There were other people he could be with, should be with.

He had left without warning. After collapsing onto Bill's shoulder for an hour, he had abruptly let go and said he wanted to be alone. It wasn't that Bill wasn't comforting; Draco was just uncomfortable with being comforted. He hadn't meant to break down like that, and if Lucius had simply died, he wouldn't have.

Well, he probably would have after a few days, but this was different. He had killed Lucius. He had killed him and then walked away and the knowledge, hour by hour, had been eating at him, had been tearing at him since before he had even given his father the knife. Draco had made his decision the night before the visit, after his encounter with Bellatrix. He had kept silent for too long, and then when the news broke, Bill hadn't been there to ward away his family. Ginny had done her best, but there had been pity, and questions, and prying, and touches on his shoulders, choking hugs and smothering attention. He couldn't escape, and they were all telling him it was okay to cry.

So he nearly lost it when Bill finally came. He regained composure an hour later, asked Bill to leave, and Apparated. He had left a note, of course, promising to avoid temptation and to keep in contact. He escaped to Blaise and Pansy's. Blaise broke out the whiskey. They didn't mix the drinks, but drank straight from the bottles, and when Draco woke up the next morning, he was lying face down on the couch, Blaise sprawled on the floor, and Pansy was draped over an armchair. She was in a state of unsurprising undress.

It had taken Draco three different hangover cures to get himself up, and then he wandered, not quite aimlessly, and ended up on a Muggle ferry to France. From there, it was two trains and a magic cab ride to the cemetery where Lukas was buried.

The cemetery was a small, and climate-controlled with spells to be a warm spring day all year round. The flowers never died there.

Lukas was buried by his mother's family, and under their name. It was a large monument, but nothing too gaudy. Draco had perched on the cornerstone and smoked a few cigarettes he had stolen from Pansy and mentally named all of the toxins he was inhaling and how, exactly, they were destroying his body. He wondered if it was self-destruction if he kept the damage minimal.

That was when suicide fluttered through his mind, but it was just that, a thought. Not a desire, not a temptation, not an option. He simply thought sometimes.

Draco had apologized to Lukas for killing their father. He then broke down again, gasping and choking against the grave. It seemed all he could remember were the good times, when Lucius taught him how to ride a broom and how to play Quidditch. The afternoons when Lucius would come home early and take dinners with Draco. The summer days when Lucius would vacation with Draco. The times when Lucius took Draco along on his business trips. Draco remembered them all perfectly. The sun, or the clouds, at home or away, the touch of Lucius' hand, a directing pressure on his back, or those treasured times when his hair was ruffled in approval. The one time Lucius kissed his forehead.

And then he had remembered how rare those moments with Lucius had been. He remembered the times when Lucius left or disregarded . The times he had been passed over for work. The times when he had been deemed not important. The times when Lucius should have paid him attention, on holidays, on his birthdays, the times when he had been sick and alone. The presents that were supposed to make up for the solitude. Those memories had him pressing his palms against stinging, dry eyes, mourning for another reason.

He had returned to Blaise and Pansy when night fell and proved to be too much for him to handle. That night shots of vodka were poured, and holding true with Pureblood traditions, salutes were given to the departed. Of course, in Pureblood tradition, it wasn't customary to use vodka, and it sure as hell wasn't customary to get thoroughly plastered, but when Pansy hiccupped through her recounting of Lucius' interruption when he and Pansy were about to have sex on the parlor sofa, resulting in the three of them laughing so hard they tumbled to the floor, Draco thought Lucius would have probably been amused.

Draco had owled Bill again that morning, and sent a letter to Ginny as well. It didn't say much, but he thought it was better than nothing. This time, when he wandered the streets, he didn't have a destination in mind. The Muggle world was loud and fast and dirty, and even though he had lived in it before, he never enjoyed his experiences. It was numbing though, and the chaos was ordered. There, he didn't have to worry about being spotted, and he didn't have to worry about succumbing to his addiction.

He was back with Blaise and Pansy when the evening fell. This time they didn't bring out alcohol. Draco now found himself, an hour later, lying on their sofa, his head in Pansy's lap and she was smoothing his hair with her fingers. There were hands he would rather have combing through his hair. Hands with a gentler touch that came with a soothing voice.

He glanced over at the clock again. It was now nine-fifteen.

He sat up.

"Heading back?" asked Pansy.

Draco glanced at the clock again. "Yeah."

"Anytime you need to stop by," said Blaise.

"Thanks," said Draco.

He used the Floo, and when he stepped into the hallway of Grimmauld Place, he was content to be back. He was glad he had left, of course, but it simply felt right returning. There were voices from other rooms, from the living room, and laughter drifting down from the stairs. Draco took a moment to breathe in and steady himself for any questions that might come his way. There were footsteps on the stairs, light, fast footsteps, and Draco turned, ready with a calm mask.

It was Ginny, and she stopped halfway down the steps to look over the banister. She saw him and hurried down the rest of the stairs. She stopped in front of him.

"Hi," she said softly.

Draco's lip quirked. "Hi," he said back.

She considered him for a moment.

"You look better," she said.

Draco appreciated the non-question, but answered her anyway.

"I'm getting there," he said.

She smiled and her eyes were warm. Draco was taken aback at how genuinely happy she seemed to be at his presence. Merlin, he hadn't done anything to warrant that look. In an attempt to make up for it, he reached a hand out, grasping her own and tugging her forward. She responded, tip-toeing to wrap her arms around his neck. He ducked his head and found her lips. He kissed her thoroughly, making her moan into his mouth. Perhaps he was indulging himself as well, but he couldn't really help himself. Her lips were soft, she tasted sweet, and her hands drifted over her neck and delved into his hair. She moved against him perfectly, and here, with her, he could forget, if only for a moment.

"Ginny, is that Draco?"

Bill's voice came from the living room. Ginny pulled away long enough to call back, "Nope, must have been a mis-Floo."

There was no mistaking the smile in her voice, and then she was locking lips with him again. Maybe she understood how he needed her at this moment.

"Draco, don't make me come over there," Bill called.

Draco reluctantly pulled back, brushing her cheek once because her skin was that incredibly smooth. He walked over to the living room and paused in the doorway.

Bill was sitting on the couch, a notebook in his lap. Hermione was knitting with Mrs. Weasley, Mr. Weasley was reading a paper, and Charlie had a book and Lukas tucked into the crook of his arm. They were all looking at the door when he appeared and Draco forced himself to only look at Bill.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey," said Bill. He glanced over at the other occupants of the room, and then at Charlie and Lukas. Satisfied his son was being looked after, he got up and headed for the hall. Draco let him pass and followed him back to his study. Bill took the chair. Draco leaned against his desk, not wanting to sit because he didn't really want to have this conversation. Ginny followed them in, something which surprised him, but he wasn't averse to her presence. She took a seat in the corner on the piano bench.

"How are you?" Bill asked. "Please don't say fine."

Draco had been going to say fine. Instead he thought for a moment, because Bill deserved more, then said, "As well as can be expected."

Bill nodded, but his expression was still tight.

"I just…I needed to get away," said Draco. "Being here, I couldn't. Not with everyone." It wasn't the most eloquent expression of emotion; it wasn't even grammatically sound. It conveyed what was needed though, and Bill was a translator. Draco found that this vague confession was easier.

"I understand," said Bill. "Not at first, but now I understand. Are you going to get through this?"

Draco gave a shrug. "In my head, I know that it was the best, and I know that Lu-," he cut off because couldn't quite get the name out without choking. He tried again. "I know that he would rather it be this way, but-," he shrugged again.

"I don't think your logic is going to be a source of comfort," said Bill. "Maybe in a week or so, until then, it's okay to hurt."

Draco nodded, not in total agreement, but to show he heard.

"For what it's worth," said Bill, "I don't think you made the wrong decision."

Draco understood the nuances in the phrasing. Bill wouldn't say he had done the right thing, because he would never have done such a thing, nor did he fully understand. He would never have to make the choice Draco made.

Bill got up and stepped close to Draco, pulling him into a side hug. Draco didn't return the embrace, but he didn't pull away.

"I'm glad you're back," Bill finished. He smiled and left. Draco let out a breath.

"Harry and Ron and Hermione are dueling with Dumbledore," said Ginny from the corner.

Draco turned and raised an eyebrow.

"Snape came back, well, not really. He just stopped by really quickly. No one expected him, but he said that Voldemort was nearly finished rooting out the troops. And the Dementors, the ones that left Azkaban, are with him. It sounds as if more attacks will be coming, so Dumbledore decided it was time to teach Harry how to duel."

"About time," said Draco, sitting more fully on the table now.

"I don't think starting the lessons is a source of consternation, kind of like admitting the war is here for real. Not to mention everyone at the Order wants to be Harry's mum or dad. They don't want to admit that they can't protect him from this."

"They're going to have to get over that rather quickly," said Draco.

"It's weird though," said Ginny. "I mean, why Harry?"

"Because he's an orphan thrust into a new world and still maintains the generally accepted moral code," said Draco. "Very heroic."

Ginny snorted. It was a cute sound. "Not that," she clarified. "Why does he have to be the one to kill Voldemort? Aren't prophecies usually more generic?"

The prophecy was direct, and not knowing the specific phrasing, Draco couldn't ascertain the reason it had to be Potter.

"I don't know," he said, and then frowned because he didn't like saying those words.

"Anyway," said Ginny. "That's where they are. And Fred and George are entertaining Fleur, so if you and I wanted to, say, claiming the drawing room for ourselves, we could without interruption." She got a coy look on her face, and pushed herself off the bench to stand in front of him. Her hair was down and slid over the side of her face. She looked at him from underneath lowered lashes. It was an appealing picture. "It's a little more…comfortable than your office."

Draco felt the corner of his lip quirk. "And what did you need the additional comfort for?" he asked.

"Well, Dumbledore also said that school was starting again in a week and a half or so, and I need you to look over my Transfigurations essay." She gave him an apologetic smile. "But I promise a massage while you work."

Merlin, she was exactly what he needed. His lips settled into a soft smirk. "I think I can oblige."

And so he spent the evening looking over a sixth year Transfigurations paper that he could have written when he was five, but she had a pleasing script and a clear voice in her paper. And over all it was very well written. He may have taken more time than necessary looking it over because her hands worked out three hard days of tension like magic.

She didn't mention his father at all, for which he was grateful. In fact, even when the rest of the Order returned, the subject was avoided.

Kingsley did approach him at breakfast, with an apologetic look on his face.

"I need to know if you supplied the knife to your father," said Kingsley. "There is an investigation, and you may be charged with aiding and abetting."

"Aiding and abetting?" Bill demanded.

"I'm not asking in an official capacity," Kingsley was quick to reassure. "I just need to know if I should waste my time looking for another culprit or not. I thought for sure it was your knife you had snuck through, but it's still in your study."

Draco nodded. He figured that he would be an investigation and that he was the main suspect.

"I gave Lucius the knife. Not that knife, but I made one. I didn't know if it would work, but it appears I managed fine."

"You replicated it?" Bill asked. "When?"

"A week or so ago. I thought it might come in handy."

He took a sip of his coffee.

"I don't think the charges will stick," said Kingsley. "Not if they don't give you Veritaserum."

"They couldn't give it to me for anything less than murder," said Draco. "Even assisting suicide doesn't count."

Kingsley nodded, hesitated, and then said, "You do realize Lucius could have used that knife to escape. He could have killed someone with that knife."

Draco shook his head. "No. He couldn't have." He thought and then amended his statement. "He could have killed a guard, yes, but he wouldn't have been able to escape. Contrary to popular belief, he isn't – wasn't like Voldemort in regard to the joy for senseless murder. The knife was for one purpose, if he chose. It was the very least I could do. I don't expect any of you to understand."

There was a pause.

"I do," said Sirius.

Draco nodded and then turned back to his breakfast, signaling the conversation was over.

Draco knew Lucius didn't have to use the knife, but he wondered if he had somehow forced his father's hand. What if there had been a chance that the appeal would have gone through…what if the Da- Voldemort had decided Lucius was useful after all…what if there was an escape plan but Lucius had decided not to chance it, not with the certainty of death by his own hand…what if – but no, there was no way to be sure. He was going to drive himself insane if he kept going through every remote possibility. Still, looking back, he wondered if he should have told Lucius more. He wished he had thanked him, or told his father that he was pretty sure he loved him.

He wished Lucius had said more to him. He had said 'I never needed another child', but there were so many ways that could be interpreted. Did Lucius truly care for him, or was that simply a recognition that by providing the knife, he had performed one more act of service for the family.

Draco clenched his jaw and put the fork down. His fingers twisted together.

Conversation around him stilled, but then was renewed with deliberate questions and feigned casualness. He knew they were trying to be kind, to give him a moment to collect himself, but he couldn't help but feel their quick glances his way. He couldn't help but feel their pity. Pity for him because he couldn't handle the loss of a parent who was never there to begin with. Since when did he become so dependant? It was pathetic.

Yes, pathetic, said Lord Draco. Pining after Daddy's affection now that you killed him off. Did you really think he cared for you in any way? Especially after what you did?

I didn't force him to use it. It was his choice.

Trying to convince yourself? asked Lord Draco with a cruel edge.

Draco tried to push the voice away, tried to school his face into something a little softer than his current grimace. It had once been so easy to pull up a cool mask.

Just another thing he had lost.

The Floo flared and a letter flew from the flames to hover in front of his face. It took a moment for Draco to notice, and then he stared at the seal. It was from the Heritage office. But he didn't think Lucius would have left him anything.

Draco hardly noticed the hush around the table. He reached out and took the letter. It dropped lightly into his hands and he pressed the tip of his finger on the wax seal. It pricked his flesh and absorbed the drop of scarlet. The ward broke at the touch of his blood and the seal disappeared. The letter unfolded and Draco felt a moment of fear. Perhaps he was left something. A spell perhaps, a curse on his future children.

He read it, and then had to go over the words again because he couldn't believe what he was reading.

To Mr. Draco Malfoy,

At the passing of Lucius Malfoy, his last testament named you as complete beneficiary to his estate and worldly goods. He has decreed that you will succeed him in name and title.

Our condolences for your loss. All questions can be addressed to the Heritage Office.

Your signum will be reactivated at the opening of this letter. For any health concerns, do not hesitate to make an appointment at our office or your own Healer.

Regards,

Edward Thurston

Draco could only stare, his eyes flickering over the words again and again. He only stopped when he felt a warm glow spread from the fingers grasping the parchment up his arm. He sucked in a breath.

"Draco? Draco, what is it?" asked Bill, apprehension in his voice.

"No," said Draco, shaking his head at the concern. "No, it's…," he meant to say fine, but then the glow surged into a tingling, warm spear, shooting through his arm and shoulder, wrapping around to his back.

It didn't hurt, but it was strong. He dropped the parchment and grasped onto the table.

The sensation across his back was a strange one, but never more welcome. It was as if his skin had been frozen across the tattoo, pulling at his muscles, not allowing him to stretch. Now, that ice was melting away. He could feel the snake unwinding, writhing in freedom, the trees finally bowing to that invisible wind. His skin itched and tingled, pins and needles, like it had finally woken up.

He reached back, needing to feel it. He pulled his shirt up and over his head, leaving it on his arms, and he tried to twist back, but he couldn't see it without a mirror. He looked to Bill.

"Is it back?" he asked, twisting so Bill could see.

"Sweet Merlin," said Bill, and then Draco felt the cool brush of his fingers. "It's moving," said Bill. "And it's red."

Draco laughed, a confused, euphoric, overwhelmed laugh.

"You still have the scars," said Bill, quieter, but Draco couldn't bring himself to care.

"It's back," he said. He pulled his shirt back on because the table was staring and he had never enjoyed being so exposed in the presence of others. "He…he reinstated me, even after…," he trailed off and then grabbed at the parchment, flipping to the second page. This was the actual copy of the will, of all the changes that had been made in the past.

"He never named another beneficiary," said Draco in disbelief. Draco had been disinherited and disowned, but because there had never been another name to inherit the Malfoy fortune, half would have gone to Draco by default, the other to Narcissa. "And it was two weeks ago. Two weeks ago he reinstated me, naming me heir."

His hand rose to his head and tangled in his hair because his fingers couldn't tap out his pattern.

"He…he never," Draco realized he was babbling, but couldn't seem to stop. "He did. He cared." He sucked in a breath, and looked up. "I apologize," he said, and stood, ready to excuse himself, but Ginny grabbed his hand and Bill put a hand on his shoulder. Together they forced him, gently, back into his chair.

"Draco," said Bill, "I think it's safe, after seeing this, to say that Lucius loved you."

Draco looked into Bill's eyes, and saw that Bill honestly believed it. The thought turned over in his mind, and instead of listing every reason that couldn't be, instead of remembering every time he was left behind, or discarded, or ignored, he thought that maybe, just maybe, Bill could be right.

He could have laughed right then, laughed for the indescribable sensation that rose from his chest at that moment, but there was an odd sting to the warmth that seemed to leave him breathless. He fought for control, swallowing hard and turning to Ginny.

She smiled beautifully, but she was blinking through her smile. He could see dew drops in the corner of her eyes and knew she was crying for him. He brushed her cheek.

Beside him, Bill raised his coffee mug. "To Lucius Malfoy," he said.

And the Order toasted to the recently passed, former right-hand man of Voldemort.

OOOoooOOOoooOOOooooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOO

"Last order of business today," said John. He held up a file. "Lucius Malfoy's last will and testament."

Percy picked his head up from where it had been pillowed in his arms on the table. He had spent the entire Civis Arma meeting with his eyes closed. He hadn't fallen asleep, and his constant contributions to the meeting had proved that to the other members, but Tierney was running him ragged. Something was always wrong, or needed revision. Even when the schedule was perfectly ordered, Tierney found something to change, usually the entire agenda for the day. And Percy was in charge of catering to his contradictory whims, and when he couldn't switch the afternoon conferences with the morning meetings, it was his fault, never Tierney's.

Percy knew what Tierney was trying to do. As Assistant, he couldn't be fired by the Minister alone, unless it was proven that he had been grossly negligent in his duties. As Assistant, the only way he would be dismissed was with the cabinet's approval. That, or he could quit. Tierney was trying to make him quit.

Of course, the fact that he wasn't quitting was putting him under some steep suspicion from Tierney. No sane man would stay in such an abused position, not even for power. So Percy had to pretend that he was an idiot. A very smart, capable idiot. He had to pretend that he was a spineless devotee to power. He had to pretend that he was Wormtail to Tierney's Voldemort.

When Tierney lost the schedule for the week, Percy's original, first copy schedule, for the fourth time, Percy had to re-write it all, pretending that he didn't see the cruel stare or the vindictive smile. He had to rewrite it, while blathering on about how hard it was to keep track of papers and that no, he didn't mind at all. These things happen. He learned to make two copies after that.

When Tierney informed him, two hours before the Minister's banquet, that he wanted Eanes and Chadwick to be sitting at his table, disrupting the entire seating chart (because Eanes and Chadwick were two, steady, buffering individuals that were already placed in between key parties), Percy had to adamantly agree with Tierney's assessment and rearrange the entire floor plan. It took him an hour and a half and earned him evil glares from the kitchen staff. Then he had to dress for the banquet and arrived late. Tierney didn't let him forget it.

When Tierney had him stay up all night, writing a two-hour speech to address the tax legislation changes he was proposing and how it would affect national and international trade, only to throw out the entire thing out the next morning, Percy had to clench his fist and smile and say yes, the Minister had far more important things to do that day. After lunch, Tierney changed his mind again, and asked Percy if he wouldn't mind rewriting it because he had used the first copy to start a fire for a Floo call. Percy pulled out a spare copy he had made, anticipating the cruelty.

When Tierney canceled visits to France or Germany or any other country, Percy had to make that call. He had to cancel without an official reason, but in such a way so that Tierney could still visit, on a whim, in three days. When Tierney refused to meet with a visiting Ambassador, because he didn't 'feel like it' that day, Percy had to personally meet in Tierney's place to keep good international relations. That meant he was giving up two hours of work time, hours he had to tag onto the end of an eleven hour day.

It was like following a toddler every day, and trying to undue every mess he made. And Percy couldn't even smack Tierney. He was never having children.

He was exhausted. He didn't know how much longer he could last, but he couldn't leave. Not when the Civis Arma needed his information. Working directly with the Minister was a source they couldn't afford to lose. So Percy had spent the hour meeting trying to rest. Now, though, now he was sitting at attention with the rest of the group. Lucius Malfoy's death had rocked the news yesterday, and now that it was official, his will was the source of great speculation.

"Do you think he really left everything to Voldemort?" asked Rudy Costace, Auror, drumming his fingers on the table.

"If it does, we'll just have to take it to court. There's no way we'd allow that sort of finance to go to him," said John Kelly, Head of the Cabinet and leader of their secret group.

"Malfoy wouldn't have named Voldemort as the heir, not directly," said Percy. "He would have named a fellow Death Eater, and we couldn't contest that."

"But Voldemort put him in prison," said Jonathan Felix, also a member of the cabinet.

"He doesn't know that," said June Peterson, a member of the Wizengamot and sitting on the Council of Governors. "He thinks it was Bellatrix."

"Can't we just fake a will?" asked Helen. Helen, blonde hair, cropped short in a bob to make herself look less attractive, wanting to be taken seriously. She shouldn't have chosen to be an Auror. The red robes looked far too good on her. It took a moment for Percy to realize she was looking at him.

He shook his head, and looked away. "The will is going straight to several authenticators first thing tomorrow morning." To be more specific, in just a few hours. "When this amount of money is in question, no chances are taken. There's no way we could have something faked by then. Two weeks, maybe."

"So we let this one through, but we start on a fake copy, and then date it later," said John.

Percy shook his head again. "It'd be too late. Voldemort would have everything conveniently spent, and the properties would be stripped of all valuables." Percy hated being the bearer of bad news, but when one was the Assistant, one became familiar with all aspects of the law. Telling the hard truth now would save them all time and money. Still, it felt like he was always turning down ideas.

"Do we even want to open it then?" asked Rudy. "If it's only going to be bad news…,"

"Let's open it," said Percy. "At least give us time to brace ourselves."

John passed the file open to him. "As Assistant, you'd actually be cleared to see the contents of the will."

"So would you," said Percy.

"I'd need a warrant and an Auror beside me," said John. "You can just feel the need to disclose the information with us after you read it."

Sometimes, this group amused him. Here they were, a secret group made up of some of the most powerful men and women in the Ministry, chosen by the mythological Round Table to uphold justice in this time of turmoil, and little things like looking at a will troubled them. That was why they were chosen though. They were chosen because they would never abuse their power.

Percy flipped open the folder. One page was on top, only a paragraph written with three signatures on the bottom. The incredible stack behind it was a list of the assets of the Malfoy fortune. Percy read the statement, his eyebrows rising in surprise and a tired, weary smile crossing his face.

'I, Lucius Malfoy, pledge all of my worldly goods to my son and heir Draco Lucius Malfoy upon my demise. He is the sole beneficiary and executor of my estate.'

Lucius S. Malfoy

"What is it?" asked Rudy.

"He left it all to his son," said Percy. "He left it all to Draco Malfoy."

"But he disowned him," said Helen.

"And he's reinstated him," said Percy.

"Draco Malfoy," said John. "He's on our side, right?"

"He's in the Order," said Percy.

"And dating your sister," said Rudy, obviously finding that amusing.

Percy shot the young Auror a look.

"But why?" asked Peterson.

"Because Lucius Malfoy was anything but a fool," said Percy. "I bet he knew it was Voldemort setting him up all along."

"What makes you say that?" asked John.

"Because the will is dated a week before he had Fudge assassinated," said Percy. "He suspected, and he never named Voldemort in his will."

It was the best news they had all week. The meeting adjourned at two in the morning on that high note. Percy slept well that night.

He wondered if Tierney could see the difference that morning. He had come in, feeling more energetic than he had in a year, and while meeting with Tierney over breakfast, he managed to give the man an insincere smile. He realized the smile may not have been the best course of action when Tierney stopped him before he left.

"Weasley, stop," he said, as if he was ordering a dog.

Percy turned, affixing a neutral look on his face. "Yes, sir."

"You aren't terribly busy today, are you?" asked Tierney.

"We are preparing for your trip to Canada, sir," said Percy. Tierney knew that the day before a trip was hell, but that wouldn't stop him from sending him on a fool's errand. Percy wasn't going to give him the satisfaction of listing off every responsibility he had to do today so Tierney could ruin his plans.

"I need you to go to Azkaban," said Tierney.

Percy blinked in surprise. "Azkaban, sir?"

"Lucius Malfoy committed suicide two days ago."

"I am aware, sir. The Aurors are handling the investigation. I can have them send you a progress report, if you wished, sir. As it is, I wouldn't be able to personally leave for the prison until after three, not unless you wanted me to cancel the board meeting."

Percy took great pleasure in making Tierney order him to cancel meetings. It was the one thing he had done right from the start. Whenever Tierney's whims had him snub a national group, Percy always name dropped, making sure they knew it was Tierney who had canceled. He liked to spread ill will from the Minister, just so people knew how stupid they had been to elect him.

"After three will be fine," said Tierney, not rising to the bait this time. "I'm afraid the trip might be a long one, I trust you are significantly recovered from your last run-in with the Dementors?"

Of course Tierney would find a way to put him in contact with the Dementors. The last time Percy had seen one, he spent two days in a hospital after the attack at the debates.

"Completely recovered, sir," said Percy, not showing the dread he felt. He also didn't tell him that he had been labeled 'Sensitive' to the Dementors, because Tierney would only take that much more pleasure out of sending him there.

"Good," said Tierney. "Someone stole Lucius Malfoy's body."

It took a moment for Percy to process the words.

"Someone stole his body?" he asked in disbelief.

"Yes. Needless to say, the Ministry is interested in such a happenstance."

No, the Ministry would launch an inquiry with Aurors, but not see it as a great loss. Tierney, on the other hand, still had ties to Voldemort. Perhaps the Dark Lord had wanted the body as proof to his followers not to cross him.

Another thought crossed his mind. Perhaps Lucius wasn't even dead.

A chill washed over him, as if he was already at Azkaban. Lucius Malfoy had been a powerful man, one that Voldemort apparently couldn't control or manipulate. It made sense that, once Voldemort heard about the missing body, he would demand Tierney to investigate. Tierney had to comply, of course.

No, he was being ridiculous. If Lucius Malfoy was pronounced dead at Azkaban, then he had crossed the Veil completely. Azkaban had wards to prevent the faking of deaths. The 'Juliet effect' had never succeeded in the prison.

"I want to know what happened," said Tierney. "Right now, only the responding guards and Aurors know that his body was stolen. I want to keep it that way."

"Yes, sir," said Percy.

He arrived at Azkaban at three-thirty. From the moment he could spot the island, he could feel the Dementors. He knew their presence was lessened, as nearly half had attacked the Ministry and then left with Voldemort. Even so, the chill set in, and by the time he landed and was ushered into the back entrance, for confidentiality's sake, he was nearly trembling.

The Healers had told him he would find himself affected to a greater degree in the presence of Dementors. They had also told him that he shouldn't pursue a career at Azkaban. And here he was.

Percy gratefully pulled on the thicker, cheerier robes of the Azkaban guards, bright electric green. It was one of the perks of being Assistant. He got the good robes. He also got to hold onto his wand.

"Here's your pin," said the welcoming guard. "It's attuned to your mental state. Green is good. Yellow, not so much. Orange means you should think about heading out. Red means you need to get the hell out. Black means you might find yourself jumping off the nearest high point."

"Green good, red leave," said Percy. "Got it."

The guard fastened the badge onto his robe and then stepped back. It immediately turned a shade of sickly yellow-green.

"Sensitive?" asked the guard.

Percy nodded and knew, right then, Tierney had read his medical report.

The door opened, letting in a blast of Dementor-cool air, and Percy saw his pin lose a few more drops of blue. He was nearly a dandelion right now.

"Assistant, thank you for coming," said the man who came through. The insignia of the Warden was on his robes. "I'm Bryant Thatcher."

Percy shook his hand. "I assume you know why I'm here."

"Yes, I do."

"The Minister has taken a personal interest in this case."

"Of course he has. He put Malfoy away, didn't he?"

"I believe the informant was actually Bellatrix Lestrange," said Percy. He also liked to remind the public of the Minster's nefarious associates.

"Ah, yes," said Thatcher awkwardly.

"I need to know what you told the Aurors," said Percy.

"Absolutely," said Thatcher. "I'll give you the tour."

Thatcher led him to the maximum security wing, to the last cell. The fourth wall was open. There was blood on the floor of the cell, and in areas where the puddle was the deepest, it still looked tacky. There was too much of it. Lucius Malfoy did indeed die here.

"It was only a few minutes before he would have been brought to his appeal," said the Warden. "We have a few alarms to signal when there is a suicide attempt, but none of them went off."

Percy raised his eyebrows at that. "They didn't?"

"The alarms also didn't sound at the presence of the weapon," said Thatcher. "There must have been some new spells on the knife."

"Or old ones," said Percy. He stepped closer and looked about the room. "Where is the knife now?"

"It's gone as well."

"Of course it is," Percy muttered.

"The guards who found him are in questioning with the Aurors. Even they don't know that the body is gone."

"When did the body go missing?"

"Sometime yesterday," said Thatcher. "We had brought it down to the mortuary. Follow me."

They traveled to the bowels of Azkaban which was exponentially warmer and more comfortable than the higher floors. The basements housed the infirmary, the guards' break room, and the morgue. There were smears of blood on the metal table on the side of the room.

"Malfoy was brought here after he was pronounced dead. There was a single stab wound in his chest." Thatcher gestured to his own chest, right where his ribs separated under his sternum. Percy recognized the positioning.

"Immolare," he said, referring to the suicide ritual practiced centuries ago, back when a man's honor was worth more than the amount of gold in his purse.

"What?" asked the Warden.

"Never mind," said Percy. "How long was the body here before disappearing?"

"At least twelve hours. Maybe twenty-four. He was the only stiff, so after the initial pronouncement, he was left here until it could be decided where he was going. Most are buried here, but in some cases, the family wants them back."

Twelve hours. That window of time covered at least two shifts of Aurors. Percy pinched the bridge of his nose.

"The guards are still be questioned by the Aurors," said the Warden, "but I'm sure you can sit in, if you would like."

"I think I had better," said Percy. And he, reluctantly, followed the Warden up to the few visiting rooms. His hands were blocks of ice and his nails were turning blue. His pin was starting to turn orange.

The guards were still being debriefed, all of them, even those who didn't respond to the suicide. Only two guards even knew the body was missing, two guards, the mortician, and five Aurors. Percy was filled in by Abner Hastings, the Auror running the investigation. Abner was a polite, thorough man, but he had been at Azkaban nearly all night, and only had a five hour reprieve before putting in another six hour day at the island. Even the cloak he wore couldn't protect him fully, and throughout his explanation, Percy watched his exposure pin turn from burnt orange to scarlet.

Abner, who did look quite pale, retired for the night, and his second in command, Tim Calloway, finished for him. Calloway spoke far more candidly than his superior.

"Most of the guards hated Malfoy," he said frankly. "Over half have at least one Muggle parent, and most of them are practically Squibs. It's not like you need a lot of magic ability to work here, not unless you're a response guard in charge of chasing after runaways, and it's not like there are any of them. Anyway, we've sixty guards and various workers that were here when the body made like a rabbit in a hat. Twenty of them said they wouldn't mind setting the corpse on fire, or any other such shenanigans. I can get you the suspect list and profiles if you'd like."

"I would like to see for myself," said Percy.

And Calloway got him the files, all sixty of the present guards. Percy glanced through half before realizing that with nothing else to go on, it was worthless. He sat in on a few interrogations, just to make sure the questioning was thorough. Tierney always wanted Percy to know personally how official business was being carried out, and he never let Percy take anyone's word for it, not even chief Aurors. It was to wear him down even further.

Percy's pin was dark orange by seven o'clock, and he gratefully called it a day. He was walking to the entrance with Tim Calloway who, despite the near maroon of his pin, still managed to relate a humorous encounter while bodyguarding a Quidditch star. He had just given the punch-line, which sent him into bellows of laughter and made Percy smile, when the hallway dropped thirty degrees.

Percy saw his breath puff white in the cold, and then a Dementor glided by. The black hood didn't even turn his direction, but it felt like his heart was freezing over, and each consecutive beat grew more and more difficult. Shards of ice were stabbing through his heart, and flooding through his blood stream, pricking and slicing as it was pumped through his body.

He realized he must have collapsed when he looked up to see Tim Calloway's face over his own and then he closed his eyes.

He opened them and found himself lying across a few seats on the ferry. From the lack of freezing fear, they were halfway back to shore. Calloway was sitting beside him, munching a bar of chocolate. He reached into his robe and pulled out another one. He offered it to Percy.

"Thanks," said Percy, his voice cracking like an adolescent.

He pushed himself up and fumbled with the wrapper. The sky was dark, the air was cold, even inside the glass walls of the ferry, and Percy was exhausted. He was more than exhausted. He was pathetic. The country was in the hands of a mad man that Percy had to cater to, his family hated him, and the Civis Arma depended largely on the information Percy gave from the Minister's desk. But he couldn't even face a Dementor without fainting, what hope did he have of saving the world? What good was he? Did he really think he could help save the world? Did he even think it deserved to be saved? The world was a terrible, unwelcoming place. Why was he even trying? There would always be chaos and pain and tears. He might as well give up right now. He could walk to the rail of the boat, and jump, and no one would notice. It was all –

A warm wind suddenly blew through the boat at Percy blinked. It really wasn't so bad as all that. There was always hope, and even though it was cold, the stars were out and looking quite beautiful. And Percy was doing his best. He really was, and you know what, he was doing damn well if he said so himself.

His brain finally caught up with the sudden upswing and he glanced over to see that Calloway had taken his wand.

"Putting a charm, even a cheering spell, on someone without their permission is a misdemeanor," said Percy. He was grinning when he said it. Even crime was funny when he was this happy.

"Yeah, well, either you have never tasted chocolate so good, or you were going into a depressive fit which would probably land you in St. Mungos psych ward for attempted suicide," said Calloway, and then he gestured to Percy's face.

Percy reached up and felt that his cheeks were wet and his eyes were stinging. He wiped them away and took a healthy bite of chocolate.

"Weren't you one of those people who passed out at the Ministry?" asked Calloway. "I thought all of you were deemed 'Sensitive' now. What are you doing at Azkaban of all places?"

"My boss is a bastard," Percy confided. His cheeks were hurting. He hadn't smiled like this since he left his parents' house after graduation.

Next to him, Calloway choked on his chocolate. "You just called the Minister…," and then he broke into a bout of hearty laughter. That made Percy giggle, and he quickly covered his mouth.

"I think maybe I over did the charm," said Calloway. "Sorry about that, but if I used mine, it would have shown up on a prior incantum, which is mandatory for Aurors after visiting Azkaban and even though this is perfectly legal, it's a lot of paper work to fill out. Hope you don't mind."

He handed the wand back.

"No, it's perfectly-," and then Percy cut off because his memory was triggered, and suddenly it was all rushing back to him.

"Sweet Merlin," he breathed.

"What? Is it not alright?" asked Calloway. "I'm real sorry if-,"

"No, it's fine," said Percy. "I just remembered…"

"Remembered what?" asked Calloway.

Percy remembered seeing Tierney's wand when he cast the Patronus charm. He remembered seeing the hazel wand in the candidate's hand and starting forward, because that wasn't Osmond Tierney's wand. He noticed things like that because security was another part of his job. Tierney's wand was a dark mahogany, and shorter, much shorter than this wand.

"Shit," said Percy.

He had often wondered how anyone, much less Tierney, would have managed to pull off a Patronus with that many Dementors. Maybe a guard at Azkaban could, after years of training. Maybe Harry Potter could have, because apparently he was the golden boy. Maybe Dumbledore. But Tierney? And a griffin was his Patronus? Please.

Now he saw it. Tierney hadn't used the Patronus. He had cast a Prior charm while saying 'Expecto Patrunum' out loud, a difficult thing to manage, speaking one curse and casting another, but infinitely easier than casing the Patronus at a roomful of Dementors.

"Shit," said Percy again.

Tierney had been in on the attack. He must have planned the entire thing, working with Voldemort so that he could come out the hero. The Dementors had been ordered to run from the ghost of the Patronus. The country really was in the hands of a mad man.

"You know, you're really starting to freak me out here," said Calloway.

Percy looked over and smiled. "Don't worry," he said. "In a couple of days, everything will turn out alright."

Because he knew someone who would want Tierney out of office even more than he did. And he was pretty sure this certain someone would be the only person who could manage to overthrow the Minister of Magic.

OOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOO

28. The Malfoy Estate

oOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOo

It was a cold day. A few flakes of snow drifted invisibly down from the drab grey sky. Draco drove down the deserted, narrow road that was nearly overgrown by black, leaveless trees. The road curved suddenly, and there it was, the great iron gate that guarded the Malfoy Estate. The house itself was impossible to see from beyond the gate. In fact, all that was visible was the continuing road, the same bleak landscape.

The gates swung in for him. He was the rightful master now, and the wards opened at his presence. Draco drove through and the world changed. He retracted the roof on the convertible because here, here it was summer. It was summer year round. The clouds were cleared, and only the whitest, fullest clouds remained to drift across the blue sky. The woods here were brown and green, a wild tangle of trees, bushes and vines. A few wild flowers provided a burst of color.

The road curved again, just beyond the gate, and the woods cleared to green, short grass, and there was the Malfoy Manor, sprawled before him. It was constructed centuries ago, when less-than legal dealings forced the family to seek refuge across the channel. The Malfoy family was notorious for bouncing between England and France, leaving whenever they had caused enough upset in one country. The almost-palace was constructed mainly of light grey stone that shone silver in the sun. There was no symmetry to the wings of the home, but even the most recent additions looked to be generations old, but still perfectly preserved.

The rolling lawn was perfectly trimmed, dotted with flowing fountains surrounded by gardens of blooming flowers. A few trees were allowed to grow, stretching impossibly high to weave in the light breeze.

Draco stopped the car on the drive and closed his eyes, wondering if it would feel differently now that it was his, and now that he was alone. He couldn't tell because he was fighting the impulse to laugh, to jump out of the car and take off his shoes and run in the grass as he had as a child. He was home.

He inhaled the scent of gardenia and rose and grass, and then opened his eyes. There would be time to take it in later. Right now he had an hour to make sure the Floo's hadn't been hexed by the evicted Death Eaters and to see to the accounts before Bill and the rest of the Order descended, wanting to tour the Malfoy home. He had offered, of course, to show them but he hadn't thought so much interest would be garnered.

He pressed the accelerator and sped down the cobblestone drive to the grand entrance. He parked outside the wide marble steps and slowly got out of his car. He gazed up at the huge golden doors, inscribed with the Malfoy crest and the ancient runes that kept the enemy out. He slowly walked up the steps and the doors swung open.

The sight was breathtaking, even for him. The high, gilded and painted ceiling, the smooth, perfect marble floor spattered with gold, the two curved marble staircases on each side of the room, the jeweled archway leading to the ballroom, the silk and gold tapestries, and the enormous, sparking chandelier, dripping in diamonds and pearls. Draco very rarely used this entrance. It was saved for festivals and banquets, and he had attended very few as a child. Still, he remembered watching from the hallway that bordered the room from above. When Lucius would return after weeks overseas, only to be occupied with a banquet or a ball, Draco would creep from his bed to watch the guests arrive and to spot his father among them. Lucius always knew when he was there, and always looked up with a small smile. Draco looked up now, finding the posts he would peer between, wondering if some ghost of him remained there, still waiting for his father to come home once more.

"Is master needing anything?"

Draco looked down to the house elf which had appeared beside him without so much as a sound. The elf was wrapped in a clean towel, waiting for instructions with a bowed head.

"I trust all of the guests have left?" he asked.

"Yes, master. Though not nicely. They managed to destroy the west parlor before Tolly and the others were able to banish them. Tolly is sorry, master. Tolly will punish himself if master sees fit."

"That's not necessary, Tolly," said Draco absently. He hadn't thought the Death Eaters would leave quietly. Still, the damage didn't matter as long as they didn't leave anything damaging behind. "Did they leave any curses?"

"No, master. The house did not allow it."

"Have the other elves check anyway, particularly the fireplaces," said Draco. "We will be having guests at eleven. They'll probably want to see most of the house, well, the East and North wings at least. I trust they are presentable?"

"Yes, master. Perfectly in order."

"We may also be wanting lunch, tea at the very least. Tell the kitchen to prepare."

"Yes, master."

Draco nodded, then looked back down to the elf.

"Is mother around?" he asked.

"She is away, master. Should Tolly revoke her admittance to the house?"

So much for the house staff not knowing any family secrets. Draco would have liked to say yes, that Narcissa would never again set foot on the grounds, not when Lucius had given him the estate, but Lucius had loved Narcissa. He sighed.

"Just, send word if she should arrive."

"Yes, master."

"That's all," said Draco.

The elf bowed and disappeared.

Draco took the staircase on the right and traveled up to the halls that overlooked the entrance. Here there were several small parlors, a larger sitting room, a drawing room and a music room, a hallway leading to the guest wing, and another corridor that led to the rest of the estate, off limits for anyone who was not family or uninvited. Several wards made sure of that.

Draco passed through those wards and onto the more familiar halls and rooms. He had grown up here, running down halls that carried millions of galleons worth in gilded portraits, painted landscapes, and bejeweled candelabra that lighted the way at night. Now, though, the heavy drapes were pulled back from large French windows that ran the hall and the sun streamed in. There were no sinister depictions of the Dark Ages, no flaming torches lighting dank stone passage ways like so many people supposed. The Malfoy home was not representative of their dark dealings. It had been a warm place to grow up in. Draco preferred their French home, of course, but the English counterpart had not been an unwelcoming place.

The first order of business was not one Draco was looking forward to starting. Not because it was distasteful, but because of what it entailed. He stopped outside of his father's private study and rested his fingertips against the smooth dark wood. The business papers and ledgers were kept in Lucius' desk, and while he could simply have Tolly bring the necessary papers to him, he disliked admitting to cowardice.

He took a breath and opened the door.

Compared to the rest of the house, the study was nearly minimalistic. It was spacious, but not overly large. It held a great deal of windows, but the heavy drapes were hanging shut, minimizing the light. The study was silent, still, and dark, and Draco thought of a crypt. He deliberately took a step into the room.

Closed cabinets lines the lower wall, and open shelves took up the rest of the wall space. These shelves held books, magic detectors, pictures and antiques. Nothing was purely for decoration, but even the useful objects were selected for their style.

He hesitantly approached the large desk. There were still papers out, with his father's bold calligraphy running over the expanse. Draco brushed his fingers over the script without a conscious decision to do so.

Had Lucius been working on this before he was arrested?

Draco shoved that thought from his mind, and then pushed the papers to the side. He needed the ledgers, that was it.

He pulled open the first drawer and took out the thin books bound in deep green leather. He didn't dare look over the accounts here, not when the room was thick with his father's presence.

Draco left the study, walking quicker than was absolutely necessary, the books clenched tightly in his hands. He walked down to the sun parlor, where three of the four walls boasted large bay windows, and sat at the glass-and-gold table that matched the walls and carpeting. Here, in the sunlight, ghosts were unable to enter. He opened the books.

He had a little less than an hour before the others would be arriving, plenty of time to review the present status of the Malfoy businesses. As expected, there had been a dramatic fall in trade, due to the Minister's assassination, but from what Draco was looking at, it didn't seem to be a permanent loss. In fact, he already had a few plans forming that might reverse the current decline.

"Tolly," he spoke aloud.

The elf appeared immediately. "Yes, master?" he asked.

"Fetch me writing supplies," said Draco, then as an afterthought, "please."

"Right away, sir," said Tolly. His service was prompt. Three seconds later, and Draco had before him any writing utensil he could ever require.

Half an hour into his work, a coffee tray appeared on the table as well. Draco poured himself a mug and absent-mindedly sipped it while he finished familiarizing himself with the business report. He would have completed the review before Bill and the others came over, but not ten minutes after he received his coffee, an aggrieved Tolly burst into the room.

"I told him to wait, master, but still he comes!"

Draco raised his eyebrow, and then Bill came into the room, grinning ruefully.

"One hour," said Draco. "You couldn't even wait an hour?"

Bill shrugged. "I worry," he said. "I was also really curious." He looked about the room and shook his head. "This house is incredible. I had no idea you were this rich. It explains a lot actually."

Draco rolled his eyes but turned back to his books. "I still have fifteen minutes," he said. "Where's everyone else?"

"I think Fred and George wanted to find your dungeons, but we're keeping them corralled in…well, what ever room it was we came out in. It's big and mostly blue. A lot of pictures, a huge chandelier. I had to walk a full minute to get to here."

"The blue parlor," Draco said.

"Creative name," said Bill.

"It's really more of a waiting room for guests who arrive early for a banquet or ball," said Draco. He reluctantly put down his papers.

"We can wait," said Bill. "We were the ones arriving early after all."

"Etiquette requires the immediate attention to the guests," said Draco. He turned to the house elf who had retreated to the wall, waiting for instructions. "Tolly, please clear the table. I will be taking our guests on a tour. We would like lunch when we are finished, in the conservatory dining room."

"Yes, master," said the house elf.

Draco and Bill walked back towards the grand entrance. The Weasley family, Sirius, Hermione, and Harry were waiting for him there. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley looked as if they hardly dared to stand on the carpet, much less sit in the furniture. Fred and George were fiddling with a few antiques and Hermione was glancing through the small bookshelf. Ginny was studying a portrait of his grandfather Abraxas. Her nose was scrunched as she peered at the wizard who was holding absolutely still, refusing to acknowledge her presence.

"He doesn't talk much," Draco said, coming to stand beside her. "Most portraits here are rather immobile, but from choice."

"Do you suppose you'd get neck cramps if you were a portrait?" asked Ginny.

Draco quirked his lips. "I very much doubt it," he said.

"Hey, Malfoy," Fred called. "Can we see your dungeons?"

"Yeah, and all the secret passages," George added.

Draco turned and saw Ron's face. He felt the same way. Having been a prisoner in his own home, and having a knife run through his arm, was not something he wanted a reminder of.

"We'll be skipping the dungeon part of the tour today. But I can show you the armory, and the room where the great-great-great-great grandson of Salazar Slytherin was murdered."

By the looks of Fred and George, that was a perfectly acceptable tradeoff.

So Draco led them through the Malfoy home, telling a few childhood stories as he went in order to combat the opulence of the rooms. They toured the armory and murder site, as he promised Fred and George, and the ballroom, the banquet dining room, the main library – which Hermione nearly refused to leave – a few of the best parlors, the concert room, the public study, and then, when they began to realize exactly how much money he had – which had not been his intent with the tour at all – he took them outside to see the front garden.

A beautiful garden appealed to everyone, and this was one of the best in England. It was a rose garden, with white stone pathways and pleasantly splashing fountains. It was calming, or it was until a carriage clattered up the drive pulled by the family's thestrals. It was Narcissa.

Draco started for the carriage.

"Who is it?" Bill called.

"Just wait there," Draco ordered.

The carriage stopped in front of the grand entrance and Narcissa emerged, drowning in her jewels and unsteady on her feet. Her dress was crumpled, meaning she was just arriving from a party last night, and by her lack of balance and blood shot eyes, she was still drunk. A surge of hatred nearly blinded him and he clenched his fists to keep from going for his wand.

"Father's dead and you can't even pretend to mourn his passing?" he demanded, his voice smooth and frozen with anger.

"Why should I? Apparently he left everything to you. I knew I should have divorced him when I had the chance at alimony," said Narcissa. "Oh, and look. You've invited the family he loved so dearly. Your father's not even in a grave, and already you're tainting his house with such filth."

Her voice rose, and must be carrying over to the garden. This was not the place to finally confront the woman who had given birth to him.

"Let's move inside and discuss a settlement," said Draco. "While I will not provide you with a yearly income, I will provide you with a house and enough for a comfortable living."

"So you're cutting me off, is that it? You ungrateful bastard; I'm your mother! I should have known you'd be just like him."

Her voice was a screech. There was no doubt her words were audible from the garden. Draco forced himself to bite back a retort.

"Narcissa, let's take this inside." He reached out, touching her shoulder to guide her towards the stairs. She whirled on him and her hand struck out. It smacked against his cheek with a crack, whipping his head to the side.

"I deserve his fortune!" Narcissa spat. "I put up with him for twenty years, and this is the thanks I get? Nothing?"

Draco turned to her, eyes blazing.

"Lucius should have thrown you out to the street like the whore you are. And I will do what he should have done, if you do not leave right now. Come back when you're sober, mother. We'll talk then."

Narcissa stared at him, her eyes wide and aghast, finally realizing that Draco was not going to give in as Lucius had. "But...but I have no where to go."

Draco sighed. "Just, find a hotel. I'll cover it and your living, but that is all. No drugs, no jewels, no trips to Italy. Find one of your lovers to buy you expensive things."

Narcissa glared, but climbed back into the carriage. "You'll be hearing from my lawyers," she threatened as she left.

Draco didn't respond, but let the carriage drive away. He didn't want to see her again.

"Draco?"

He turned to see Bill standing at the side of the road, concern evident in his expression.

"She's leaving," said Draco.

"She hit you."

"She's drunk. And lacking a fortune to spend."

"Those aren't excuses."

"I know," said Draco. He sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "Can we just pretend that didn't happen? I've got too much to deal with right now."

"You have a red mark on your face."

Draco rubbed the spot. "It'll fade. Come on. Lunch is probably ready by now." And he set off for the rest of the group, determined to say nothing more on the matter.

They were all waiting for him, but trying to look like they hadn't just witnessed a family argument.

"You said something about lunch," said Sirius. He was the only one who wasn't awed by the house, and the only one completely unfazed by the appearance of Narcissa Malfoy.

Draco was thankful for the directed conversation. "Of course," he said. "This way."

It was a short walk to the conservatory, but it took longer for conversation to return to normal. The lunch didn't help at first. It was a fancy meal, fancier than Draco had expected, and Tolly had wanted to serve it in courses, but Draco made him put all the platters out at once. The elf was distraught at the idea, mostly due to the fact that this was the first meal Draco was having as the new master, and he had guests with him as well. It took several minutes of gentle convincing, and the promise to have a real party in the near future, and Tolly finally caved. The almost-fight with the house-elf caused several chuckles from his guests even though it flustered him more

Still, once the food was served and people began to eat, the tension eased. It was hard to remain anxious while dining from the Malfoy kitchen.

"Your place is wicked," said Ron, around a bite of salmon halfway through the meal.

"You live in a palace," said Harry. "You grew up in a palace."

"More of a chateau, really," said Draco. "It's in the country, not the city."

"Chateau," Ron snorted. "No wonder you're an arrogant snot."

"Thank you," said Draco.

"Oh, shove off," said Ginny, coming to his defense. She turned to Draco and leaned in. "So, can I get a tour of your room?" she asked in a lowered, teasing voice. Her mother still heard.

"Ginny!" she exclaimed, completely scandalized.

Bill laughed, but the rest of her brothers turned a wary glance his way.

Tolly appeared at his side, creating a welcome diversion.

"This just came for you master," he said, holding out a letter.

"Thank you, Tolly," said Draco, accepting the envelope. He frowned at the lack of the sender's name, and at the message scrawled across the front.

'Your eyes only'.

"Excuse me," he said. He nodded and then ducked into the hall that led to the rest of the house. He slid his finger underneath the seal and scanned the short message.

Draco,

We must meet. Soon if possible. Floo to my study at your earliest convenience. I'll duck out and meet you there.

Percy

p.s. My condolences for the loss of your father.

Percy, the Minister's Assistant, was going to duck out of work to meet Draco at his convenience? It must be important.

Draco reentered the room.

"Leaving?" asked Bill, identifying the look on his face.

"Something came up that requires my immediate attention," said Draco, addressing the group. "Enjoy your lunch, and stay as long as you'd like."

"That might be for a long time, mate," said Ron. "Your place is significantly nicer when there aren't any Death Eaters around."

Draco quirked his lips. "Agreed," he said.

"When will you be back?" asked Bill.

"Not sure. Probably no more than an hour." He didn't think Percy could really excuse himself for that long.

"Alright. We'll see you back at the Order then. An hour," said Bill.

"And I'll Floo if I'm going to be late, I know," said Draco. He nodded to the table and left for the pearl parlor by the side entrance which held the nearest fireplace with a Floo service. He stepped through and out into Percy's private office, which was exactly the same as he remembered it, even down to the planner on the desk and the number of quills in the brass holder. Percy Weasley was most definitely a little obsessive-compulsive.

Draco settled into one of the chairs in front of the fireplace, not knowing how long it would be until Percy could escape work. He would have been notified at Draco's arrival, through some magical signal, but the Assistant was a busy man.

Draco was surprised when Percy appeared at his desk by Portkey not two minutes later.

"Malfoy," he said with a smile. "So glad you could come on such short notice. Do you want any tea? Coffee?"

"No, thank you," said Draco.

"Right, well, give me a moment, and I'll explain everything."

It was clear that the serious Weasley boy was exhausted. Draco figured Tierney was trying to work him into quitting or death – which ever was faster – but Percy appeared to be in surprisingly good spirits. He had smiled at Draco in greeting and he was humming under his breath as he waited for the kettle to boil. He must be excited about something.

He was, however, still drinking hollymint tea for muscle tension.

"Good news, then, I take it," said Draco.

"Quite good," said Percy. He poured his cup of tea and then joined Draco by the fireplace. Draco impatiently waited for him to settle in the chair.

"I had a moment of revelation," said Percy. He took a sip of tea. "My memory was a bit hazy after the Dementor attack at the debate, but luckily, a further run-in with the Dementors down at Azkaban triggered a few of those memories, one in particular you might find interesting."

Draco was surprised to hear that Percy had been at Azkaban, and didn't think Percy would have had to attend to the suicide investigation of Lucius personally, but he didn't pry.

"What memory?" he asked instead.

"The wand Osmond Tierney used to fend off the Dementors at the debate was not his wand," said Percy.

"Are you sure?" asked Draco.

"Absolutely positive," said Percy. "I'll testify under Veritaserum, if it comes down to it."

"Testify, in a court of law?" asked Draco.

"Well, I was thinking that in the copious amounts of spare time I have," said Percy dryly, "and thought I might just have the Minister arrested after my lunch break." He took another sip of tea and then twisted his neck to the side. Several vertebrae popped loudly. Percy continued, seriously this time. "I actually wouldn't want to testify against Tierney, or even bring charges, because then I would have broken my oath to support the Minister in every capacity, and while I would be legally justified to take him to court - ,"

"It's unlikely you would be able keep your position as Assistant," Draco finished. "And you need to stay in your position for the Civis Arma."

"Precisely," said Percy.

"So, instead, you want me to accuse the Minister and bring him to justice without using your testimony which is probably the only proof we have of the switch."

Percy nodded, and then grinned. It threw Draco for a moment, to see such a Weasley smile on the usually stern face. He had started thinking of Percy as his own entity, not related to the other red-heads at all. Now, though, the resemblance was striking.

"What do you say, Draco?" he asked. "Up for a challenge?"

"I will have to call on you if this doesn't go as smoothly as I hoped," Draco cautioned.

"But last resort only."

"Of course," Draco promised. Already he was thinking about the possibilities, his brain flooded with laws and courts and various prosecution aspects of the trial.

"Think you can do it?" Percy asked curiously.

Draco nodded, his lips turning into a smirk. "I think so," he said.

"Good," said Percy. "Then I'm not going to bother going back to the trade meeting. He can yell all he wants." He put his feet up on a footstool and slouched a little in the armchair. "You'd better get him, Malfoy," he said seriously, "because I'm barely surviving him as it is. I won't last 'til the end of his term. I don't even know if I would last another month."

Draco studied Bill's brother, taking in the pale features and black circles under his eyes.

"Would you like to be Minister?" he asked suddenly.

"What?" asked Percy.

"Say I depose Tierney. Would you like to be Minister?"

"The Assistant can't run for office. It's to prevent assassinations."

"No, I know," said Draco. "But you could quit, right now. And then, afterward Tierney's gone, run for Minister. I'd back you. I'm not the best of political allies to have right now, but I could probably help you win the elections."

Percy laughed. "Me? Minister? Malfoy, there is no way I'm ready for that. Yes, I know how the Ministry works, and I know how to conduct trade talks and what tax benefits are needed to promote growth in specific areas of the economy, but I am not ready to take on the fate of England. I can handle the bureaucratic bullshit, but I couldn't make decisions for an entire country. The thought honestly terrifies me. Give me another decade, and maybe, but there's no way I'd want to be Minister right now."

Draco could see his objection. The third-eldest Weasley was obviously a perfectionist. In such a powerful position, he could easily drive himself mad.

"We'll talk in ten years then," he said.

"Ten years," said Percy, raising his cup of tea in a salute. "If I'm not permanently retired and living as a hermit in Scotland by then."

Draco smirked and got up.

"Malfoy," said Percy, "if you are going to support some new candidate for Minister, just make sure he's a decent one. If not, I swear I'll freeze your accounts until Merlin returns."

"Understood," said Draco.

oOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOo-oOoOoOoOoOoOo

Draco was true to his word and Flooed back to the Order an hour after he left on whatever mysterious business he had. Bill tried to ask him about it, but Draco evaded his questions and then locked himself in his study. He refused to even take a break for dinner.

Bill would have been worried, but Draco assured him, through the closed door, that he was fine and yes, he would explain tonight, and Bill should probably contact Dumbledore as well to hear what the secret was. So Bill contented himself with an audible sigh outside the door and busied himself until Dumbledore arrived.

The Headmaster Flooed over at eight-thirty, along with McGonagall and Snape. Kingsley and Tonks arrived a few minutes later, and Remus appeared at nine, apologizing for being so tardy. Molly was ready with tea and cake, even though this was an informal Order meeting, and the dessert brought the rest of the family down as well. Once they were all served, Dumbledore turned to Bill.

"So, where is our resident genius?" he asked.

Bill shrugged. "He said he'd be out."

"I am," said Draco, coming in from the hall. He slid into the seat next to Ginny and Bill, a seat that was now exclusively his, and accepted the piece of cake from Mrs. Weasley. He poured himself a mug of tea, keeping them all in suspense. His lips quirked into a smirk and his eyes shone with an odd light. That odd light Bill associated mainly with Lord Draco.

"Draco?" he asked.

Draco took a sip of tea and then announced, "I'm suing the Minister."

Bill blinked. Draco ignored the silence and took a bite of cake. It was odd, seeing Draco eat the sweet dessert without picking at it first or being prodded to eat, but he had skipped dinner. Bill considered Draco, saw he was serious, and then looked around the table to see that everyone was just as surprised as he was, but he had far more experience dealing with the teen genius.

"Okay," he said. "What do you hope to accomplish with suing the Minister?"

"It's a bit complicated," said Draco, which Bill took to mean that no mere mortal had a hope to understand his convoluted thought processes, "but the basic idea is to get the Minister on the stand under Veritaserum and then force him to admit that he was behind the Dementor attack at the debates."

"But he wasn't behind the attack," Ginny pointed out. "Voldemort was, and Tierney will be under Veritaserum."

"No, I know that," said Draco. "I actually will just allude to the fact that he was behind the attacks. He'll only admit to knowing about the attack and switching wands while under Veritaserum, and the rest will be implied in the subsequent trials."

There was more silence. Bill watched Draco eat more of his cake with a very self-satisfied look on his face. Bill had never seen Draco purposefully flaunt his intelligence, but sometimes Draco liked to be vague and annoyingly obtuse. Usually when he had a flash of genius and wanted the satisfaction of figuring it out.

"Alright," said Bill, knowing Draco wouldn't explain further until asked. "What's the basis for the trial at least?"

"That Lucius Malfoy was wrongly convicted for his assassination of Minister Fudge," said Draco.

Yes, Draco was definitely being obscure on purpose now. Bill had no doubt that a smarter man could follow the genius's train of the thought and ambiguous statements, but right now he was at a loss, as was the entire table. Well, Dumbledore was twinkling, but he wasn't offering any sort of clarification.

"But Lucius did kill Fudge," said Ron, very slowly, as if he was afraid of sounding stupid by stating a fact.

"I didn't say I was going to sue because he was innocent, just that he was wrongly convicted. Of course, the idea is to convey, at least to Tierney, that I am trying to prove Lucius' innocence to keep him off the real game."

"Which is?" Sirius prodded.

"To get him to admit that knew about the attacks," said Draco.

And then Draco waited, eyebrows raised, as if he sincerely expected them to connect the dots without any sort of numbering system. Bill watched, in amusement, as Draco transitioned from smug superiority with his deliberately incomprehensible explanations to frustration when no one understood after his big reveal. Well, Dumbledore was still twinkling, and Ginny, who wanted to go into law, had her head cocked to the side, like she was almost ready to solve the puzzle.

"It's a little complicated," Draco allowed, "but it's not rocket science."

"What's rocket science?" asked Ron.

"Space shuttles," said Draco. "Avionics and orbital mechanics and escape velocity."

"Oh," said Ron. "So is it true that the Muggles landed on the moon?"

Bill nearly laughed at Draco's disbelieving expression, but he managed to swallow the urge.

"Yes," said Draco. "The Muggles landed on the moon. And they now have a space station orbiting the Earth."

"But…but how?" asked Ron.

Draco ignored the question. "It'll work," he told the rest of the table. "And once Tierney is convicted, we can look for a new candidate for office. You'll just have to trust me on this one. Can you do that?"

An odd question coming from Draco, but Bill smiled. It was proof that Draco was recovering from his isolated and deprived childhood.

"Absolutely, my boy," said Dumbledore. He was twinkling so hard he was practically shining.

"Sure," said Sirius, with a shrug.

Even Arthur and Molly nodded.

"Genial," said Draco, in a rare moment of French. Bill saw his lips twitch, like he wanted to smile.

"So what's first?" asked Ginny.

"First, I get you your dinner," said Molly to Draco. "You can't work on an empty stomach."

"I'm fine," said Draco.

"Nonsense. I saved a plate specifically for you," said Molly, and then she bustled into the kitchen.

"So," said Ginny again. "What's first?"

"We have to make it public," said Draco. "This trial has to have everyone watching."

"That won't be hard," said Kingsley. "It is the Minister and you're a rather public figure at the moment, and still under inquiry."

Bill saw Draco grimace at that, but the blond pressed on. "We're going to need huge publicity from the very beginning. That's the only thing that's going to make Tierney agree to the Veritaserum."

"He has to agree to it?" asked Hermione.

"And we will only be able to ask certain, specific questions that he and his cabinet have approved. For national security reasons."

Bill frowned. "But that means he can easily tell the truth without admitting to anything."

"Exactly," said Draco. "And we're also going to need to distract Tierney from our actual plan of attack. We can't have him know which direction we're taking the trial."

Bill could see the rest of the Order looked as confused and frustrated as he felt.

"Draco," he said. "How about you explain this to us from the very top. Use tiny words."

Draco nodded, his cheeks flushing oh-so-slightly. "Sorry," he said. "Alright, so here's the plan…"

oOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOo

So, it's a bit shorter than other chapters, but it was a good stopping point, and I want the trial to play out by itself. That'll be in the next chapter in two weeks. Please leave a review!





29. The Trial of the Century

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. If I did, I wouldn't have to worry about moving down to grad school. I would hire people to build me an apartment and move my stuff. Preferably while I'm lying on the couch.

Author's note: Guess what? I'm alive. Sorry about the wait. I didn't realize what a hassle it was to graduate. And now I have to find an apartment for grad school and move. Wow. Rather intense, but also exciting. Anyway, without further ado, the chapter that took too long to post….

oOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOo

England's magical courthouse, the House of Law, had been built in 1408, sanctioned by the Minister Archibald Fenmaster. During his reign, he had been known as the Right Arm of the Law, Father of Justice, and Honest Archy. The courthouse was the greatest construction of the time and was still heralded as the pinnacle of wizarding architecture. Seven enormous pillars, representing the seven virtues, graced the front of the courthouse above fifteen marble steps, representing the Fifteen Steps to Illumination, as described by Mage Tau. Stained glass windows, depicting the capture, trial, and execution of the infamous Pieter Paracelsius, were set on each side of the hall.

Inside were three courtrooms. The room on the right was for civil disputes. The left for criminal cases. In the middle was the largest room, used for the swearing in of the Cabinet and other government officials. In this room, right above the Judge's desk, the portrait of Archibald Fenmaster hung for a grand total of three years after his death.

In the fourth year after his demise, documents surfaced linking him to the death of several Ministry administrators, the bribery of an entire department of Aurors, and the criminal organization Black Thorne. His portrait was moved to a holding cell in the House of Law and had stayed there ever since. It was reported that the portrait hadn't stopped laughing yet.

Draco ignored the constrained chaos behind him. He was in the third courtroom, a large, grand room with polished wood floors and walls. Now, above the Judge's desk was a large painting of the Lady Justice, eyes covered by a shining white cloth that gently blew in the breeze. Her expression was serene, even with the near roar of the crowd in the audience's chamber.

Draco sat at the prosecuting table, separated from the crowd only by a waist high banister. He could just make out the voices of the most popular radio broadcasters, shouting into their microphones in order to be heard for their listeners at home. Most of the Ministry was in attendance, and instead of behaving in a calm manner, as befitting of their stations, most were talking excitedly. This was the trial of the century after all.

Normally, the wizarding media was not present during a trial, but the Ministry had been unable to keep the reporters out. The Minister was accused, and the public demanded a right to follow the case. And not all of the Ministry wanted to keep the media attention low. Draco knew that Tierney had pushed for media coverage, despite the misgivings of the cabinet and Wizengamot. Tierney was confident that he would be acquitted; he wanted all of England to witness his triumph.

The Wizengamot had conceded, but only allowed a few select reporters to be in attendance. The rest of the audience was made up of Ministry officials and those who were able to cash in on a favor. Draco had been allowed to admit a few guests into the audience. Dumbledore had procured his own admittance, and so Draco had admitted the rest of the Weasley family along with Harry, Hermione, and Sirius. They were sitting in the back of the room, with the rest of the non-government guests. Draco wished they were sitting behind him, but only for the noise buffer. He glanced over at Ginny who was seated beside him.

He had made her his partner, knowing that she would want to participate in the trial. She wasn't as nervous as he thought she would be, but she had admitted that the clothes he had bought for her helped. She looked extremely professional, in a deep purple skirt and robe suit. Her hair was twisted into a smooth French twist, a look that was becoming, but he liked her hair down and wavy.

She looked over, catching his eyes, and flashed him a small smile. He smirked back and then resumed his position staring forward. Three days of preparation had brought him here, and he was ready.

Three days ago he had strode into the Ministry of Magic with two Aurors flanking him, trying to keep up with him as he crossed the crowded Atrium and rode the elevators to the Minister's floor. He had been announced into the hall outside of the Minister's office, marched over to Percy Weasley's desk, and dropped the court summons in front of the 'surprised' Assistant.

"I'm suing the Minister," he announced, "for the wrongful arrest and execution of my father Lucius Malfoy. I am sure I will be hearing from your lawyers."

And then he had left, leaving the floor in stunned silence behind him. The court summons had originally been for the very next day, but it was the Minister he was up against. Certain aspects of the trial had to be specifically tailored for such a sensitive case and that took time. He hadn't minded the wait. It gave him ample time to plan.

Draco sat up straighter as the door beside the Judge's stand opened and the bailiff stepped through in the traditional navy robes.

"Please rise for His Honour Judge Whitman," he announced.

The clamor initially increased, as the audience rose, but then the voices fell silent in anticipation. Draco took a breath as he stood and held it for a moment before releasing. He didn't need to worry. Even if his first plan failed, there was still Percy Weasley's testimony. The Judge appeared, his black robes impeccably pressed, his white curled wig in perfect place. He walked up the few steps to his stand and then sat.

Draco retook his seat, hearing the audience do the same. For the first time, he looked over to the defense table. Tierney sat smugly, surrounded by his team of lawyers. Draco looked back to the Judge. Whitman was taking his time, looking through the pages on his desk. He waited until the court squirmed in anticipation, the silence only broken by the soft whispers of the reporters into their microphones.

The Judge nodded to the bailiff who shut the back door and then strode to the center of the room, in front of the stand.

"This is case number three-seven-two-five-eight, Mr. Draco Malfoy against Minister Osmond Tierney. Court is now in session, the honorable Judge Whitman presiding."

The bailiff strode back to his corner. The Judge peered over the top of his stand to survey the courtroom.

"We are all aware of the significance of this case," he said. "And, while I understand the importance of the proceedings here today, if at any moment, the media becomes too much of a distraction, I will not hesitate to throw the whole lot of you out on account of disorderly conduct and sequester the hearing. I hope that is understood."

The Judge stared balefully at the audience and then looked back down at his papers.

"The inner court of the Wizengamot will be serving as jury today," he continued, and then looked up. Above the room, in a wrap around balcony, sat the inner court. They were a grave, silent group, staring down that the audience below.

"This is a delicate matter," said Whitman. "The Minister is privy to many confidential matters of great import to our nation's security. We obviously cannot have the Minister under Veritaserum answering sensitive questions. We will not be using the serum today, unless it is proven necessary. Instead, a Sterling Lie Detector will be put to use and the prosecutor will be limited to the questions he has already submitted to the court. If the prosecution wishes to ask a follow-up question, one which has not been cleared, the question must be submitted to the cabinet for deliberation. Mr. Malfoy," and now the Judge turned to him, "should you stray from the list of acceptable questions, you will be charged with treason. Are you aware of these consequences?"

Draco leaned forward to the voice amplifier sitting on his table. "Quite," he said dryly.

The audience behind him tittered nervously. The Judge silenced them with a glare.

Yesterday, Draco had received the edited list of questions he had sent in to the cabinet. All of his clever phrasings, the ones that would force Tierney into admitting his involvement in the Dementor attack, had been skillfully reworded. None of the questions would win his case. While Draco understood the need to protect the nation through the screening of the questions, he chafed under the restrictions because now it was being used to protect the guilty.

"If the Minister will come forward," said Whitman, "we'll jump right in."

Draco liked Judge Whitman. He had little tolerance for the posturing of lawyers and often tired of court etiquette, but he had never had a case declared a mistrial due to improper procedure. Draco was going to use that to his advantage.

Tierney took the stand, wearing his trademark pin-striped dress robes. His expression was calm, the tilt of his head arrogant. His eyes swept once towards Draco, his gaze black with threat.

"Bailiff," said Whitman.

The Bailiff stepped forward with the silver lie detector. He placed it on the banister in front of Tierney.

"Minister," said the Bailiff, "please place your wand at your heart."

Tierney raised his wand to his chest.

"Do you pledge to speak the truth with your heart and tongue?"

"I so pledge," said Tierney.

"Bailiff, commence with the preliminary examination questions."

And now it began. Three questions were to be asked. Two were to be answered truthfully, the third dishonestly, in order to ascertain the proper functioning of the lie detector.

"Minister, please answer truthfully," the Bailiff instructed. "What is your full name?"

"Osmond Cartier Tierney," said the Minister strongly.

The lie detector sent out a golden beam of light.

"Minister, please answer truthfully. What is your current occupation?"

"I am the Minister of Magic," said Tierney.

Again, the instrument glowed gold.

"Minister, on this question, please answer untruthfully. On which day were you born?"

"October tenth," said Tierney.

A brilliant red light shot out of the silver instrument. A lie.

"And now truthfully, Minister?"

"October ninth," said Tierney.

The light changed to gold.

"Advocate Cafferty," said Judge Whitman, "are you satisfied with the ability of this detector?"

Tierney's lawyer leaned forward to the voice amplifier. "I am satisfied."

"Mr. Malfoy, are you satisfied?"

Draco glanced at Tierney, then at his lawyer, and said, clearly, "No."

The Judge blinked in surprise and Cafferty turned his head to stare at him.

"The detector correctly indicated the falsehood, Mr. Malfoy," said Whitman.

"Yes, it did," Draco agreed.

"Then what complaint do you have?"

"The detector did not indicate a falsehood when it should have," said Draco. "The Minister's full name is Osmond Cartier Harold Tierney. He stopped using the name 'Harold' upon his graduation from Durmstrang, but never legally dropped it. When asked for his full name, he should have included 'Harold' in order to have given the full truth. Because he did not, the detector should have shown a falsehood."

"Are you requesting that the detector be registered as damaged?"

"No. I believe that the Minister truly regards his full name as Osmond Cartier Tierney. He believed his answer to be the truthful one, and that is all the detector can test."

"Then why are you unsatisfied?" asked Whitman, a trifle testily.

"Your Honour, it is court procedure that the witness, using a lie detector, answers two questions truthfully, and one untruthfully to ascertain that the detector is properly functioning. He did not, technically, answer two questions truthfully. Cases have been dismissed for smaller slights than this."

"And what is it you want?"

"A second preliminary question to be answered truthfully. If the cabinet could come up with another question, we can proceed without fear of attack from those who will examine every aspect of this trial. The question should be something that many people are witnessed to, so the truth is without debate. Something visible and powerful, so anyone who doubts the truth would obviously be demented."

"I am aware of what should constitute a safety question, Mr. Malfoy," said the Judge.

"I'm sorry, Your Honor," said Draco. "I don't mean to patronize."

The Judge gave him a sour look, but then looked to the members of the cabinet who were seated behind Tierney's lawyers.

"If the cabinet has no objections, I believe I can provide another preliminary question."

The cabinet leaned their heads together. While several members of the cabinet were supporters of Tierney's policies, none of them knew Tierney's true loyalties. It only took a moment for them to confer, and then John Kelly, Head of the Cabinet, stood.

"We have no objections, Your Honour."

And why would they? These preliminary checks were obvious questions with obvious answers. Whitman was a respected judge, privy to many state secrets himself. He had also served on the cabinet two decades ago. If the Judge said he had a question, they would allow it.

Here it was. It wasn't really Whitman's question, though the Judge would believe he had come up with it on his own. Draco had baited the question as much as he could, using the words 'debate', 'attack', 'demented' and 'patronize'. Tierney had proofed the interrogation questions, and so Draco had looked for another route to snare the Minister. His fingers flew in their pattern underneath the table as the Judge turned to Tierney.

"Minister, please answer truthfully," he said. "What is the form of your Patronus?"

And Draco couldn't help but smirk as Tierney's face blanched. The Minister turned cold eyes onto him as he realized Draco's trap. Draco's smirk widened as he floundered.

Tierney's pause grew. If the Minister maintained the silence any longer, suspicions would arise. Draco saw Tierney's eyes dart to the lie detector and his hands grasped the edges of his chair.

"A griffin," he said, staring at the lie detector, as if willing the instrument to shine gold. These detectors weren't foolproof, but only one skilled at Occlumency could mask their responses. Tierney was not so skilled. A red light shot into the air.

The courtroom fell silent.

"Minister," said Judge Whitman. "Could you repeat that?"

No one had realized yet that Tierney was lying. The more innocent answer, a defective detector, was the only answer the audience entertained at this moment.

"My Patronus is a griffin," Tierney repeated.

The red light did not waver.

"My Patronus is a griffin!"

Tierney turned to the Judge.

"The detector must be malfunctioning," he said. The pallor of his face betrayed his fear.

The Judge motioned the Bailiff forward. The Bailiff checked the lie detector as the whispers in the courtroom started.

"There is no damage," the Bailiff reported.

"Minister," said the Judge, "one more try, please answer truthfully."

"I am answering truthfully!" Tierney insisted. The red light shot up at those words.

Now the truth was dawning on the audience. The whispers grew; Tierney's face went from white to red.

"Minister, the day of the debate," the Judge began. "Did you release a griffin Patronus against the Dementors?"

And Tierney settled back in the seat, temporarily relieved.

"I did release a griffin Patronus," he said, and the lie detector let out the golden beam.

"But your Patronus is not a griffin," said the Judge, proving that he was fully deserving of his title.

"It is a griffin," said Tierney, and the light went red.

"Minister," said the Judge, "I will ask you one more time. If that lie detector does not show truth, I will order this court clear and send for the Veritaserum. What is the form of your Patronus?"

The court fell silent in anticipation. Draco knew half of the audience was holding their breath. He looked at Tierney, raising one eyebrow. Tierney met his gaze, knowing that Draco had won this game. His eyes never wavered as he answered.

"My Patronus is an asp," he said, and the lie detector sent out the gold ray.

Draco expected the uproar to start the second after that admission, but the audience was composed of Ministry officials. In this moment, they were realizing what this confession meant. The silence was a shocked and dreaded quiet.

Judge Whitman continued, his voice steely as he forced the Minister to recount his deeds.

"Did you cast the Patronus charm at the attack at the debate?"

"No," said Tierney, and now he looked away from Draco, towards the back of the courtroom. His expression twisted with hatred as he answered. "I cast a prior incantum on Board member Excelsior Gavin's wand to release the Patronus so I could appear to be fighting the Dementors."

"Did you know the Dementors would attack?"

"I didn't know the exact time, but yes, I knew they would be there. In fact, I helped the Dark Lord plan the skirmish."

Something was wrong. Draco sat up further, his eyebrows furrowed. Why was Tierney confessing so readily? This wasn't Tierney's style. Tierney wouldn't have admitted his actions without a battle. He should be trying to weasel his way out of the charges. He should be calling for a lawyer, or feigning a seizure, or finding some way to place the blame on another.

Draco twisted in his seat, glancing about the courtroom, not knowing exactly what he was looking for, but finding it when he saw an unobtrusive brunette sitting halfway back in the audience. He couldn't see her hands, but her expression was locked on Tierney and her mouth was whispering words. Draco recognized the use of the Imperius Curse.

Draco looked to Dumbledore, sitting only two rows away. He caught the Headmaster's gaze and looked meaningfully at the woman. Dumbledore followed his line of sight and he nodded. Draco cast one more look at the woman, memorizing her features, but then she turned, locking eyes with him, and Draco knew who she was.

Claire Jameson.

"I hope you all burn!" Tierney screamed from the stand.

Draco whipped around to the witness stand where Tierney was ripping off his watch.

"No!" Draco shouted.

Tierney threw the watch to the floor. There was an explosion, a deafening rush of sound, though Draco could make out the terrified screams of the audience beneath the cacophony. He lunged for Ginny, forcing her to the ground as he whisked out his wand. Flames leapt high, bursting forward in a blinding light. Draco shut his eyes against the bright, ceiling-high flames.

The light was oppressive, heating the entire room, scorching as they expanded out, quicker than a Firebolt. Before Draco could think of a single spell, the heat was gone, and the red of the inside of his eyelids fell to black. He carefully opened his eyes and turned his head to the witness stand where Tierney once stood. Now, the Minister was on the floor, singed and burnt, but moaning and writhing.

Behind Draco, the shrieks died out as the audience raised their heads. He turned to the back of the room, seeing a few cautious head peek up from the rows of chairs.

Three people stood tall, a woman and two men, their wands pointed at the witness stand. The woman pulled out a badge. She was short, with blonde hair cut in an attractive bob. Her voice was no-nonsense.

"Everyone, please remain calm. I am Auror Helena Greenwich, and these are my colleagues, Aurors George Parrish and Rudy Costace. If you will please regain your seats, we will take the Minister into custody, and then after the Judge dismisses the court, we will begin taking your statements. I thank you for the cooperation I'm sure you will give."

So, these must be part of the Civis Arma. Draco had to give them credit. They seemed to be quite prepared. He glanced towards Percy Weasley, who was doing an admirable job of gazing at the three Aurors in surprise. If he looked a little more shaken, like the rest of the audience, Draco might believe he really was unaware of the three Aurors undercover in attendance.

Draco got to his feet, scanning the room for Claire but not expecting to find her. She was nowhere to be seen. She had a way with escapes. Draco turned to offer a hand to Ginny, but she was already rising.

"Wow," she said.

oOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOo

Ginny got to her feet, ignoring the hand from Draco because she could stand up by herself. She liked the consideration though.

"Wow," was all she could think of to say.

Draco's lips quirked at that. She smiled back, wishing that she could take his hand or give him a kiss, because they nearly were incinerated, but she had a professional attitude to maintain. Maybe he had the same desire for some physical contact, or maybe he was just being courteous, but he righted her chair and held it out for her. When she sat, his hand brushed her shoulder.

He dragged his own chair back up to the table and they watched the Aurors pull Tierney to his feet and hustle him out the back door. When he was out of sight, Ginny turned around to see the rest of the courtroom nearly fully recovered. There were excited conversations and gestures of disbelief. The reporters were half-shouting into their microphones to be heard over the chaos.

Judge Whitman was conversing with the Bailiff and the woman Auror. The Judge's white wig was singed black and missing half of one side. He discarded it as he climbed once more to his stand. Without it, he had a severely receded hair line.

"Ladies and gentleman," he called, banging his gavel loudly. "Ladies and gentlemen, please, decorum!"

It took a few moments for the audience to fall silent and reclaim their seats.

"Ladies and gentlemen," said the Judge for the third time. "After the revelations in the case, the Minister has been arrested on account of treason and for planning and committing acts of violence against this country. He is hereby relieved of his duty as Minister of this country. An investigation of Mr. Tierney has begun and more information will be released as it is gathered." The Judge turned to Draco. "At this time, Mr. Malfoy, this case is suspended for the criminal trial of Osmund Tierney. You will be contacted when your case is ready to resume."

"Understood, Your Honour," said Draco.

"Mr. Weasley," the Judge continued.

Ginny was startled at the use of her family name and then looked over to see Percy sitting with the members of the cabinet. She hadn't seen him there. She had forgotten that he would be present. It was easy to forget about him, even though that thought made her feel guilty. But, in such a large family, absences, especially long ones, were covered by the noise of everyone else, and Percy had always been the quiet one.

Her brother stood, tall in conservative, but well-tailored robes of navy blue. His glasses and neat hair made him look older than his twenty-three years. Or was he twenty-four now? No, he must be twenty-three. She had to count up from her own age. Ron was almost eighteen. The twins were twenty. Percy was twenty-three.

Now Percy was looking at the Judge, quietly waiting, despite the fact that every eye was on him.

"Your Honour," he said.

"You are, once more, Acting Minister until another election can be held."

Acting Minister. It sounded so prestigious. Ginny knew there were a dozen restrictions and limitation for an Acting Minister, as opposed to a full one, but still, her brother, her twenty-three year old brother, was in charge of the entire country. And he didn't even look phased at the charge from the judge.

"Understood, Your Honour," was all he said.

Judge Whitman sent a small, grim smile in his direction.

"Mr. Weasley," he said again.

"Yes, Your Honour."

"Perhaps you ought to consider running for Minister next season. For re-election."

It was a dark sort of humor, if there was any other type of political humor. Nearly the entire audience chuckled, quietly and grimly. Ginny wondered if it was some sort of running joke in the office. Percy gave a wan smile.

"The court is dismissed," said the Judge, "but you will have to remain here for the time being. Aurors will be calling individuals out to take statements, and you can leave from there. We are adjourned." Whitman banged the gavel down.

The courtroom was filled with conversations once more. Ginny turned towards Draco, but then her attention was caught by the way the Judge stepped down from the stand and made his way over to Percy. In fact, several important officials were gathered around her brother and he seemed to be giving them instructions. Everyone was listening intently, nodding in agreement, sometimes speaking. When others did talk, Percy listened, appearing to be quite attentive. Ginny felt a stirring of pride for her brother. He looked like he belonged there.

Ginny glanced back, trying to see if her family was seeing Percy run the country. She would have stood on her tiptoes, but her heels were so high, she didn't think it was possible to get any higher. She finally spotted them, speaking to Dumbledore in the middle of the room. Bill waved to her, but no one glanced over to Percy, no one noticed.

She looked back at Percy.

"You can go over and say 'hi'," said Draco.

Ginny turned to her boyfriend. He shrugged, his fine robes rippling with the motion.

"The Aurors said you had to stay in the room, not that you were confined to your seat."

Ginny hesitated then shook her head.

"I can't go over now. It'll look bad."

Draco frowned.

"It'll look like I'm kissing up to him now that he's in charge," she elaborated. She didn't want Percy thinking she only cared about his position.

"You're all Gryffindors," said Draco. "Would he really think that?"

She shrugged. He probably wouldn't, but there was a chance. Percy knew she wanted to go into law. What if he thought she was just trying to use their sibling connection? She hadn't been able to talk to him when he was in the hospital. She was a Gryffindor, yes, but the thought of alienating her family because she sided with Percy scared her. Charlie walked the fence much better than she did.

So Ginny stared at Percy, wishing she had the guts to march right over and give him a hug. Or shake his hand, since that would be more professional. She didn't though.

Percy stilled and then looked over, as if sensing her gaze. He looked startled at catching her staring, just as startled as she was for being caught. She flushed, but smiled and waved.

He smiled back, and she couldn't tell if the smile was real – he was across the room – but he waved as well, a small motion, more of a fluttering of the fingers, and then he turned back to his discussion.

Ginny smiled, pleased to have some contact with her brother. She looked back to Draco and noticed the amusement in his eyes.

"So," she said, to change the subject, "how long do you think you'll have to wait before the case is reopened?"

"Depends," said Draco. "The investigation should be quick, because Tierney hasn't been in office that long, so not past a week I'm guessing."

Ginny nodded.

"Advocate Preston is here," said Draco suddenly.

Ginny raised her eyebrows.

"Come with me," Draco commanded. He touched her hand and tugged gently. The contact made her smile, even if he did relinquish his grip not a moment later. She followed as Draco navigated through the crowd. It didn't look like anyone had been called out just yet. She wondered how long it would take.

"Advocate Preston," Draco called.

Preston was a man Ginny recognized. He was the leading prosecuting attorney in England and he wasn't afraid to take on cases that were unwinnable. For him, it wasn't about a record of wins, but bringing the guilty to justice. Even when, after trying his hardest to convict, the defendant was released, Preston was satisfied that he had done all he could in the name of justice. He was a bit of a hero for Ginny, even though she found his tireless pursuit for justice a little…well, the Tom Riddle in her scoffed. Sometimes, when people were too good, they were also a little flat personality-wise.

Preston was in the middle of a conversation, but when he saw Draco, he immediately stopped and walked over to greet him. The two shook hands.

"Mr. Malfoy," said Preston. "I haven't had the pleasure of making your acquaintance, but let me compliment your legal debut."

Draco gave a crooked smirk. "Thank you. I actually have some business to talk with you, if you have a few minutes."

"Of course," said Preston.

"I wondered if you wanted to take over my case."

Ginny glanced to Draco in surprise.

"I'm sorry. What?" asked Preston, just as shocked.

"I've made my waves," said Draco. "Proved my point. Honestly, I find court tiresome. Too many little details to worry about and the paperwork is a headache. I admire your work, as I've said before, and you're probably the only one I would trust to see this case through."

"I am flattered," said Preston. "Shocked and flattered, but to be completely honest, I haven't a clue where you are going with this case." Preston hesitated, but seemed to decide on bluntness. "Lucius Malfoy is guilty. How could you expect to win this case?"

"Of course he's guilty," said Draco. He shrugged again, that shrug that said he didn't care. Ginny could see the storm in his eyes though. He did care.

"I'm not out to prove his innocence," Draco continued, "just that he was wrongly accused and wrongly convicted. Bellatrix Lestrange's testimony should not have been allowed in court."

Preston was intrigued. He stepped forward, eyebrows furrowed. Draco explained further.

"In times of war, an enemy's testimony can be admitted, but because Tierney was in on the attack, this wasn't a war, it was a coup d'état. Therefore, her testimony is inadmissible and struck from the record. Lucius Malfoy was convicted solely on her witness."

Preston stared at Draco and then laughed. "Incredible," he said. "Are you sure you don't wish to go into law. Your concept of the word 'technicality' is astounding."

Draco shook his head. "Like I said, too many details, too much paperwork."

Ginny knew it was more than that though. Draco grew bored easily. He could solve the world's biggest problems, but once he understood the solution, once he created the potion or translated runes or wrote a symphony, the thrill was gone. He didn't want to take the time to explain it, or share it, with the world. He left that tedious task to other people.

"And after you've done all the work to get to this point," said Preston, "you're willing to simply hand over the case?"

"I have two conditions," said Draco.

"You have me at a disadvantage," said Preston. "I'd do mostly anything for this case."

"I assure you, nothing drastic," said Draco. "Firstly, I'd like you to take my associate Ginevra Weasley on the case. As an intern, or paralegal, or whatever you see fit, but she's done an amazing job for me, helping me organize the case files and preparing for the examinations. She has an extensive knowledge of law and court procedure."

Ginny blushed, just a little.

"I'm sure she'll be an asset to our team," said Preston, turning to Ginny and smiling. "Planning on a career in court then?"

"Yes," said Ginny, nodding vigorously.

"We have a few summer positions available for students who are interested in the law. After this case, perhaps you would still be interested in applying?"

"I'm sure I will be," said Ginny, unable to stop the smile that grew across her face. She'd been worried that Draco dropping the case would mean she would have to let it go as well, but leave it to her boyfriend to have already considered that.

"And secondly?" asked Preston.

"My father is buried at Azkaban," said Draco, surprising Ginny by saying 'father'. She'd thought he would distance himself from Lucius. Apparently Draco had other ideas.

"You demand what reparations you see fit," he said, "but I want his body. I don't want him to stay there."

Preston nodded. "Of course."

Draco gave a polite smile. "Thank you for accepting."

"Thank you," said Preston, reaching out to shake Draco's hand once more. He then shook Ginny's. She was sure to provide a firm handclasp.

"I look forward to working with you in the future," said Preston.

"Thank you," Ginny responded.

Draco walked back to the prosecutor's table. Ginny gave her parents a wave and followed him, despite the fact that her family gestured for her to join them.

"Thanks," said Ginny, when she reclaimed her seat.

Draco arched his brow in question.

"For letting me stay with the case," she elaborated.

Draco shrugged away her gratitude.

"How long do you think we'll be stuck here?" she asked.

"Not too long," said Draco. "They'll take Whitman first, then the cabinet. Then it should be us, because we were the prosecutors. After that, they'll go by rank. Cafferty and his team will be last because they'll have the longest interrogation time. They might get charged with aiding an enemy of the state."

"Do you think they knew?"

"About Tierney and the Dementors? No. They were just after the Minister's favor."

"But they'll still get charged?"

"Yes. It's one of the perils of being a professional lackey."

Ginny laughed.

"You know," said Draco suddenly, "we'll probably get out hours before your family is dismissed."

"Hours," Ginny mused. She batted her lashes at her boyfriend. "Why, Mr. Malfoy, whatever are you proposing?"

She saw the twitch of his lips, which meant if he were anyone else, he would be smiling. Ginny liked the small softening of his mouth though. It made him look almost angelic.

"Well, I do have hundreds of galleons to blow through."

"Only hundreds?"

"Millions," he amended. "Hundreds of millions."

"You know, I've never seen Paris," said Ginny. She was feeling adventurous and he did have a ridiculous amount of money. "Can we get there and back in a couple of hours?"

Draco leaned in, and this time his lips stretched further. "With hundreds of millions of galleons, we could get there in a matter of seconds, dine at the finest restaurants, catch a matinee, and be back without anyone suspecting a thing. What do you say, Miss Weasley?"

"Yes," said Ginny. "I say, 'yes'."

And then Draco's lips turned up and parted to reveal his perfectly white, perfectly straight teeth. It was the first open smile she had ever seen on him and the effect was staggering. His eyes shone silver, his snow complexion seemed to glow. If he looked angelic before, he was Adonis now, but yet not unreachable or unattainable. That was probably because, on one side of his mouth, adding in a boyish, innocent element was –

"Oh my goodness," Ginny exclaimed delightedly. "You have a dimple!"

oOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOo

Hi. Again, sorry about the wait. The good news is, I graduate from college! And I'm going to grad school! As an apology, I'll have the next chapter up in a week. Hear that? One week. Yay!





30. Choosing a Minister

Disclaimer: Nope. Not mine. Sometimes, when the clock reads 11:11, I make a little silly wish that they were. It obviously hasn't come true yet.

Author's note: Yeah, yeah. An hour late….my bad.

oOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOo

Draco woke up in his room. His room.

For a moment he simply stared at the ceiling, the high, painted, ornate ceiling. He breathed in and rolled over onto his side to glance at the clock. He could have rolled over three times and still not rolled out of bed.

The pearl face on the large mahogany clock was lit by the moonlight spilling through the open glass doors. It was not yet five o'clock. The predawn breeze was soft with a slight chill. It made him pause under the covers and contemplate closing his eyes and trying to fall back to sleep. He wouldn't be able to, he didn't have that ability to simply turn over and drift back into sleep, but he was comfortable, relaxed. The trial had gone according to plan yesterday, and then he and Ginny had taken off for Paris. It had been an enjoyable afternoon, one he remembered in perfect detail. He had enjoyed himself. She made him…happy. It wasn't an emotion he was used to.

Draco stretched and then kicked off the covers the way one did when completely accustomed to a thousand thread Egyptian cotton. He crossed over to his wardrobe, his bare feet sinking into plush Oriental carpet, and quickly dressed in the first clothes his hands closed on, gray trousers and a white silk shirt. He left his room and walked silently down the hall. It was unnecessary to be so quiet, the rest of the Order was housed in the guest wing, but old habits returned too easily.

He left through the back door on the East wing and walked through the perfectly trimmed grass, dew soaking his feet and the hem of his trousers. He shivered once, and immediately the breeze rose a few degrees, until it was a warm caress, countering the cool dew. He hadn't realized how attuned the weather charms were to the master of the estate.

He walked past the labyrinth constructed of large hedges, and past the large marble fountain that also doubled as a swimming pool. He walked to a large oak tree, on the outskirts of the yard, nearer the woods than the house. The wooden swing Lukas had constructed was still hanging from the nearest branch, fifteen feet up. Draco remembered watching his half-brother magic the ropes up to the branch and knot themselves. He'd then picked Draco up and set him on the wood plank. It was a simple toy, almost crude for a boy who lived in a silk and silver nursery, but it was his favorite plaything. Lucius had never taken it down.

Draco sat on the swing now and pushed himself back. With a few strong pumps, he was swinging high, the wind pulling through his hair and clothes. The moon was beginning her descent, but was still beaming strongly. Pale light glistened on the dewy lawn and reflected off of his hair. In the east, the sky faded from black to dark blue.

Movement caught his attention. At first, all he could make out was a shadow, detaching from the woods, running low to the ground, indistinguishable from the distance. Draco dragged his feet in the grass to slow. The shadow changed direction to move towards him. It was an animal, black as the night. Draco stopped completely. The animal abruptly folded over on itself and stretched higher. Now it was human.

"Can't sleep?" the figure asked. It was Sirius.

Draco shrugged. "I was asleep, but I woke up."

Sirius grinned and walked closer. "Me too. You get that from your mother's side, you know. Black's have never needed a lot of sleep. They say somewhere back generations there's a vampire in the lines."

Sirius settled himself leaning against the oak. Draco pushed the swing back and swung lightly, letting his feet skim the damp grass. He waited and Sirius finally spoke.

"I asked Sam if she wanted to come back."

Draco didn't respond.

"She said she'd talk about it with you."

"I got the letter last night," said Draco.

Sirius waited.

"I didn't know that your relationship had progressed so far," said Draco.

"You make it sound like we're getting married," said Sirius. "We're not even dating, not exactly. Just…staying in contact."

There was another pause.

"What did you tell her?" Sirius asked.

"What do you think?" Draco responded neutrally.

"I think it shouldn't matter what you told her. She's a grown woman."

"She's a Muggle."

"That doesn't mean she's incapable of making her own decisions."

"It does when it relates to the magical world. She doesn't know the danger and I do."

"She can be protected."

"And what? Stay here for a year? Two years? Five years? Who knows how long the conflict will last. She'd be stuck here. Not be able to leave for fear of getting killed."

"She doesn't have to stay here. We can give her protection without putting her under house arrest."

"When the war starts in earnest, we wouldn't be able to afford that protection."

"The war might not even be a war. Harry could kill Voldemort next week for all we know."

"Are you willing to risk her life on that?" asked Draco. "She'd be a target, you know that. I know that. Lucius knew that."

"Lucius?" asked Sirius.

Draco stopped the swing and looked over.

"She was threatened. Do you think the Dar – Voldermort is that considerate?"

"You mean Lucius destroyed their house?"

"It was a warning."

"Hell of a warning."

Draco shrugged. "It worked. The point was made."

"Lucius warned them," said Sirius, sounding disbelieving, but Draco knew it had been Lucius.

"Blood is thicker than magic," he said simply.

"Lucius was a Pureblood believer."

"No. He was a believer in the old traditions. The two just coincided."

Sirius was silent for a moment, staring up at the sky.

"Don't you want them back?" he asked finally.

"I knew them half a year, not even that."

"Isn't blood thicker than time?"

"That metaphor makes no sense," said Draco, but he knew what Sirius meant. It confused him, this concept of family. As if he should be closer to his family, after knowing them for five months, than with, say, Blaise.

"You must miss them," Sirius prodded.

Draco sighed. "Certain moments, I wish they were here. But I don't relate well with them. They're very…stressful to have around. I'm not keeping them away simply because I don't like them. I have to consider what is best for them, and while, yes, it's easier to do that because I'm not entirely close with them, I do…I regret not being able to know them further. It would be nice to have people first concerned about me."

"You don't think we're concerned about you?"

"I think that you already have family you belong to first, and everyone else comes second. I think I would like to be first, someday."

"Did Lucius-?"

"No. First the family name, second the business, thirdly him, but I think sometimes I tied for third."

"What about you? Who's first?"

Draco snorted. "Me, obviously."

"Really?" Sirius seemed genuinely surprised. "It seems to me you're not always acting in your best interests. I mean, getting recaptured by Voldemort and pulling me out of the Veil? I hear that didn't turn out so well for you."

"But I wanted to do those things, to promote my own agenda." Draco gave Sirius a sidelong look. "You know," he said, "I'm not stopping you from visiting Sam. I'm not thrilled with the idea, but I'm not stopping you."

Sirius shook his head. "I don't think I could leave."

"Because Harry's number one for you," said Draco. "Motivated largely by guilt, of course, at least in the beginning."

Sirius shot him a look. Draco shrugged.

"You know everything, kid?"

"No. Just a lot."

Sirius chuckled. "Alright. What about Bill? Who's his number one?"

"Not me, if that's what you're thinking," said Draco. "His switches. He's got a lot of people close to him and who depend on him. Sometimes, I'm his primary concern, but then he feels guilty about Fleur and Lukas. And then when he's thinking about them, he feels guilty for not worrying about me. It's a common thread with you people. Guilt. You, Bill, Dumbledore. You should get that looked at."

"You're hilarious," said Sirius.

Draco shrugged. "I try."

The sky was paling further in the eastern corner. Draco stood.

"Breakfast is at eight," he said. "Dumbledore wants to talk."

Sirius followed him in.

Draco went back to his room to shower and change. It was still too early by the time he was dressed for the day, and so he stopped by his office. Malfoy Inc. didn't come with a lot of work for Draco to do. He trusted the executives Lucius had appointed to tend to the menial tasks. It was a good thing he wasn't swamped with paperwork as well. With Tierney gone, once again the Ministry was in need of a Minister.

This time, there would be no public debates. The vote would not be given to the wizards and witches of England. There had been a coup - well, not really because Tierney wasn't exactly a Death Eater, but he would be found guilty of consorting with Voldemort, and that would be enough – and after such, it was up to the Wizengamot to vote in a Minister. That didn't mean Draco didn't get a say. He could throw his support behind a nominee of his choice. The nominees came from the Board of District Officials, and Draco had a few connections there, as did Dumbledore. He just hoped he and Dumbledore were on the same page this time.

Draco knew who he wanted to nominate for Minister. All he had to do was convince the rest. Last time, he had taken the direct approach, and it hadn't worked. He would have to be a little more subtle this time. And reinforcements wouldn't hurt. He sent an owl to Pansy and Blaise, inviting them to breakfast.

Ginny found him in his study. She knocked on the open door to get his attention.

"Getting an early start?" she asked.

"I thought it'd be prudent," said Draco.

She walked over to perch on the desk. "Should I expect a display of fireworks over breakfast?" she asked.

"I hope not," said Draco. "But then again, it is politics."

"And before coffee," said Ginny.

"I'm sure Dumbledore will wait for coffee at least. He is reputed to be wise."

Ginny laughed and they walked out of the office together.

"So, any ideas for Minister?" Ginny asked. "It's only fair you put one in after taking one out."

"I have an idea," Draco allowed.

"Feel like sharing?"

"I was going for the surprise factor."

"I could act surprised," said Ginny. She made the appropriate 'shocked' face, hands clasped at her heart.

He smirked, she smiled, he paused and pulled her in for a quick kiss before they reached the dining room.

Draco felt good. Since the moment he had woken up, it was like the sun had broken through clouds after a week of rain. Lucius was dead, yes, but Draco had won his revenge against Tierney. He would have his revenge against Voldemort too, he knew he would, but right now, he was content to wait. He had his home again, and he was surround by people who, even if he wasn't their first consideration, still looked after him. And Ginny was standing before him, her hair brushed straight and smooth, falling against her cheek, and he reached out to brush the strands back. His fingertips skimmed against her soft skin, so soft he could spend eternity with just that contact, and that one, brief brush wasn't enough, so his thumb caressed her cheekbone once his fingers had passed.

His eyes followed his thumb's path. He took in every detail of her cheek, the light complexion, the gentle contour, the light smattering of freckles. His gaze drifted up from her cheek to her eyes, beautiful, shining topaz.

Draco suddenly wondered if she was the charm that had brought all his luck to him, if she was the cause for everything good thing in his life. He had never deserved such blessings; it must be because of her. But why was she here, standing before him, with such a light in her eyes, with that small, gentle smile on her lips?

He realized he was staring too long when her brow furrowed. Some of his bewilderment must have showed on his face, but he could only watch as her head tilted to the side, her hair falling in a wave with the motion.

"What?" she asked with a smile.

Draco tried to shrug, tried to say 'nothing' and move on, but the words didn't come and his body didn't respond. He stared helplessly at her, trying to understand, his mind stuck on the mystery that was Ginevra Weasley.

Ginny stepped closer, her hand reaching out to brush his cheek.

"You look like you're trying to solve the mystery of life," she said. "Don't you have enough to worry about?"

Her eyes darkened a shade, concerned for him. He hadn't meant to worry her and that was enough to spur him into action. He took a quick step back, disengaging. He forced serenity onto his face.

"You can find most of the constellations in your freckles," he said.

She blinked, startled by his comment.

"You were memorizing my freckles?" she asked.

"I have a perfect memory."

"Could you remember me without them?"

Now Draco was startled. "Without your freckles?" he asked. "Why?"

She shrugged. "Never been a fan, really."

"No," said Draco, frowning. He was surprised to find that he was genuinely upset that she didn't like her freckles. He found them exceedingly attractive. She wouldn't be his Ginny without the freckles.

She shrugged again. Draco reached out and traced a finger over her cheek.

"I like them," he promised.

She blushed, just a little. "Well, I'm glad one of us does," she said. "Come on, I'm starving."

"You go ahead," said Draco. "I might have to Floo over to Blaise's because I don't know if their up to get my owl."

"You called for reinforcements?" Ginny asked, correctly guessing his reasons.

"I figured it couldn't hurt," said Draco.

She laughed and then started for the kitchen. Draco watched her go, wondering again how he had arrived her, at this moment, with her. He didn't understand at all, and that should drive him insane, because if it was one thing he needed, it was answers, but when he looked at her, he suddenly didn't mind confusion.

"I saw the way you looked at her."

Draco whirled around, face going blank and his hand reaching for his wand. He was thoroughly startled, and when he saw Mr. Weasley, standing halfway down the hallway, he became thoroughly flustered. He wondered how long Ginny's father had been standing there. Was he talking about gazing after Ginny, or did he see Draco staring at his daughter like an idiot? Either way, it wasn't good.

Mr. Weasley walked down the hallway to stop in front of Draco. Draco barely resisted the urge to step backwards. Ginny was very much a daddy's girl.

"I believed you were smart when you said you were," said Mr. Weasley. "But now I know you can use that head of yours for more than just potions and politics."

"Sir?" asked Draco, thoroughly confused.

"You were looking at her like she was the most amazing thing you have ever seen. Father's like to know that their daughters are recognized as precious and irreplaceable. Because that's exactly what she is."

Draco frowned. He had no idea what Mr. Weasley was saying.

"I would never do anything to hurt her," he started, hoping that was what Mr. Weasley was looking for. He had already promised, but Ginny's father must be trying to get at something and Draco was quite ready to spout out oaths if it meant escaping Mr. Weasley.

Mr. Weasley gave the lightest of chuckles and stepped forward again. He clasped Draco's shoulder and Draco nearly bolted, but Mr. Weasley tightened his grip, not hard, just firmly.

"Hold on there," he said. "I'm not going to start yelling. I'm trying to…well, I'm trying to thank you, I guess."

"But I haven't-,"

"You have," said Mr. Weasley. "I'm her father. I would know."

He patted Draco's shoulder, gave him a half-sad smile, and moved towards the dining room.

"Mr. Weasley," Draco called. The man turned and Draco didn't bother to hide the confusion on his face. "The next time you feel like emoting to me, do you think you could wait until after breakfast, when I might have a better chance at understanding you?"

Mr. Weasley gave a startled laugh. "I'll do my best."

Draco shook his head as the Weasley patriarch turned a corner and passed out of sight. What, in the name of Merlin, had just happened?

A soft pop sounded by his side, and Draco looked down to see Tolly appear.

"Master Blaise Zabini has arrived with Miss Pansy Parkinson. Shall I see them to the dining room?"

"Yes, please," said Draco. And then he headed to the dining room himself.

oOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOo

Once again, Charlie was lured to an Order meeting under the pretense of food. And while there was food, and it was really good food, that didn't mean he enjoyed sitting through the political agenda of the Order. He didn't understand or like politics. He preferred the tangible. Like the feel of a leather harness in his hand, the strain of his arms and he and ten other men tried to ground a dragon, the feel of the wind on his face when he grabbed hold of tough scales and took a quick ride before being tossed off. He didn't think that made him stupid, just different. He preferred the simple things in life. Like the hourglass shape of a beautiful woman.

Charlie glanced across the table at Pansy. The dark-haired girl had one elbow resting on the table, her hand idling twirling her long, sleek ponytail while her other hand turned her water glass around and around. For all her appearance of disinterest, she was glancing towards the debaters frequently.

"We need a Minister who will recognize the truth to our current struggle," said Albus. He was mainly looking at Draco when he said that.

"We also need a Minister who won't further the tear in the country," Draco countered. "We should either look for a Pureblood candidate, or a Half-blood or Muggle born who is affluent in the business sphere."

Draco, like Pansy, appeared eminently unconcerned with the topic, even though he was arguing against the combined forces of Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, and Arthur. Charlie could see that his father was growing frustrated at Draco's attitude. The Slytherin wasn't fiddling, like Pansy, but he was lazily rolling his head from Dumbledore to Arthur as they spoke, and occasionally rolling his eyes, and while his posture was correct, his hands often waved in dismissal of a point.

It was funny, actually. Charlie didn't know if anyone else picked up on it, but he was a dragon-trainer so the thought occurred to him. He was seeing Pansy and Draco in their real habitat. This was their natural environment, surrounded by the near blinding twinkle of diamond chandeliers and jeweled candelabra, enveloped in silk and satin, and besieged by armies of elves, all willing to whisk away even the slightest of irritants.

This is what an insane amount of money does to children, he thought. Money and parents who were once children with insane amounts of money.

"We can't pander to the populace," said Arthur. "We need a Minister capable of taking a stand."

"It won't be much of a stand if the country isn't behind him," said Draco, a note of derision in his voice. "The Minister is only as powerful as the citizens who support him. And that's another point as well, we need a Minister who has wealthy supporters."

"If the Minister has the approval of the people, he won't need to be wealthy," said Albus.

"If this does develop into war, the country won't be able to back all of the expenses," said Draco. "Wars bankrupt countries. If the country has to take loans, it should be from its citizens, not other countries."

"How many more conditions do you have?" Arthur demanded. "You've already discarded the entire country. He has to be a wealthy man. A strong man. A man who everyone likes. What's next? A man who can dance the Fire Waltz?"

"Well, it could be a woman," said Pansy, speaking up for the first time. She shrugged as the table looked her way. "I'm just saying. And I think you're all forgetting something rather important. The public isn't going to elect this Minister. The Wizengamot will decide because of the coup. Therefore, your job is actually quite simple. You need to cater to the Wizengamot. And, if you are concerned about support, simply get the Ministry elected by a vast majority. The country's approval will follow."

"The public's approval of the government is down," said Sirius. "How will a majority help?"

"Approval ratings are down because the Minister turned out to be a Death Eater, but who elected him into office? The public. Now, no one will admit to voting for Tierney, but they will blame everyone else, and so they mistrust their neighbors and countrymen. A strong support of a candidate by the Wizengamot will do a lot to ease fear and put trust back into the Minister."

Charlie could tell she had just impressed everyone at the table. Everyone except Draco, who looked as if he had wanted Pansy to point that out. The blond toasted her with his coffee mug and then took a sip.

"Pansy," he said, setting the coffee back down, "you've slept with a third of the Wizengamot, any insights you want to share?"

"Hardly a third," said Pansy. "Most of them all old, but if we include relatives, I've got insights on nearly a half."

Charlie didn't like her blasé shrug at Draco's words. She even had a semi-wicked smile on her face when she boasted of her ties to the court. It wasn't that he thought less of her, or was angry at her boast – not that he had a right to be angry, because she wasn't with him or anything, and not that he even wanted her to be with him, that is, she was a pretty girl, and there was an attraction on his part, but that really was it – but he hated how she must have gotten her start. Even in this modern age, sons were still more celebrated than daughters. Especially when the family only had one heir.

Pansy had no siblings. No doubt her parents had lamented her gender and took a small solace in their daughter's incredible beauty. For women in the Pureblood traditions, much of their power was in their appearance and sexual prowess.

Charlie suddenly glanced to his sister. She was getting serious with Draco. Would that lead to marriage? He couldn't see his sister becoming a trophy wife, but then again, maybe she was what the Pureblood women needed. A shock to the system. If she did end up marrying Draco – oh Merlin, he did not know how he felt about that – the Malfoy name would only bolster her standing. She could get away with a lot, and even held as a standard.

Disturbed by thoughts of his younger sister marrying, Charlie forced himself back to the breakfast conversation.

"Ellis is a key player," said Pansy. "He could get a fourth of the Wizengamot easily."

Charlie had no idea who Ellis was, nor did he really care to be completely honest. He sighed and sipped his tea, and then occupied himself by watching Pansy school the table in politics. Watching, not listening.

Her hands moved attractively as she spoke, twisting and gesturing, sometimes nearly fluttering. When she moved her head, her hair rippled out from the tie it was held in. Several different shades were visible, midnight black, espresso brown, and deep mahogany red. Her hair continued to sway long after her head stilled. It was hypnotizing to watch. Her lips –

Charlie jerked when a foot connected with his leg. He looked over to see Ron across from him, a 'what the hell are you doing?' expression on his face.

'What?' Charlie mouthed innocently.

'You were staring,' Ron mouthed back, then pantomimed Charlie gazing at Pansy with wide-eyes and a love-sick expression.

Charlie kicked him back, satisfied at the stifled yelp from his younger brother. It showed how intent the discussion was that no one looked over.

"For the last time," Draco was saying, his voice exasperated, "I will not support Hastings. He's completely inexperienced."

"Inexperienced?" Remus asked. "He's been a governor for two terms now."

"Yes, exactly my point. He's been governor of a miniscule, unimportant –,"

And Charlie tuned the lot of them out again. For a while, he watched Blaise's attempts to build a fruit tower on his plate. It would have worked better if he didn't use the pineapple wedges as a base. They were entirely too juicy to be stable enough to support the apple slices.

Tonks was watching too. She was sitting between Kingsley and Remus, and even though neither of the men spoke up very often, they were still involved enough to isolate her from the end of the table that wasn't paying attention. She looked like she wanted to help build the fruit tower. Charlie caught her eyes and sighed sympathetically. She sighed back and slouched lower in her seat.

"Then who the hell is left?" Charlie's dad demanded in frustration.

Charlie immediately sat up straighter and looked over. The attention that particular tone of voice demanded was an ingrained response.

"Well, we could just nominate you Draco. That'd resolve most of your objections, wouldn't it?" asked Sirius.

Was that what Draco had been aiming for? Charlie looked at the blond and nearly laughed at the look of revulsion on the Slytherin's face.

"First off," said Draco, "I do not meet the criteria I set out, or were you now paying attention?"

"I stopped listening after the thirtieth," said Sirius.

"Secondly, I do not want to be Minister. It'd be boring. I'd go insane."

Charlie didn't doubt that. Some people were just too smart to want to go into politics.

"And thirdly, I doubt you'd actually vote for me."

"I wouldn't vote for you," said Ginny, right beside Draco. "You're entirely too good-looking. I don't trust hot politicians."

There was an awkward silence after her statement because most of the table was composed of her family and like Charlie, none of them wanted to think about her considering anyone 'hot'.

"Is there anyone left to nominate?" Tonks asked in desperation. She obviously wanted the meeting to be over.

"I still think Hastings," said Dumbledore.

"If I got a vote, I'd vote for Denton," said Sirius.

"Kingsley," said Draco. "You took political science classes at the Academy. What about you?"

The large Auror looked up from his coffee in surprise. "Me?" he asked, taken off-guard at the attention. "Well, I was thinking about Patters, Mark Patters. He's relatively new, but I think he has a good head on his shoulders."

"Patters," mused Dumbledore. "I hadn't thought about him."

"No," said Draco to Kingsley. "I wasn't asking your opinion, I was asking about you."

"About me what?" asked Kingsley.

"If you wanted to be Minister," said Draco.

oOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOoOo—oOoOoOoOoOoOo

Yeah, I know. Nothing much happened here. And it's kinda short. Still, the action will pick up next chapter…and that is 'pick up', not code for broom chases, an army of Boggarts, Draco confronting Dumbledore, a kidnapping, or a surprise visit from….well, those will all come later on in the story. And not too much later on. This story does need to end sometime. Also…I didn't proofread too much…sorry for bad grammer, speling.

Also, I'll try for a week update, but this one might take two...especially if I want it to be the usual legnth.





31. Election Hazards

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. But I am watching it tonight at 12:06. We got tickets a little late, not cool enough for 12:01 I guess.

Author's note: Hi, for those who have read my profile, you know that I recently moved. To another state in fact, how fantastic! Well, I'm still in the middle of moving, so that's why the delay of chapter. In other news, my apartment is lovely! The price, not so much…ah well, such is the penalty for growing older.

oOoOoOoOoOo~oOoOoOoOoOo~oOoOoOoOoOo

"Look out!" someone screamed. A second later, a curse was flung at the podium.

Draco had actually spotted the danger five seconds before the warning. That had given him enough time to do several things.

One: he reached for his wand.

Two: he remembered that he was in the Ministry and so had surrendered his wand at the front desk as per the security requirements.

Three: he tapped the shoulder of the Auror closest to him (while kicking himself for not bringing his unregistered wand) and alerted him to the danger.

Four: he kept track of the man steadily moving towards the podium and scanned the crowd, looking for any more people who might be in on the attack. He spotted two.

Five: he really, really wished he had just brought his unregistered wand with him, even if using it would destroy the image of the law-abiding citizen he was trying to project.

It wasn't a large gathering in the Ministry Atrium. Most of the wizards and witches present were reporters, broadcasting to a larger audience at home. Those who weren't reporters were Ministry officials or the campaign managers and sponsors of the candidates. Still, it was crowded right by the platform. Draco had been standing on the perimeter of the group, which was why he noticed the man.

The Aurors were moving into position when the man bumped into a secretary of some sort, and she noticed the man's hand tucked suspiciously into his jacket, the head ducked low and the grim set of the man's face. That was when she screamed and the attack started.

The curse that started the chaos was a very basic explosion spell. It toppled the podium and a few of the candidates and started a small fire. Draco could tell from the opening attack that the men involved in this onslaught were not Death Eaters, but probably sympathizers, hired with the promise of a mountain of gold. Draco doubted these men would ever see it. It would be better for Voldemort that they would be captured and proclaim his coming. Better to strike fear in the citizens of England.

It was a risky move for Voldemort. Kingsley was the candidate that offered the greatest sense of security, as he was an Auror. If the attacks continued, Kingsley would be voted in from sheer panic. Voldemort must be confidant that he could remove Kingsley from the picture.

Draco ducked as the attack became a small battle. The other two men had begun flinging spells as well and the Aurors were hindered by the crowded room of civilians. Most had the sense to drop to the floor, but the rest were panicking and trying to run.

The line of fireplaces in the Atrium flared green as the Aurors called for support. Red-robed figures ran out, some joining the fight, others trying to get the civilians to safety. The skirmish should have been over sooner than this, but Draco could tell that the attackers had been given some form of a strengthening potion. They shook off subduing spells and broke through magical bindings. It would take a direct and powerful spell to incapacitate them.

To the right, two Aurors opened the double doors leading to a service hallway and began hustling civilians out of harm's way. Draco was ushered over as well and he joined he rattled politicians and reporters in the hall. A few were injured, but no one appeared to be in any mortal danger. The Aurors shut the door from the outside when most of the audience had made it to relative safety.

Draco moved away from the doors, wanting to get away from the worst of the crowd. He leaned against the wall, on high alert, feeling incredibly vulnerable without his wand. He tried to keep tabs on the other temporary refugees but it was impossible to keep track of everyone in the hall. He wasn't aware of the woman moving towards him until her blonde hair glinted in the strong ceiling lights. He started, silently cursed, and then affected a casual air.

"Claire," he said, as if greeting an old acquaintance.

"Draco," she responded in like manner. Her smile, though, was smugly triumphantly.

Draco stepped away from the wall and towards Claire. So this had been Voldemort's plan. Not to take out Kingsley, but to remove his support. Draco should have seen this coming; it was basic strategy. Go for the unprotected support, not the carefully guarded king. The scheme hadn't occurred to him because he hadn't considered himself the unprotected support. He'd always been able to take care of any threat.

"Here to kill me?" he asked, spreading his arms from his sides to show he was unarmed.

"Unfortunately, yes," said Claire.

Draco faced her in the middle of the hall. He looked beyond her, to the crowd, but no one noticed, and why should they? Claire was dressed in a plain tweed suit. She blended. She hadn't a drawn a wand yet, though Draco knew she must have one. Right now, they could have been business associates. Even when she started casting, Draco doubted anyone would intervene on his behalf. They were too rattled, too frightened.

"I had hoped that this would be more sporting," Claire continued. "It seems so anticlimactic, to end this here and now. You, defenseless against me."

"You could always give me a wand," said Draco. "I'd hate to disappoint."

She smiled. "I'm sure the satisfaction of watching you breathe your last will be worth the small amount of disappointment for not besting you in a duel."

She reached into her jacket and casually pulled out her wand. Draco steeled himself. All he had to do was stall for time before someone alerted the Aurors, but with the already-frightened crowd, such clear thinking might take a while.

Claire flicked her wand. The speed of the spell belied her nonchalant casting. It flew at Draco, narrow, blue and deadly. The spell never hit. Draco threw up his right hand and the signet ring he wore on his first finger pulsed. The spell was forced aside, hitting the wall with a blast. The wall cracked and splintered. A few pieces were sent into the air. Someone at the front of the hall screamed.

Draco dove to the right. Claire had been surprised at his defense, but she recovered quickly, sending out another spell. She shouldn't have been surprised. Like he would really allow himself to be entirely defenseless.

This second spell of Claire's hit the ground and harmlessly fizzled out. The third brushed through his hair as he dropped to the floor. He redirected one more spell and jumped to his feet. She sent out two in quick succession. He twisted by one, but the other caught him on his shoulder. He was thrown back with the force. He hit the floor on his side and skidded a few feet on the polished marble.

He immediately rolled over onto his back, his eyes on Claire as his feet scrabbled to get himself upright again. His hand was pressed tight over his right shoulder, and the injury was hot to the touch and slick with blood. The pain was an afterthought, pushed to the side of his consciousness by adrenaline and the will to survive.

"Clever with the ring," said Claire, walking towards him, wand leveled at his chest. "But, in the end, futile."

She jerked her wand and Draco was flung into the wall. His cheek connected with wood paneling. He heard a crack, but wasn't sure if it was his skull or the boards. He crumpled to the floor.

The world was spinning and flashing. There was something else he needed to remember. He didn't expect to die here when he first faced Claire; he always had contingency plans, but everything was muddled, except the pain in his head which was a very tangible fire.

He felt hands on his chest, gripping his robe, pulling his head up. He forced his eyes to stay trained on the vague oval of apricot in front of him and slowly, very slowly, Claire's face came into focus. He stared into blue eyes.

"I might miss you," Claire offered, as if that was consolation.

Like his vision, he forced the fog away in his mind. Thinking used to be so easy. He blinked, tried to sit up, but groaned, and curled up around the pain in his shoulder. His hand dropped to his boot.

"Good-bye, Draco," Claire said, and raised her wand.

Draco lunged forward. He knew he would only get this one chance, and he knew his attack would be clumsy at best, so he put his whole weight behind it. He knocked into her, sending her backwards, and plunged the knife into her side.

He landed half on top of her and felt, rather than heard, her gasp. Draco pushed himself up and away, just in case she had her own knife on her person. Claire was hissing in air and trying to sit up. Her wand rolled from her fingers and Draco tried to reach it. He only managed to knock it towards the opposite wall.

Draco pushed himself to his feet and stumbled over to retrieve the wand. His head didn't agree with the motion so he slumped against the wall and slid back down to the floor.

Claire pulled the knife out of her side and gripped it in a bloody hand. She forced herself to her knees, murder in her eyes. Draco managed to grab Claire's wand and raise his arm to point the wand at her.

As it turned out, it wasn't necessary. Claire's face was rapidly paling and she looked down at her side. Scarlet blood was pumping out in spurts. An arterial bleed.

"You shouldn't have pulled the knife out," said Draco. "It was blocking the blood."

Claire opened her mouth, her voice fading but still indignant, accusing. "You…you bloody stabbed me!"

"I can't believe you fell for that," Draco said. His own voice was slightly breathy. "A knife in the boot? It's the oldest trick in the book."

She snarled at him, like a cat tossed into a bath, but then there were people stepping closer, and loud voices, and bright, blinding red robes. It was almost a pity the Aurors response time was so good. Claire would have died if they came just ten seconds later.

Three hours later, and Draco was sitting in St. Mungo's waiting room. The Healer wouldn't let him leave without supervision so he had sent for Bill. He hadn't sent for anyone until then, or even informed them that he'd been attacked, so it was understandable that Bill was a little anxious when he arrived. Understandable, but still a little annoying.

"Merlin, Draco, what happened?" were the first words out of Bill's mouth.

"I did tell you in the owl," said Draco. He pushed himself to his feet, feeling the ache that the Healer promised him would take a day or more to fade.

Bill offered a hand, but Draco waved him back. The dizziness had been cured by the bruise-be-gone used on the side of his face. The ointment, however, hadn't been able to erase all of the bruises. He had a lovely blue and green array over his entire left temple and cheek.

"Claire?" Bill asked.

"She'll live. Unfortunately," said Draco blandly.

"But she'll be sent to Azkaban."

"And Voldemort will get her out."

His head throbbed and Draco reached up to rub his temple, forgetting about the bruise. His fingers hit the still-tender skin and he hissed in a quick breath.

"You sure you're okay?" asked Bill.

"Yeah."

"Are you sure you should be leaving?"

"They'd just have me in bed here. I can do that at home."

Draco stepped over to the receptionist's desk. "Can you tell Healer Lawrence that my friend arrived?"

"Of course," she responded.

Draco turned back to Bill who was frowning.

"I should have gone with you," he said.

"Yeah, you definitely should have been there. You missed out on a great time," said Draco, rolling his eyes. That actually disoriented him a little bit so he locked his knees and waited for the moment to pass.

"You know what I mean," said Bill. "You didn't have anyone to look out for you."

"Bill," said Draco. "You wouldn't have had your wand either. I'm actually very happy that no one was there with me. Another person would have meant more for Claire to work with and more distractions for me. I barely got myself out alive."

"That other person could have helped," said Bill. "You don't have to do all the rescuing you know."

"And when Claire has her wand leveled at you and orders me to hold still so she can Avada me or she'll Avada you? How are you helping then?"

"I can look out for myself," said Bill. "I've been doing it for a while now."

Draco sighed. He knew that, he would just –

"I would feel responsible," said Draco.

"Which is exactly how I feel," said Bill.

Draco opened his mouth, saw the point Bill was making, and realized that he couldn't think of any retort.

"My head hurts," he said, nullifying any victory Bill wanted to take from the discussion. He sounded a bit more petulant than he would have liked.

"As well it should," said Healer Lawrence stepping into the waiting room. She looked to Bill. "Are you here to pick Mr. Malfoy up?"

"Yes."

"Here's a list of instructions for looking after someone with a head injury. He should be nearly fully recovered by tomorrow, but if there is any disorientation, memory lapses, slurred speech, or if unconsciousness should occur, you should bring him right back here. Sometimes our instruments don't register all of the damage, or the potions can act as a temporary, but not permanent, cure."

"Understood," said Bill.

"He shouldn't have any rich foods for the next twelve hours and if any –,"

"For Merlin's sake," Draco cut in, "I memorized that entire list while getting checked over."

Lawrence looked to him and then turned back to Bill.

"His cognitive functioning doesn't seem to be impaired," she allowed, "but the only reason we're letting him go is because he's rather adamant about leaving. The wound to his shoulder has been magically sealed. We were going to give him a sling, to make sure he doesn't tear the wound, but he was adamant about not needing that as well. You should make sure that he doesn't raise his arm any higher than his shoulder and he should lift anything today. I am going to give you an ointment that should be applied every four to six hours to keep out infection. If the wound becomes red or swollen, you should bring him back in for a further check-up. Any questions?"

"No," said Draco, "because I memorized that list as well."

Bill took the papers from Lawrence anyway. "Thank you," he said.

They shook hands and Draco sighed, loudly, his fingers tapping against his side. He'd already spent three hours in the hospital. All additional minutes were grating.

The Healer finally left and Draco turned to Bill in relief. The red-haired man was looking absurdly amused and Draco frowned.

"What?" he asked shortly.

"You," said Bill, "are such a teenager right now."

Draco blinked. "I'm a what?" he demanded, then hurried to follow Bill as the former professor headed for the elevators. "I'm a 'teenager'? I actually take offense to that."

"But you can't deny it, can you?" Bill challenged.

Draco opened his mouth and realized once more that he had no answer.

"My head hurts," he decided on.

They Flooed out from the front entrance back to the Malfoy Estate. Even in his own home, Draco couldn't escape the suffocating attention that came after fighting for his life against a Death Eater. Mrs. Weasley wasn't satisfied until she examined his pupils and had him track her finger across his field of vision (because obviously the Healers did not have more advanced medical equipment). Fred and George hounded him to hear the entire gory story (and once wasn't enough). Sirius tried to give him the secret Black recipe to cure any kind of headaches, including hangovers (a quarter way down the ingredients list he got nauseas, and he didn't think much of it had to do with his concussion). Ron offered a game of Wizard's chess, wondering how quickly he could defeat an impaired genius (Draco figured it would be a matter of twenty-five moves).

When Bill told him he should lie down for a while, Draco readily agreed. Ginny followed him up to his room and they both lay on the huge bed, staring up at the ceiling. The conversation that transpired was a little inane, as Draco found it a little harder to keep his thoughts in line, but Ginny seemed more than willing to follow his somewhat crazed stream of consciousness.

Draco went to bed early, was woken up through the night just to make sure his brain was still functioning properly, and when he finally got out of bed, at nine, he felt completely rested and ready to start out on the campaign trail again.

"No," said Bill at breakfast.

"It's just a day trip," said Draco. "To Bath. By Floo, it's roughly a two second journey."

"I wouldn't care if it was right next door," said Bill. "We're still watching you for brain damage."

"I think I would have noticed any brain damage by now," said Draco. "Besides, my face took the brunt of the impact and I wouldn't call that vital to my survival."

"It's vital to our relationship," said Ginny next to him. "Stay cute for me."

Across the table, Ron gagged.

"I'm the financial backbone for Kingsley. I should be there to show support!" Draco protested.

Bill got up, crossed to the side table, and picked up the newspapers that had been delivered that morning. He plopped them down, one by one, right in front of Draco, reading off the headlines.

"Draco Malfoy Attacked by Death Eaters at Nominations" That was the Daily Prophet, complete with a picture of him slumped against the wall.

"Death Eater Attack at Ministry; Malfoy Targeted" That was the Morning Muse, showing him and Claire battling in the hall. It was a rather nice action shot.

"You-Know-Who Wants Draco Malfoy Dead" And the Wizard Times reported it as well, with a picture of Draco getting hit by Claire's curse.

"Love Turns Deadly in the Ministry" And that was the Quibbler with a picture of Claire kneeling in the hall, the bloody knife in her hands and Draco pointing the wand at her. As always, a fine, upstanding example of wizarding journalism. Although, in an odd sort of way, the headline was not so far off. Claire would do anything for Voldemort's affection.

"I think," said Bill, "that all of England would understand you taking a day off. Let some of us help with this campaign, alright?"

Draco sighed. "A whole day?" he asked.

"A whole day," said Bill.

The whole day actually went by rather quickly. It helped that there were so many people around. He played Wizard's chess with Ron, five games, Ron won three. Draco was somewhat distracted by Fred and George rough housing by the display of antique vases. Ron was much more used to his brother's antics and didn't care about pottery. Draco also wrote up a list of spells for the Golden Trio's dueling lessons. He read a book on successful political campaigns during the Vampire Wars of 1613. He gave Ginny and Hermione his Gringotts charm so they could pick up evening gowns for the banquet he was holding the night of elections.

Harry looked at him like he was daft for simply giving them access to his back accounts, but Draco knew that most stores were only too happy to see their designs on public figures at public events. They would either get the dresses or all the accessories free. Besides, Narcissa bought hordes of clothes and jewels every week. With her extravagance written out of the budget, Draco would have to look for a new charity to sponsor to eat up the extra cash.

Draco was back on the campaign the next day, though all that consisted of was attending a political luncheon at Huntsford Lodge. He made his rounds with the Council Members and conversation flowed easily, probably because he still had the faintest of bruises on his temple.

It did not escape his notice that the usual contingent of Aurors was doubled in number, and that several were in formal attire to blend in with the guests. It also did not escape his notice that wherever he went, the Aurors were sure to pass by much more frequently.

"The muscle is unnecessary," he told Kingsley at the drink table.

The large man shrugged. "They're friends of mine," he said.

"And what? You called in a favor?"

"Just dropped a hint."

"Right," said Draco. "Care to call them off?"

"We've still got an hour," the Auror said easily.

A waiter held out a glass of wine for Draco. He took it.

"The whole running for Minister is obviously going to your head," Draco sniped. He left to find Council Member Wick.

Geoffrey Wick was a startling untalented conversationalist, and disregarded even the most obvious of openings of "So, someone tried to kill you the other day." Draco had to pry every sentence from the man, but he persisted because Wick was a brilliant politician and in favor with the northern delegates.

He was hoping to speak with Judge Ashley after, but then Percy Weasley, Acting Minister, approached.

"Mr. Malfoy," said Percy. "A word?"

"Of course," said Draco. He followed the Assistant to a quiet stretch of wall. Percy was flanked by two Aurors in black dress robes. Obviously England was taking the safety of her Ministers, even the Acting ones, quite seriously. Percy managed to send them back a few steps with a look, but they refused to retreat any further.

"Something wrong?" asked Draco.

"It depends on you," said Percy. "Shacklebolt. He's a member of the Order. The Civis Arma isn't comfortable with having the Minister be a part of a vigilante group, even one as sound as the Order."

"Because it gives one man too much power," said Draco.

"Precisely," said Percy. "For all we know, he could be using the Order to plot assassinations. You can understand our concern." Percy gestured to his own temple. Draco gave a rueful smile.

"I do understand," he said. "Dumbledore does as well. Should he become Minister-,"

"You mean when," said Percy.

"When he becomes Minister," Draco corrected with a smirk, "Kingsley will withdraw from the Order."

"Completely?" asked Percy.

"He will pass on information if it is vital to the destruction of Voldemort, no more, no less."

"And who decides if this is vital information?" asked Percy.

"He will," said Draco. "And I'm sure you'll have a say in it too. There's not much he can hide from you."

Percy shrugged in non-contest. "Thank you," he said.

"We are on the same side," Draco reminded him.

"True," said Percy.

"Is that all?"

"Not entirely. This is just from me. You remember when I mentioned freezing your assets should you sponsor the wrong candidate?"

"Yes. You have an objection?"

"Just one." Percy glanced behind him and lowered his voice. "He's an Auror, for Merlin's sake. It was bad enough cleaning up Tierney's mess, now you're giving me an untrained Minister. I'm going to have to teach him how to run the country as well as clean up his mistakes. I was hoping to get a break, not put in more overtime."

Draco smirked at the frazzled tone. "Yes, he might need a little polish, but give him a few weeks, and I guarantee that he'll get the hang of it. He took politics in the Academy, so he'll have the general idea."

"The general idea," Percy reiterated. "I have a general idea to seize half of your estate."

"Yeah, good luck with that. I transferred most of my funds out of the country, just in case you felt like retaliating." Draco gave Percy a smug smile.

Percy shook his head. "Unbelievable, Malfoy."

"You warned me," said Draco. He nodded to Percy in farewell and moved back to the main party. His arm was snagged by Council Member Haverton and he reluctantly stopped.

"So, Malfoy," Haverton said, "quite the exciting day at the nominations, I hear."

Draco gave a wan smile. "It could be termed exciting."

"Nothing like free publicity though, am I right?" asked Haverton. "Such a perfect timing for your campaign, too."

"Oh, it was," said Draco. "In fact, it was so successful, the next time I sponsor a candidate, I'm going to find another genocidal madman to try to kill me."

Haverton laughed. "We should all find ourselves such riveting dramas, eh?"

Draco stared at the man.

"And befriending Harry Potter too, now that is true genius," Haverton continued. "And the 'feud' with your father. Of course, bad move on his part for getting caught on the wrong team, but you recovered nicely."

"Yes, but just wait for the finale," said Draco.

"The finale?" asked Haverton.

"Oh yes. Explosions, hippogriffs, spies and traitors, all fantastic stuff. You should be there."

"I hope to be," said Haverton. "When will it be held?"

"Now Council Member," said Draco reprovingly, "that would be telling."

Haverton laughed delightedly. Draco restrained himself from pulling out his wand. Instead he raised his wine, intending to drain the entire glass because this conversation had really just taken place, but then he stopped and peered into the cup. There were no reflections on the surface of the dark liquid, not even from the lights. He sniffed the wine and noticed the slightest hints of sandalwood.

"Excuse me, Council Member," he said. "My wine has been poisoned."

"Has it indeed?" asked Haverton. He gave Draco an obvious wink. "What a terrible thing to happen!"

Draco glanced at Haverton's half-empty glass. "Yours is too."

He turned on his heel, leaving Haverton spluttering behind him. Draco handed his glass to the Auror four feet behind him.

"Check this for Ryson's," he ordered.

Draco didn't stay after that. He informed Kingsley that he was leaving, and to stop drinking the wine, and headed home. Sometimes parties were just more trouble than they were worth.

oOoOoOoOoOo~oOoOoOoOoOo~oOoOoOoOoOo

It was election night. All across England, parties were being held for the candidates. There would be fine dining, dancing, speeches and toasts, and Percy had been invited to all of them. As a mere formality of course, because it wasn't like he could actually go to them. He had votes to help collect and count and an Executive Council to meet with to confirm the winner, and then he would inform the lucky candidate. Technically he could go, just for a dinner, but then he would be showing favoritism.

Instead Percy put a late night in the office, getting everything ready for the new Minister (which would be Kingsley Shacklebolt). He then dismissed his Auror bodyguards, telling them he was going to have dinner sent up and wait for the Wizengamot to arrive. They waited to check his meal (because of the wine-poisoning scare at the luncheon three days ago) and then left to take up positions by the elevators, just in case Percy changed his mind about going home.

Percy didn't, but after he finished his meal, he Portkeyed to his office, and from there made his way to the Civis Arma meeting.

"Sorry I'm late," he said. The rest of the Arma was already seated at the round table.

"It's not a problem," said Kelly. "We only have a few things on the agenda for today. Percy, did you manage to speak with Draco Malfoy?"

"I did," said Percy. "He assures me that when Kingsley Shacklebolt is elected, he will withdraw from the Order."

"He can't know that Shacklebolt will get election," Rudy objected.

"Draco Malfoy overthrew Tierney doing the opening questions of a court case. If he can get rid of a Minister in a matter of minutes, I'm sure he can get one elected by the end of a week. Not to mention, with Harry Potter's public support, the man could be an absolute idiot, and still become Minister."

And for all Percy knew, Kingsley could be an idiot. He sincerely hoped not.

"He assured us," said Kelly, "but that doesn't mean he will withdraw."

"Apparently, if a crucial bit of information arises, Shacklebolt will relay it to the Order, and visa versa, but that is to be the extent of their contact. I do have access to most of the Minister's communications, so if anything untoward were to take place, I will make you all aware of it, and we can discuss what actions should be taken."

"What's being designated as crucial?" asked Jonathan Felix.

"I actually have an example with me," said Percy.

He pulled a file out of his attaché. "I discovered this when cleaning out Tierney's things. Apparently, our dearly deposed Minister was doing a little bit of snooping. These are Auror files on one Vincent Bickle. He was a thief twenty to thirty years ago and a total loot of six million galleons is attributed to him. He was arrested a few times, but always managed to escape. He fell off the grid over fifteen years ago and it is suspected that he fled to Germany. Does his name ring a bell with anyone?"

No one answered.

"You think he's important?" Rudy finally asked.

"Not to us," said Percy, "but we're not trying to take down Voldemort. We're just here to keep this country functioning. I was planning on showing this to Shacklebolt tomorrow. If it's important, then he can pass it on."

"And you said Tierney had dug this information up," said Kelly. "You think it was for Voldemort."

"I believe so."

"Do you think Tierney told Voldemort?"

"He got the file the day before the trial. He might have, but there's no way of knowing for sure."

"Tell Shacklebolt," said Kelly. "We can't keep this country running with Voldemort around."

The rest of the table agreed.

"There is something I won't be telling Shacklebolt. Something that three other people beside myself know, well, Voldemort probably knows as well." Percy took a breath. "The body of Lucius Malfoy is missing."

Silence.

"Wait," said Rudy. "Missing as in some guards vented post-death frustrations by tossing the corpse into the ocean, or missing as in Malfoy is an evil genius and managed to fool everyone and fake his death and then got up and walked out of the morgue and is now laughing at us all?"

"The Warden believes that some of his guards are responsible for stealing the body and, as you said, vented post-death frustrations. However, there is no way to know for sure."

"Of course there is," said Kelly. "We need to put those guards under Veritaserum."

"All of them?" asked Percy. "Right now four people know, maybe six if we count to guilty parties. We don't want this to leak. Even if the body was stolen, you know stories will be made, about sightings of Malfoy and general panic will ensue, not to mention the entire security of Azkaban will be compromised. It will be a mess and we don't have time to clean it up."

"If Malfoy escaped, then the security at Azkaban should be called into question. This isn't some petty thief-,"

"Because there are so many of those at Azkaban," Rudy interjected.

Kelly shot him a glare and continued. "This is Lucius Malfoy, right hand man of Voldermort. He assassinated Minister Fudge. This is why we were called! To uphold the law when it gets tossed aside by evil men and when it gets discarded by good men in times of war!"

"I'm not saying that Malfoy doesn't deserve to be hunted down and sent back to Azkaban," said Percy. "And even saying that is preposterous because Malfoy is dead, all checks confirmed that, there is no way around it- I'm simply saying that in the end, Malfoy gave all his money to his son, who we know is on our side. Malfoy knew Voldemort set him up. Why would he join the man who betrayed him? And again, this is ridiculous because Lucius Malfoy is dead. Unless resurrection is now possible-,"

"Well, there was that one time," said Rudy.

Percy shot him a glare. "Unconfirmed and irrelevant. Unless resurrection is now possible, Lucius Malfoy is one hundred percent, absolutely, certifiably dead. Any questions?"

For once even Rudy kept quiet. Percy let out a sigh and slumped in his chair. His head was throbbing.

"I didn't mean to yell," he said quietly.

"You didn't," said Rudy. "You were just…very forceful. I may only be speaking for myself, but I found it rather startling. I didn't know you had it in you."

Oh, he had it in him alright. It wasn't like hair this fiery came without the temper.

"Anyway, back to my original point," he said. "This is something I will not be sharing with Kingsley Shacklebolt. He would only tell Draco, and I don't think that's something he needs on his plate."

"But he's requesting the body," said Kelly. "That's one of the reparations he's demanding."

"So we'll put a fake in. I doubt he's going to look very hard."

"But what if it turns out the body wasn't stolen?" asked Helena quietly.

"Then it'll be a surprise," said Percy. "That's all I have to cover. Anyone else?"

And the meeting continued. It wasn't a surprise when, at 12:01 that night (or the next morning), Percy opened the door to congratulate the new Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt.

oOoOoOoOoOo~oOoOoOoOoOo~oOoOoOoOoOo

Quick confession. Another reason it was late (besides the moving to a new state thing), the chapter was really boring, so I made it better with a few attempts on Draco's life. It really only makes sense after all. It's not like Voldemort is going to sit back while Draco takes the election.





32. The Hunt Begins Again

Disclaimer: Not mine, but they're on my Christmas list.

Author's Note: Three hours late…oops. Also, very little time for editing because I started grad school. My bad.

ooooooooooo—ooooooooooooo-ooooooooooooo

Draco saw the last guest out and waited for the magic-propelled carriage to roll down the drive. It was late. The long, cobblestone drive leading to the estate was lit with floating paper lanterns, each as brilliant and golden as the stars in the dark sky above. Draco turned back into the ballroom, decked out in red and gold, in honor of Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt, candidate for Minister. When the news of his election had come, a little after midnight, ruby red confetti had fallen from seemingly nowhere, glittering thick in the room and disappearing as soon as it hit the floor. Never let it be said that the Malfoy family did not know how to throw a party.

Now the ballroom was in the disarray common to political parties. Empty wine glasses and tiny entrée plates littered the linen-covered tables and every other horizontal surface. A few personal belongings, four coats, three purses, two scarves, a pair of shoes, a wallet and a pocket watch, had been left behind. Draco would see to it they were returned to their proper owners. Several streamers had been pulled down, or had fallen, and were now trailing on the floor. A banner was crumpled in one corner, the drink and appetizer tables were stained liberally. Even the charmed tablecloths couldn't keep red wine and chocolate smears invisible.

Draco scanned the room, noting who was still present and awake. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were sitting on a low bench on the side of the room, deep in conversation. Fred and George were attempting to slide down the long, curving banister by the stairs without their father noticing. Sirius was acting as a look-out for the twins. The Golden Trio, along with Ginny, was sitting around the dessert table. Ron was picking at a platter of éclairs while Ginny and Hermione chatted. Harry looked like he was nearly asleep.

It was late, going on two in the morning. Draco was used to late nights, but even he was exhausted. This campaign had taken a lot out of him, not because he had done so much, but because he had been forced to delegate the majority of the work after the incident with Claire. Delegating was something Draco was very good at – when he had hand selected the individuals he would be directing. Being forced to assign tasks to the members of the Order who had no real professional training in politics played havoc with his somewhat obsessive personality. Not only did he have to explain the task to the Order members, he couldn't stop himself from double-checking their work.

Now, though, it was over and finished and Draco was glad. Politics was something he mostly enjoyed in abstract. While there was a real satisfaction in dethrowning or crowning a leader, the accomplishment was accompanied by stress, frustration, and hours of agonizing boredom. It was not enough to tempt Draco into a career in the government.

Draco quietly passed through the ballroom, snagging two still-full glasses of champagne from the drink table, and then slipped through the open French doors and onto the terrace. He stared out over the lantern-lit side garden and tossed back the first glass. He had refrained from alcohol at the banquet, drinking sparkling grape juice instead – a trick he'd learned from Lucius in order to stay completely alert and competent, but now he needed to unwind.

"Hiding?" asked a light voice from behind him.

Draco didn't turn, but his lips quirked up. "Not from you."

He sipped at his second glass. He heard the soft click of high-heeled shoes as Ginny came to stand beside him. He glanced over, appreciating the way the moonlight and soft glow of the lanterns lit her skin. The beaded straps of her silk dress were draped artfully over her arms, baring her shoulders. Her skin seemed to shimmer in the light.

Her head turned and she caught his gaze. He knew she flushed, but it was indistinguishable in the dim light. The moonlight painted everything in shades of blue, except her hair. The night could only temper the brilliance.

"You look tired," she said.

Soft strands of music filtered out from the ballroom, as gentle as her words.

"You look divine," he returned.

"I'm tired too," she responded, forcing back a yawn.

Draco finished off the champagne and set the two glasses on the marble rail bordering the terrace.

"I feel like we weren't even at the same party," she said, a laugh in her voice which meant she understood. They hadn't even been able to dance together. "Were you able to enjoy yourself at all?"

He'd never hosted his own gala before; he had never been in charge of everything from the guest list to the entertainment. Perhaps he should have started on a smaller scale, but Malfoy's never did anything by halves.

"I'd have more fun at your party," Draco said.

The music from the ballroom changed. He took her hand and guided her to the middle of the veranda. She rested her other arm on his shoulder, he pressed his hand to her waist, and pulled her into a sweeping waltz.

They danced well together. She moved naturally with him, not afraid to let him lead her into a complicated series of steps and turns, ones that he perfected after years of instruction but that she wouldn't have known. The waltz was a stirring one. He moved them throughout the expanse of the terrace, expertly avoiding the selection of chairs and tables. She laughed when he spun her out, and eagerly reached for his hand when he guided her close again. The closing strains of the waltz found them once more in the center of the patio, their steps slowing with the final ritardando, a traditional revolution back to the beginning.

Ginny smiled up at him, her hand rising to brush through his hair.

"Why do you have to be so perfect?" she whispered.

He wasn't perfect. He knew how flawed he was, and she, of all people, knew that he had his struggles. The question then was what brought on the sentiment. He tried to peer into her eyes, but she glanced away. Her body tensed, leaning away from him. He didn't understand.

"Ginny," he said.

Perhaps if he wasn't so exhausted he'd be able to understand. Perhaps if they weren't in heavy shadow he could read her features. Perhaps if he weren't so incredibly thick when it came to emotions and relationships…

"Ginny," he said again, because she had to understand that he was at sea right now, and it frustrated him to no end, but regret never changed a damn thing.

"It's nothing," she said, looking back up at him and smiling. And it was a real smile, not a fake one, and all previous tension was gone. She had put aside the melancholy, an expert at bringing out only the appropriate emotions and he hated to think of why she had to develop that skill. Her parents believed that all memory of her encounter with Tom Riddle was gone. That she never remembered a thing. Even Dumbledore thought that.

He frowned at her, but then she stepped closer.

"It's alright," she said. "I'll tell you later. Not now. This night is too lovely to spoil."

Her arm reached up, twining around his neck and guiding his head down. He offered no resistance, just his lips. She kissed him, sweetly and gently, and he responded in kind. It wasn't really his style at all, but he was tired and this way he could take in every detail, from the caress of her tongue to the way her hair felt through his fingers.

His right hand dropped to her waist and slid over thin silk. He could feel the heat of her skin through the dress and he pulled her closer. He tugged her slightly off balance, but her lips never left his. She simply tightened her grip on his shoulders until she steadied.

She shouldn't know how to kiss like that, like she was stealing every sense from him. He couldn't hear the music anymore; he couldn't see the lights or the red of her hair because his eyes had fallen shut. There was only her, her heat, her touch, the smell of her perfume, and he knew the scents, he knew what ingredients had gone into that bottle, but Merlin, he couldn't name them for the life of him. She inhaled a quick breath, stealing his air as well. She was the only thing anchoring to this time and place, and suddenly he realized, although she was taking everything with that kiss, she was giving all of her in return

He might have gasped into the kiss, or whispered an oath. His right hand settled on her bare shoulder and her skin was soft and hot, nearly burning to his cold touch. It threatened to wash over him. His fingers drifted down and then flinched as he brushed the cool glass of the beaded strap. It taunted him, that strap. Already fallen like a lover had slipped it over her shoulders. One little nudge, it seemed to promise, just one more little slip and her dress was the next thing to fall. Merlin damn that dress.

He broke the kiss, stepping back and pulling in a deep breath of gardenia-scented air. He glared; Ginny frowned with kiss-reddened lips.

"I'm not buying you anymore dresses," he told her.

Her frowned smoothed with a laugh. She spun, the skirt flaring out, just high enough to tease.

"You don't like it?" she asked.

When she moved, the thin silk alternated between flowing out with the motion of her hips, and outlining her entire leg. Now that she was here, standing in front of him, the taste of her lips still on his tongue, Draco wondered how he had ignored her this entire night.

"I need a drink," said Draco.

"You need to go to bed," Ginny countered. She yawned, almost violently. "So do I."

"My room's closer," Draco offered because he knew she would say no.

Ginny laughed. "I guess I'll walk you there."

She held out her hand and he took it. He guided her down the terrace steps because it was quicker to walk outside. She rested her head on his shoulder as they walked and swung their entwined hands.

She left him by his bedroom door, kissing his cheek and then continuing down the hall. He watched her go because she deserved the attention, especially in that dress. He was definitely not buying her anymore of those dresses, at least not for public events.

He stepped inside his room and ran a hand through his hair. He had been tired, before Ginny joined him on the terrace, but now his mind was fully awake. Kissing Ginny was never the best way to get ready to sleep.

Instead he took a shower, to shock his body into wakefulness, and spent an hour writing thank you cards to those who assisted the campaign. The mundane activity helped his mind shut down and after he signed off the last one, he crawled into his bed and closed his eyes. Sleep came easily.

He was walking through the Labyrinth in the back garden of Malfoy Estate. He'd known the way out since he was six and so he felt no fear hedged in by tall, green branches. Still, his steps were quickening. He almost didn't know why, he didn't know if he was running towards or from something.

He broke into a sprint, not realizing he was bare foot until his feet started slapping the hard clay tiles. He looked down. He was wearing the gray trousers and collared, short-sleeved shirt of his childhood, his 'playtime' clothes, the closest thing to casual Narcissa allowed. He often took his shoes and socks off in defiance of her edict. She never knew because she never saw him to see if her demands were followed.

He didn't stop or slow. He could see the exit to the maze. He burst through the hedges, but no, he wasn't out, he was still in the labyrinth, in the center, the very middle. The gold fountain was there, water bubbling and trickling down the many basins. He stepped closer. The flow of the water increased. The bubbling stream turned to rapids. The water spilled over the sides of the basin in clear sheets like glass. He stepped forward. He could see his own reflection, his face and another behind him. A hand fell on his shoulder. He spun around.

He saw Lucius.

"Draco."

"Draco."

Draco opened his eyes and sat up. It took him a second to get his bearings, just a second and then he looked over and saw Bill standing in the door of his room.

"Sorry to wake you," said Bill.

"It's fine," said Draco automatically. "What time is it?"

He looked to the clock even as Bill said, "Nine-thirty."

Nine-thirty. He'd slept in.

"What's happened?" he asked.

His sleep clothes felt sweaty. His face and neck did too. He hoped his hair didn't show it.

"Kingsley sent us an owl. You're going to want to see this."

From his tone, it was good news. Draco nodded.

"I'll be down in ten."

Bill nodded as well, but then tilted his head to the side. "You alright?" he asked.

"Yeah," said Draco, then because he was making an effort to be more open, "I had a dream."

"Bad dream?" asked Bill.

"No. Just…weird." He pushed his covers back. "I'm going to take a shower."

Bill took the dismissal well. "See you at breakfast," he said.

Perhaps there were benefits to this 'openness' thing.

Draco was at the dining room in thirteen minutes; the dream had been harder to shake than he would have liked. From the chatter over the table, and the presence of Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Tonks, and Lupin, whatever Kingsley had sent was important.

"Kingsley sent us an owl," said Dumbledore as Draco sat down.

"So Bill said. His exact words too."

Dumbledore handed him a fine sheet of parchment embossed with the Minister's seal. Draco poured a cup of coffee as he read the short missive.

Hello to you all. My assistant brought this to my attention. Apparently Tierney was digging up information on our thief, most likely for Voldemort. Looks like he did our work for us.

Draco put the letter down. "What was it he sent?"

Dumbledore slid over a thick, Auror file. Draco opened the folder and read the name at the top. He glanced through the list of reported and suspected crimes. He took a sip of his coffee.

"Well?" Sirius prodded.

Draco nodded. "It could be him."

"Could be, or is him?"

"The timeline fits. His skill level seems adequate to have broken the Jordayne safe. I'd say he's our best fit. We won't know one hundred percent until we find the goblet." He looked over to Dumbledore. "Is there a chance Tierney already gave this information to Voldemort?"

"There is."

Draco flipped through the other pages. "It doesn't give us an exact location, but there are reports that he was seen in Germany. And, according to this…," he trailed off and looked over at Dumbledore. "Black Water."

Dumbledore nodded.

"Where?" asked Harry.

Draco snapped his fingers and Tolly appeared.

"Yes, master?" the house elf asked, bowing low.

"Get us wizarding maps of Black Water and the surrounding area."

Tolly disappeared with a light pop. Draco took another sip of his coffee and picked out a pumpernickel roll from the platter in front of him. Tolly appeared with the maps and the Order quickly cleared the breakfast platters form the middle of the table. Dumbledore helped him unfurl the sheets.

"Here," said Draco, pointing to an area on the edge of the German border.

"It's an old town," said Dumbledore. "It has been inhabited since before the times of Merlin."

"Wait," said Mr. Weasley. "I remember reading about it in the paper."

Draco smirked as the older members of the Order began to recognize the name.

"It was a mining town," he explained to those his age. "Twenty-five years ago, the mines hit a large strain of silver, and the commerce flourished. The mines expanded, people moved in, and Black Water was renamed Gainesville after the owner of the mine. The town grew but was forced to expand east because of the mines, closer to the Soporis Silva, the Sleeping Woods. When our thief Vincent Bickle left for the town, it was still flourishing."

"Don't tell me the monsters got them," said Sirius, rolling his eyes. He would have been in Azkaban when the story broke.

"The monsters did get them," said Draco. "There was an epidemic of lycanthrope started by three werewolves hunting in a pack. The only time that happens is when a family is turned together because otherwise, werewolves are solitary creatures. It's a rare occurrence. Gainesville was still a relatively new success and largely secluded. The trains hadn't reached the town yet.

"There are three nights when a sufferer from Lycanthrope will shift into wolf form. In those three nights, four hundred people were massacred and nearly two hundred had been turned. The population to begin with was a little over eleven hundred. By the time the Suppression Squad heard of the attack and arrived, the town had been halved. The three original werewolves were hunted down and killed. What remains of their bodies still hang in cages over the courthouse and the town was renamed Black Water."

"And we have to go there?" Ron asked, his voice three and a half-notes higher than usual.

"It's a ghost town now," said Draco.

"Deserted?" asked Harry.

Draco looked over. "A ghost town where half or more of the population is incorporeal. Ghosts, poltergeists, ghouls, shadow people, and most from the massacre. The living who still inhabit Black Water are mostly researchers and those hiding from the law. If Bickle didn't die, he's still there." Draco shrugged. "Even if he did die, he might still be there."

"Or someone might be able to tell us where he went," said Dumbledore.

"So what's the plan?" asked Sirius.

"We won't all travel to Black Water, for several reasons," said Dumbledore. "The first being that we need to keep a low profile. If Tierney was able to give this information to Voldemort, the Death Eaters might already be there. If Voldemort does not know, he may be watching us in hopes we lead him to the horcrux."

"If Voldemort does beat us to the goblet, will he immediately bond it to himself to increase his power?" asked Remus. "The ritual is demanding, so we might have a chance at retrieving it even if Voldemort gets there first."

"We don't know if he will incite the bond now," Draco responded. "He could want to find it and keep it as a safety measure, that was the reason he created them in the first place."

"Draco is correct," said Dumbledore. "When the resistance became too much of a threat, he resorted to horcruxes to stay alive. He has already bonded with two of his horcruxes and the results are impressive to say the least. He might decide the best course of action is to hide the horcrux again."

"What type of results?" Bill asked.

Dumbledore turned to Severus.

"He has been cautious," Snape reported. "Even with his followers, he has not shown the true extent of his power. Still, I have overseen him display rudimentary control over the elements, he has the ability of flight, and his Legilimancy is…threatening."

"How much would this last horcrux increase his power?" Tonks asked.

"Impossible to say," said Dumbledore. "The horcruxes are a part of human soul. When created, they grow, feeding off of the surrounding magical energy, usually dark magic. In a place like Black Water, the horcrux could be tremendously powerful. We must hope the Jordayne safe has tempered its growth."

"Who's going?" asked Ginny.

Harry immediately raised his hand. "I'll go."

"Me too," Hermione and Ron chimed in unison.

"Harry's not going without me," said Sirius.

"I'm afraid that the town is not entirely friendly towards my kind," said Remus. "I would bring unwanted attention."

"I could go," said Bill. "You never know when you might need a curse-breaker." He looked over, catching Draco's gaze. "It could be fun."

"I doubt fun," said Draco. "But I'll go too. You never know when you might need a genius."

Bill laughed.

"I want to go," said Ginny.

Draco was waiting for her to announce her intentions in joining the group. He also knew she wasn't going to take 'no' for an answer.

"Ginny, no," said Mrs. Weasley. "It's dangerous. You're still a child."

"Don't even try that excuse," said Ginny. "Ron was younger when he went to the Ministry with Harry."

"And if we'd known about it, we would have stopped him from going."

"So because I'm asking permission, I don't get to go."

"Precisely," said Mr. Weasley.

Ginny looked over to Dumbledore. "My presence would be useful. I've already been possessed by one horcrux. I'll be able to sense the other one, won't I?"

"Yes, but so will Harry because of his scar. That link should be enough."

"But if there are two of us, we could break into groups and halve our search time. My marks in defense are exemplary, I won't be a hindrance."

"Ginny, your mother already said no," Arthur warned.

Ginny didn't look over; she was still locking gazes with Dumbledore.

"Your daughter has a point," Dumbledore finally conceded. "With your permission, Arthur and Molly, she would be a great help."

Draco saw the reluctance on her parents' faces. They seemed to hold a silent confirmation before Mrs. Weasley's shoulders slumped and Mr. Weasley took her hand.

"Ginny, we want you to be safe," Arthur started.

"Draco won't let anything happen to me," said Ginny quickly.

Everyone looked his way. Draco was a little startled at the attention, but Ginny spoke only what he had decided in his mind.

"I will do everything in my power to get her back safely," he promised.

He could see his words didn't mean much. He wasn't surprised or bothered by their disbelief. They had known him as an enemy for most of his life.

"I'll be there too," said Bill. "Between me and Draco, someone will always have an eye on her."

Bill surprised Draco. He knew the oldest sibling was horrendously protective of the youngest. He wondered what made him agree to Ginny's participation; Ginny's proof of assistance or Draco's promise.

"Mum, dad, please. I need to do this."

Or perhaps it was the eager, hopeful, begging expression on Ginny's face. Draco doubted that face was rarely denied anything.

"Very well," said Arthur. "But Ginny, you have to promise to do whatever Bill or the others tell you. No reckless behavior, understand?"

"Absolutely," said Ginny immediately. She grinned and shot Draco an excited look. Draco rolled his eyes because only Gryffindors would get excited about walking into possible near-death scenarios.

"Then it is decided," said Dumbledore. "I will see to our travel arrangements, and later tonight, we will meet again to discuss our plans."

And that was everyone's cue to fall back to normal conversation for the rest of breakfast. Beside him, Ginny practically vibrated excited energy.

"Most likely it will be horrendously dull," he told her. "We'll walk through old buildings, poke around in attics, inhale dust and cobwebs, and if we're lucky, find the horcrux."

Ginny shook her head. "It's the first thing I'm allowed to do," she explained. "Ron has forever been having adventures with Harry while I've been stuck a grade behind."

"You were in the DA two years ago," said Draco.

"Which you so rudely interrupted," Ginny accused.

Draco shrugged unapologetically. "Working for Umbridge had its perks."

"Like what?"

"End of the year party with the two barrels of firewhiskey we confiscated from the seventh year Hufflepuffs," said Draco.

"You're such a Slytherin," said Ginny.

Draco smirked. "Thank you."

After breakfast, he adjourned to his study. He had no doubt that Dumbledore would have a fully functional array of instruments for their sojourn into Black Water, but he was lord of Malfoy Manor and had access to quite a few tools Dumbledore might not even consider.

He jotted down a quick list of things he would need Tolly to purchase, or scrounge up from some closet in the estate, and then stood up. He immediately sat back down again when there was a knock and Harry entered his study looking a little hesitant.

ooooooooooooo—ooooooooooooo-ooooooooooooo

Harry knocked softly on the door and then entered Draco's study. The blond had just risen from a large, cluttered desk, a paper in his hand, but when he saw Harry he immediately sat back down. Harry wondered what Draco could tell by looking at him. He could no doubt see his hesitance, but could he know why? Sometimes, Harry thought Draco was a little…intimidating.

"Problem, Potter?" Draco asked.

The Slytherin raised one eyebrow. Like right now he was intimidating, because when Draco got that blank expression with the arched eyebrow, he looked like he was studying some lesser sort of being. Like he was a scientist, staring down at a collection of beetles, and wondering if they were worth his time to study, or if he should just squash the bunch.

Harry mutely shook his head because he suddenly wondered if the blond had the power to simply crush everyone in his home. He watched Draco's eyebrows narrow, and then Draco was sitting up, his expression clearing.

"Well, I need you for a moment anyway," he announced.

And then Draco was pulling things off of the shelves in the study and dumping them on the table in the middle of the room. He tossed Harry something that looked oddly like a Muggle mouthguard.

"Put that in," Draco ordered.

Harry turned it over in his hands, not sure he wanted to. "What's it for?" he asked.

"You," said Draco distractedly, paging through a few books, and it was amazing how he could go from aloof, to intent, to distracted in the space of a few seconds, "when you speak Parseltongue, are pronouncing words the average human mouth should not be able to form. The human mouth simply isn't designed the same way as a snake's. There is a different palate, a different tongue, different teeth."

Harry hadn't thought of the physical impediments to the snake language before. He'd assumed it was just magic, and that magic being magic, could do a lot of impossible things. Being thrust into a world of charms and spells without any background know-how had made him assume there weren't any limitations to magic.

"So, how do I speak it?" he asked, stepping closer to the table.

Draco looked up at him. "Magic," he said simply. "I'm assuming, that is. I'm actually hoping I'll find a mutation in the structure of your mouth. Most Parselmouths are direct descendants from Salazar Slytherin, which would suggest a genetic mutation, but you aren't related to him in anyway. So, unless you happen to have the exact same genetic mishap as Salazar, it's a sort of magical interference I haven't seen before."

Harry took a moment to absorb that information. "I see," he said finally.

Draco gestured for him to put the mouthplate in, and Harry reluctantly fit it in. It immediately adhered to his teeth and stretched out across the roof of his mouth. It wasn't exactly uncomfortable, but it felt odd. Harry explored the odd mouthplate with his tongue.

"What does this do?" he asked.

He stepped forward as Draco turned a book around for him to see the page. There, on the white paper, a diagram was forming. It looked to be the inside of a mouth, with teeth and muscles and ligaments.

"Is that my mouth?" Harry asked, and then stared as the diagram on the page moved as he spoke.

"Yes," Draco confirmed. "On this page, I have the movement of your jaw, and over here…," he flipped over a few pages, "is the exact motion of your tongue and lips. I need you to read the words marked here."

Draco handed him the Parseltongue journal Harry had made with Hermione's help. Nearly half the words on the page were preceded by a black dash.

It wasn't difficult to speak in Parseltongue, but it took a specific frame of mind. Harry had to stretch for that feeling, had to imagine a snake right there in front of him, and then looked down at the page. He read off the words there, hissing and occasionally spitting. Now that Draco had mentioned some sort of magic, he was aware of the way his tongue undulated around the words. It not only sounded foreign, it felt foreign.

He reached the bottom of the list and Draco gestured for him to keep going. Harry turned the page, saw that over half of these words were marked, and continued reading.

"That's fine," Draco interrupted halfway through that list. "I've got what I need."

Harry pulled the mouthpiece out. "What do I do with his?"

"Just toss it," said Draco. "I certainly don't want it anymore."

Harry looked around and saw the rubbish bin by the door. He tossed the plate in and then walked back to the table.

"What did it tell you?" he asked.

Draco didn't answer for a moment. He was flipping through the book of diagrams, frowning. Harry watched as Draco's right hand rubbed his left arm absently and the frown twisted into a grimace.

"Does it hurt?" Harry asked.

Draco glanced over, eyebrow raised, and Harry pointed at his arm. Draco seemed surprised to see his hand clamped around his arm.

"Sometimes my scar hurts when I speak Parseltongue," said Harry.

Draco's eyes narrowed, and he let go of his arm, staring at his shirt sleeve for a moment.

"Were you scared?" Harry blurted, surprising himself and Draco. The cold grey eyes turned to him. "It's just that… I don't think I've seen you really scared before, even when you're facing Voldemort."

"Is there a point to this, Potter?" Draco asked, pushing the books to the side and leaning on the table.

"I have to kill Voldemort," said Harry.

"Oh, is that what the whole 'Chosen One' thing is about?" asked Draco, sarcasm tainting his voice.

"Shove it, Malfoy, I'm serious," said Harry. "That's what the prophecy says."

Now Draco raised an eyebrow again, but instead of looking distant this time, he was intrigued. "So there is a prophecy. I thought it was just a rumor, or just a vague mention of war and they stuck your name on it."

"It's a real prophecy," said Harry.

Draco paused, his forehead furrowed. "Alright, you've got me," he said, after a moment. "What are you trying to say, or are you just looking for a heart-to-heart? I'm a genius, not a therapist."

"I have to kill Voldemort," said Harry again, because this was part of his point.

"Because the prophecy says you have to," said Draco.

"Him or me," Harry agreed. "But recently… Dumbledore's been looking at me weird."

Draco's lips twitched. "Tell him you're flattered, but just not interested."

Harry stared, confused, and then he realized what Draco meant. He felt a flash of anger.

"Damn it, Malfoy," he snapped. "This is serious."

His outburst had Draco staring at him again, but then the blond nodded and sat down. Harry pulled out a chair as well and took a deep breath.

"Dumbledore told me the prophecy at the end of fifth year," he started, but Draco was already interrupting.

"End of fifth year?" he asked. "How long has he known the prophecy?"

"Since I was born."

Harry watched as Draco put his hands flat on the table. "Since you were born? And he didn't feel like you needed to know before? Merlin Potter, you've been a target since you first appeared in Diagon Alley. What was Dumbledore thinking?"

"He didn't want to burden me with it," said Harry.

"But everyone already thought you would be the one to kill him simply because of your scar. What's wrong with giving you a heads-up?"

"He thought it was right," said Harry with a shrug because he couldn't change things now. "Anyway, before he told me, he spent all fifth year avoiding me, and sometimes giving me these looks, like I was fated for a tragic end and beyond his help."

"And now he's doing the same thing," said Draco.

"Yeah," said Harry. He screwed up his face in distaste because it really was disconcerting.

"And you want to know if I know anything," Draco guessed.

Harry nodded. "I know that Dumbledore might confide in you, ask for your opinion on things."

Draco shook his head. "He hasn't. Not about you, at least."

"Could you…could you keep an ear open for me?" Harry asked. He tensed at the question, not knowing how Draco would take it.

"You want me to spy for you?" asked Draco. "On Dumbledore?"

"Yes?" said Harry, the affirmative coming out as a question. To his relief, Draco smiled.

"I'm impressed, Potter. We'll make a Slytherin of you yet."

"It's not that I don't trust him," said Harry quickly. "It's just that… I know that I might die fighting Voldemort. It's a real possibility, and I've been living with that for two years now, and I'm okay with it."

Draco raised an eyebrow.

"No, I am," said Harry. "I mean, I'd rather not, but in the long run, someone has to do it. And I'm okay with that being me. But… I need to know if Dumbledore has something he's not telling me. I need to be able to face it. The last time I was kept in the dark, people died, and if that happens again," Harry had to swallow, thinking about Sirius, "well, it can't happen again."

He looked up at Draco and kept the grey gaze without looking away. Draco finally nodded.

"I'll do what I can. Keep my ears open."

"That's not all," said Harry, and he saw the trepidation cross Draco's face. "I want you to listen to this and tell me what you think." He took a breath, and then started. "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approach-,"

He cut off as Draco threw out a hand and recoiled.

"Merde, Potter," the Slytherin swore. "You sure you want to fill me in on this? I mean, yes, I'm curious and I want to know, and yes, Dumbledore not telling you anything else is a little…manipulative, but sit back and think about it for a minute."

Harry smiled because, really, Draco wasn't as Slytherin as he wished to be.

"I need someone I can trust," he said.

"And you think that's me," said Draco.

"You want Voldemort dead, right?" Harry asked.

"Yeah, it'd be nice," said Draco.

"But you were going to stop me from telling you the prophecy."

"Because you can't know, one hundred percent, that you can trust me," said Draco.

"And that's exactly why I can."

He saw the blond scoff. "Your Gryffindor logic is so far below me, I don't understand it."

"Cut the crap, Malfoy," said Harry. "I know you get it. You don't want to, because it's all honesty and faith, but you understand. I need someone who won't keep me out of the loop. Dumbledore means well, but he's not particularly forthcoming. He's trying to protect me. He doesn't see that I don't need it anymore."

He watched, anxiously, as Draco leaned back in his chair and gave a sigh. "Alright," said the Slytherin, somewhat reluctantly. "Let's hear it."

Harry recited from memory. "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches, born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies. And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives."

Draco pursed his lips. "It does seem oddly specific," he said.

"Dumbledore said that when the prophecy was given it could refer to me or Neville, but Voldemort chose me and that marked me as his equal. And when he tried to kill me, my mother's love stopped him from destroying me."

Draco snorted. "Love? Seriously."

It figured that the blond would doubt that part of tale.

"It's true," Harry insisted. "Voldemort couldn't touch me until fourth year. I mean that literally. His skin burned whenever he touched me."

"It sounds ridiculous," said Draco.

"But it's why I'm still here today, because of her and because of her sacrifice. He wasn't trying to kill her, just me. She stood in the way."

"Alright, so we're talking sacrificial magic. I suppose it could happen." Draco still looked unconvinced.

"Do you notice anything about it?" asked Harry. "Something I haven't picked up yet?"

"Neither can live while the other survives. I hate to point out the obvious," said Draco drolly, "but both of you are alive right now."

"So what does that mean?" asked Harry.

"It means you have a really bad translation," said Draco.

"Translation?" asked Harry, because Trelawney had just spoken in English.

"Most prophecies are given in the Ancient Languages," said Draco. "Here, in this prophecy, 'live' should probably be translated to flourish. I think it's safe to say that Voldemort won't achieve world power if you are still alive. In the reverse, I don't think you will be safe if you don't kill him. You won't be able to ignore his presence."

"So I have to kill him or England is never safe."

"It does appear to point to you. What calendar is the prophecy using?"

"What do you mean?"

Draco sighed. "Well, if it's not English, the prophecy could be referring to an older calendar as well."

"But it's Trelawney who gave the prophecy," said Harry. "She gave me another one too. In English. I was right there to hear it. And then she didn't remember saying it."

Draco rubbed a hand over his face. "It doesn't make sense," he said. He sighed again. "I'll look into it."

The Slytherin suddenly looked so tired, Harry felt contrite. "I didn't mean to give you more work," he apologized.

Draco quirked his lips. "I'm not happy without work," he said.

"Still," said Harry, "you shouldn't have to do everything."

"Says the one who must kill Voldemort."

Harry gave a wry grin and stood. "Well, thanks, Draco."

"Anytime."

Harry gestured to the journal. "Did you figure out how I speak Parseltongue?"

Draco shrugged. "According to these diagrams, you shouldn't be."

oooooooooooo—ooooooooooooo-ooooooooooooo

Again, very little time to edit this chapter. I apologize for the typos and grammar. Next chapter should be up in two weeks. Please leave a review!





33. When Fear Becomes Real

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did…well, many happy things would happen.

Author's note: Hello all. I'm alive. However, grad school's keeping me busier than I thought it would. Between classes and homework and research and job stuff - and then they expect us to socialize with other students and the professors? - it's pretty intense. But, here is the next chapter. I shall endeavor to have the next one done in two weeks, but if it changes, I'll try to let you know beforehand. My apologies for the wait.

ooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooo

Draco pulled back the door on the train and a blast of frigid, damp air struck him as he stepped onto the platform. He reflexively sucked in a breath and immediately sneezed.

He pulled up short, nose still itching; he hadn't planned for this. He tentatively sniffed the air. The copper, salty smell of blood hit his nose, accompanied by the rich scent of peat and tinged with the odd tickle of a freshly opened bottle of paprika. It was the smell of death, death and insanity. There was nothing evil about death, or insanity. But when death collected, like it had in Black Water, the scent remained.

In purely technical terms, it wasn't a scent exactly. It was a presence, a magical signature that manifested itself through a synthetic synestesia in the form of an odor. Not every wizard was sensitized to the presence of death. It took repeated exposure. The same with evil. Evil smelled of sulfur and burnt flesh. It didn't take as much exposure because that scent was much stronger. Most dark wizards, or those raised in dark families, could recognize the smell. Those wizards only ate their meat cooked rare, or abstained from red meat entirely. There were very few barbeque restaurants in the wizarding world.

This scent, though, complicated things. He let his mind turn the matter over as he turned back to the train. He offered a hand to Hermione who was dressed like he was, long coat, hat, gloves and scarf. She was carrying a metal case. Draco didn't offer to relieve her of the burden. He was their protection, and he needed both hands free to draw his wand, should the need arrive.

He handed Ginny down next; Bill followed with a larger metal case. The cases were the only disguise they needed. Should anyone ask, Bill was a meteorological researcher studying the effects of the large conglomeration of ghosts on the atmosphere. Hermione was his partner. Ginny and Draco were lowly interns. No one would ask though. Only two types came into town, the ones running from the law and the academics. The perpetually cold weather meant the Order members didn't even have to worry about Polyjuice or physical disguises. Everyone wore hats and coats, even indoors because the ghosts carried the cold with them.

Bill gave a sniff to the air, as if confused. Draco figured that, as a former curse breaker, he was sensitive to the presence of death. Hermione was unaffected. Draco glanced over to Ginny. He saw her take a breath, and then her eyes darkened and lost their focus. It was like she was looking inward, searching for an answer, and then she blinked. She knew the scent as well.

"This way," said Draco.

He led them off the platform, skirting the station, and coming out onto a deserted street. There was hardly anyone out. Draco guided the others down two city blocks and over one, and they passed only two pedestrians. One had thick glasses and was carrying an armful of folders, the other was dressed completely in black, glancing furtively at the quartet before moving on.

For a ghost town, Black Water was well preserved. The sidewalk was still smooth, the buildings were empty but still standing and the glass windows were still intact. Only a few pieces of litter skittered across the street, driven by the biting wind. It was the cold that helped preserve this town. No one wanted to be outside long enough to graffiti, mug or murder. Smashed windows only let in frigid air.

The hotel was the only building on this block with lights on. Draco pushed open the door and stepped into the lobby, sweeping the room over before moving further in and letting the others enter behind him. It was still cold, even indoors. Draco could feel the heating charms and circulation vents doing their best to provide warmth, but they only managed to temper the winter cold to an autumn chill.

The lobby was full of academics with their gadgets and recording equipment out. While assistants or spelled quills took notes, the researchers gathered in groups for card games or chatter. They only noticed the new arrivals long enough to raise their still-mittened hands in a greeting. Out here, in the desolate town, everyone was a friend.

Draco waved in reply and retrieved the room keys from the front desk. They took the elevator up to the fourth floor and joined the rest of the expedition in the third room on the left.

"Right on time," said Dumbledore with a smile. "Any trouble on the trip in?"

Dumbledore, Sirius, Harry and Ron had arrived yesterday. Smaller groups would attract less attention.

"None at all," said Bill. He took a seat on the couch in the small sitting area. He didn't move to take off his coat, neither of them did. Harry and Ron were in thick jumpers and hats. Sirius was in his animagus form, even though Draco didn't remember that being part of the plan. Perhaps it was warmer to be covered by thick fur than dressing in layers.

"It's ridiculously cold," said Hermione, sitting next to Harry.

"The density of non-corporeal life forms will do that," Draco said wryly. He sat on a desk chair pulled over to form a rough circle. He glanced over to Dumbledore. "We have a complication."

"We do?" Bill asked, startled, even as Dumbledore nodded.

"I noticed it disembarking as well. This town has, unfortunately for us, absorbed some less-than-desirable energies. It is unlikely that Harry and Ginny will be able to sense the horcrux from a distance due to this…interference of auras."

"What does that mean?" Hermione asked.

Draco knew she understood the explanation, and was actually inquiring on how this affected their plan.

"With a limited range, Harry and Ginny would probably have to be standing right outside the house or building that the horcrux is in," said Draco. "Unless we wanted to walk past every structure in this town, we're going to have to narrow the location down."

"How?" Ron asked.

Draco got up. "I'm going to go scrounge up a cup of coffee," he said.

"And chat with the locals," said Dumbledore, anticipating his plan.

Draco smirked and left the room.

He headed back down to the lobby and crossed over to the complimentary coffee the hotel offered. Another man was helping himself to a cup and Draco nodded in greeting.

"I'm Dan Schulyk," said the man, sticking out his hand. "Magical signature investigator."

"Drake Matthews," said Draco, clasping his hand. "Meteorology."

"Here to find a way to make this place a little bit warmer?" Dan asked.

"Merlin, I hope so," said Draco, playing the part of a friendly intern.

Dan laughed. "You're fresh off the train, yeah?"

"Yeah."

"You'll get used to it," the researcher assured him. "I've been here four years now. Went home for Christmas and wore short sleeves. Come on and meet the rest of my team."

Draco followed him over to where a mini-lab was set up. Dan's team composed of two men and a woman who were currently enwrapped in a card game. From the five cards in hand, and three on the table, they were playing Fate. They weren't playing for money though, just small pieces of hard candy. This was one of the reasons Draco would never go into research. There was too much downtime while the machines collected data over a period of days, sometimes weeks. He would go insane.

He introduced himself to the team, making sure to be charming so that he was offered a seat. The woman, Lara, graciously offered him a handful of candies to play a couple of rounds. Draco accepted, the cards were dealt, and he was quizzed about the research he would be a part of.

Draco knew enough about weather charms to be convincing, and then he asked the team about their own research. By the fifth hand, Draco allowed himself to win a pot, and then he casually asked about any older abandoned buildings in the area.

"It's the equipment," he explained. "Along with the grant we were supposed to get a new weather tracker, but the big heads upstairs decided to be cheap and gave us a machine from the sixties. We've tried retrofitting it with ghost barriers and warming charms, but none of the spells want to stick. Do you know of any place with limited ghost activity? And preferably one where the machine won't walk off with new friends?" He alluded to the less than savory residents of Black Water with a small grimace.

"Most of the ghosts keep to themselves," said Dan. "Their deaths are still pretty new to them. What was it Jeff said?" He looked to Lara, and then, for Draco, "Jeff's the resident ghost expert."

"On average, it takes a ghost twenty to twenty-five years to seek out human interaction, disregarding relatives, of course," Lara recited.

"Still got some years to go, then," said Dan. "Most of the living residents of the town live on Crescent Street, and the ghosts keep around there."

"He could try the old library," offered one of the men.

"Too close to Crescent," Lara disagreed.

Draco took the deck of cards, as it was his turn to deal, and shuffled while the team debated among themselves. It took another three hands, but they finally decided on four possible locations. Neither of those four locations suited Draco's criteria for the possible location of the horcrux, but it was the places the team dismissed that he was more interested in, one in particular.

"You've all been a big help," he told them. "You've saved me countless hours of roaming the streets."

"We're happy to help," said Dan.

Draco gave his pile of candies back to Lara. He had doubled their number. He stood with a smile. "Thanks again. I think I better head back and check on the team."

He escaped after a few promises to join them for another game sometime, and traveled back upstairs to room 405.

"Any luck?" Bill asked.

"I think so," said Draco.

One Floo trip and ten minutes of walking, and the search party was standing outside an old house on the outskirts of Black Water. It was originally a manor of sorts, but Black Water had grown around in, eating up the land and placing a modern array of townhouses around the premises.

The manor was brick and nearly covered in climbing vines. It still appeared structurally sound though. The front garden was a miniature forest that threatened the entire front lawn and porch. The unbroken glass windows were a direct contrast to the neglect. Just what Draco was looking for.

"Why this house?" Ron asked with a certain amount of trepidation.

"Because no one who enters leaves with their right minds," said Draco. "Most people have learned to stay away. And it was abandoned when our thief fled to this town, meaning that he would have been able to stockpile his goods here."

"I'd like to leave with my right mind," Ron said.

"We're not entering with the intention to prove our mettle, or to pillage the house," said Draco. "The entities that still protect this house will know that. It will ease our passage."

"If you say so," Ron muttered, remaining unconvinced.

Draco unlatched the front gate and started up the moss-covered sidewalk. He slipped his hand inside his coat and pulled out his wand. His unregistered wand. For as much as he had spoken the truth to Ron, he had a feeling some darker spells might be called upon within the next few minutes.

He stepped up onto the front porch and waited for Dumbledore to catch up.

"On three?" the Headmaster asked.

"Your count," said Draco, raising his wand.

The door swung open with a creak.

"Because that doesn't say haunted house," said Ron behind him.

Draco's lips quirked and he started forward, but Bill caught onto the collar of his coat, halting his movement.

"Age before beauty, kid," said Bill, teasing to lighten the collective dread that had gathered on the front porch.

Draco scowled as Ron snickered. It wasn't as if he was completely unfamiliar with dark houses. In fact, he probably had the most experiences with such wards and precautionary spells. He waited with ill-grace as the adults moved into the house, casting revealing spells and shield charms. Amateurs. What they needed first was a perception filter to disguise their signatures from the wards.

"Alright, you can come in," said Bill. "But carefully."

Draco didn't wait for any further invitation. He crossed over the threshold and found himself in a large welcoming hall covered in accumulated grime and cobwebs. The house was still fully furnished though, which was a good sign. Precautions to prevent thieving meant that something in this house was worth guarding. Draco was hoping that something was Bickle's hoard of stolen goods. Of course, that also meant something was doing the guarding. Draco just hoped it wasn't a dragon.

He moved further in, the Golden Trio following behind him. It was dark in the hall. Only the dimmest of light made it through the dirt-encrusted windows and somewhere to the left, a flutter of wings sounded. Bats.

"Creepy," Hermione whispered to Harry, and her voice carried further than it should have, echoing throughout the hall.

If the house hadn't reeked of genuine decay, it would be almost laughable. It was a stereotypical haunted house.

"Where to?" Ron asked softly.

As if to answer his question, the chandelier over the landing of the stairs turned on. It was hung with cobwebs and dust and a behemoth moth took flight to hover wound the weak light. Ron shuddered.

"Upstairs, I believe," said Draco. He spoke at a normal volume, not worried about being heard. Whatever had protected this house already knew they had arrived. But what kind a creature was it? House elves were known to go a little feral after their masters disappeared. Poltergeists could become incredibly powerful, given the right environment, and Black Water definitely qualified. But it didn't quite fit. This house had been guarded and protected for years. It must be a guardian of sorts.

A brownie perhaps. Or maybe a kobold. A tomte, if it were old enough could wield considerable protective magic.

He started for the stairs, and Bill hurried to keep up.

"Merlin, Draco," Bill exclaimed softly. "How about you wait for some back-up, huh?"

Draco rolled his eyes but made no comment. The stairs turned at the landing, leading them up to another hall. This time the lights led them to the right, through a set of doors and into a large room. It was clean in here. The floor was polished wood, the drapes a deep shade of gold. The window glass was clear and the view was an enchanted beach scene. A table stood to the side, surface freshly polished. A tiny cabinet in the corner boasted a vase of fresh flowers. A matching, but larger cabinet sat on the opposite side of the room.

From the upkeep of this room, the house had a brownie. Draco grimaced. Brownies were notorious for their odd personalities and mischievous behavior. Mischievous was too kind of a word.

"Is anyone else a little confused?" Sirius asked, bringing up the rear of the group.

"I think it's in the cabinet," Harry said suddenly.

Draco looked over to see that Potter had paled slightly. His brow was furrowed and his hand was rubbing at his forehead. Draco wondered when he'd started noting the presence of the horcrux.

He stepped over to the cabinet and studied the lock. There was no key hole. Dumbledore pressed a hand against the wood.

"A vanishing cabinet," the Headmaster said in surprise. "Very rare. Unless I miss my guess, this leads somewhere else in the home."

The doors slammed shut behind the goup. Most jumped; Draco just smirked. He was similarly unsurprised when the cabinet in the corner jolted.

"What the hell?" Sirius demanded, just as the door to the tiny cabinet burst open and a little man popped out. His facial features were exaggerated and his ears large. He wore brightly striped pants, a yellow shirt, and shoes that turned up at the toes. His hair was white underneath a tiny bowler hat.

"Welcome ye unwelcomed visitors." The brownie bowed low, sweeping his hat off his head.

Draco bowed back, seeing Dumbledore do the same. The rest followed their example.

"We thank thee for the welcome," said Dumbledore. "We mean no harm to you or your home."

"Many have claimed the same," said the brownie. "What has brought you to my house?"

"We seek an item of value," said Dumbledore. "It was stolen, many years ago."

"And you are the rightful owner?" the little man challenged.

"No," said Dumbledore.

It was the right thing to say. Truth was held in high esteem with the brownies and they always knew a falsehood when they were told one.

"There is a lair," the brownie stated. "A hoard greater than that of the dragons of old, but the way is not easy."

These things were never easy. Draco exchanged a look of trepidation with Bill.

"Show us the way," said Dumbledore. "We are not short of courage."

The little man smiled and moved backwards, bowing low. "Courageous so you claim to be. Time will tell and we shall see. What do you know, it's time for tea. But a knock on the door, who could that be?"

The words were spoken in a high sing-song, ending in a giggle, and after the giggle there was a knock. And another. Harry stiffened and Sirius took a step forward. The knocking continued, it was coming from a chest in the far corner, half-hidden by the drapes.

"A Boggart," said Bill. "This house must be full of them."

Draco watched the brownie take up a wicker basket. The little man's eyes were too mischievous to make him worry, but Sirius did shout as the brownie threw open the flaps on the basket.

A large cloth flew out and settled over the table. Dishes and glasses followed next, then trays of cakes and biscuits and sandwiches, even a pot of soup and two bottles of wine, all whizzing through the air to settle on the table. A teapot was last, steam rising from its spout. The brownie had said it was tea time, but the fare was more of a luncheon.

"Courageous you must prove to be, or your prize you will not see," sang the brownie. "Prove your mettle, all you here. Gather your bravest to dine with fear."

"Why?" asked Sirius. "Is it poisoned?"

"I think he meant it literally," said Draco. "He wants us to dine with the Boggart."

The knocking started again. Draco hadn't realized it stopped until the rap sounded once more, slow and steady and methodical. Knock. Knock. Knock.

He already knew how this was going to play out, but he waited, wondering, hoping that someone else would take the initiative.

"Mine's a thunderstorm," said Ginny. "As long as we didn't mind getting a little wet…," she shrugged, letting her offer trail off.

"Mine's a Dementor," said Harry. "Probably not the best of ideas."

"Spider," said Ron. "Big, hairy, eight-legs. Poisonous, but it wouldn't really be poisonous, so if we trapped it, perhaps?"

"The difficulty lies with this house," said Dumbledore. "I thank you for your offers, but these boggarts have been living here for decades, perhaps longer."

"What does that mean?" asked Ginny.

"They can grow in power, like poltergeists," said Draco, answering for the Headmaster. "Ron, your boggart-spider might actually contain a sort of venom, not on scale like a real spider, but enough to cause harm. Ginny, your thunderstorm could get more than a little dangerous and, well, no one likes Dementors, even fake ones."

"Mine's bodies," said Hermione. She grabbed Harry's hand and Draco knew that her corpses would be those gathered here. "Bodies couldn't…get out of hand, could they?"

"But your real fear is failing those you care about," said Draco. "The bodies are just the tangible result of that failure."

"So…this super-boggart, or whatever, might actually harm all of you present, to make my fear real," Hermione deduced.

"I'm afraid so, Miss Granger," said Dumbledore.

Draco looked about the group, already indentifying each individual's fear. Sirius would be Harry's death. Dumbledore's was the same as Hermione's, and Bill's was the death of his family, real and adopted.

"Oh, bloody hell," he groaned.

"Would it be safe?" asked Dumbledore, looking towards him

"He's never hurt anyone before and Merlin knows he probably had the power to do so," Draco said, but reluctantly. "He's always been as real as he could be. I doubt this house would give him any added benefit."

"Give who benefit?" asked Ginny.

To Draco's right, the trunk lid flew off. Draco clenched his eyes shut and heard the collective gasp as his boggart sat up. At least Bill and Dumbledore had seen him before.

"Merlin, Malfoy," Ron breathed. "Is that-?"

"Yes," said Draco, his eyes still shut. "That's me."

"I most certainly am not!"

Draco opened his eyes and turned to face the damage. Lord Draco stood before him, dressed just as foppishly as before. This time it was a scarlet jacket with gold buttons and a matching gold brocade vest. The silk shirt underneath was blindingly white, an exact contrast to the black trousers. The boots were red-brown and with a riding heel to them. Draco actually remembered seeing Lord Draco wearing them before.

Lord Draco shrugged. "They're my favorite," he said, reading his thoughts like usual.

"You look like a Gryffindor," said Draco, displeased by the color choice.

"I look good in red," said Lord Draco. "Besides, I destroyed Hogwarts. No Gryffindor house left to contend with. Aren't you going to introduce me?"

Draco sighed and turned back to the group. "You already know Dumbledore and Bill."

"Bill!" Lord Draco exclaimed happily. He tripped over to the red-haired men, too high to walk a straight line, and then – Draco let out a pained breath – threw his arms around the eldest Weasley child. "I missed you. You've been dead for so long."

Bill's eyes were startled, but he gamely patted the boggart's thin shoulders.

"Glad I'm still here," said Bill.

Lord Draco pulled back. "I killed your son while your wife watched. I made you slit her throat. You weren't the same afterwards. I think you hated me."

Draco felt ill. He wanted to throw his boggart back in the trunk and let someone else deal with entertaining their fear. They should just risk it with the thunderstorm. Draco knew several good shielding charms, so what if they got a little singed by lightning?

Bill looked to Draco. "I probably would hate you after that," he said with a shrug.

Draco knew that Bill was affected by his boggart's words, but the forced nonchalance removed the knot in his stomach.

"I would certainly hope so," said Draco, not bothering to hide his grimace.

Lord Draco looked over to Dumbledore and the glazed eyes narrowed.

"Secrets, Headmaster?" he asked.

Dumbledore looked startled, eyes blinking briefly, but Lord Draco had already lost interest. He spun around and regarded Sirius.

"Sirius Black, the one who came back."

"Lord Draco," said Draco testily. "We've had enough rhymes for the day."

"Spoil my fun, tell me I'm done, don't bother to run," Lord Draco prattled in sing-song. He stopped and gave a sly smile. "For danger is already here."

There was meaning to those words, the clouds had cleared briefly and a moment of sanity emerged from the boggart. Lord Draco blinked and it was gone again.

"I'm Lord Draco," said the boggart, holding out his hand to Sirius. The man shook it warily; Lord Draco's grasp was limp.

"And the Terrific Trio," said Draco dryly. "Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Miss Hermione Granger."

"The Chosen One and Company," Lord Draco returned. "Hello." He gave a nod to the three and then smirked and Harry. "I'm afraid your best efforts were in vain."

"Stop gloating," Draco reprimanded. He looked over to Harry. "Apparently he rules the world now."

"Not the world just yet," Lord Draco confided to the boy-hero. "I'm having a bit of trouble with Canada, of all places. It's the damndest thing."

Lord Draco smirked again and then turned to the last of their group, Ginny. Draco took a step forward, just in case, but the response wasn't what he had expected. Lord Draco locked eyes with Ginny and stared. His face paled. Even his lips turned white. He turned wild eyes onto Draco.

"Why?" he demanded, crossing over to Draco and latching onto his coat. His voice was furious and rasping. "Why would you do this to us? Why would you bring her here? Did you want to torment me!" The last was shout and then Lord Draco shoved Draco back and stumbled a few steps away. Draco watched his boggarts' hands shake. A vial was pulled out of his jacket. The drugs were tossed back. It wasn't enough. He could see that.

He watched Lord Draco stagger over to the table and grab a bottle of wine. The boggart retreated once more, huddling in the corner across the room. He barely managed to get the cork out and bring the bottle to his lips.

"Well," said Draco, trying to remove all of the attention from his doppleganger, "the faster we drink the tea, the faster he can crawl back into his trunk."

He deliberately walked over to the table and sat, keeping his head down, not wanting to look anyone in the eye. He made no move to eat or drink though. He was sure his hands were trembling and he was feeling nauseous.

Bill took the chair to his right and Ginny at his left. He risked a glance and saw her staring at Lord Draco, an odd look on her face. The rest filtered into their chair as well, leaving the seat at the end of the table free. Lord Draco appeared to be chugging the wine.

Dumbledore poured the tea for everyone and then performed a few charms on it just to be sure.

"It appears to be safe," the Headmaster said. He looked over to the corner. "Lord Draco, you are welcome to join us."

Draco watched his boggart lower the bottle, studying them all with cold grey eyes. Then the smile was back, the half-crazed, forced smile.

"Of course, where are my manners?" asked Lord Draco. He walked to the table like he was crossing a ship in the middle of a storm, the wine bottle held tightly in his hand. He nearly sprawled on his face when he caught his feet together and laughed at himself. He dropped gracelessly into his seat and sent a smile at them all. "So, what brings you to this depleted mansion?"

Draco saw the way his boggart avoided looking in Ginny's direction. Lord Draco helped himself to a sandwich and then served Bill. He surveyed the table with mocking eyes when no one answered.

"Horcrux," Bill finally supplied.

"Ah, the last one," said Lord Draco. "The goblet, yes, that would make a worthy prize." He looked over to Dumbledore. "How does it feel, Headmaster? To be so close to the end, yet have it just out of reach?"

"We are dining with you," Dumbledore said evenly. "It is not so far."

"If you say so," said Lord Draco. He then looked to Hermione and Harry. He smiled. "I knew you two were going to get together. I could see it from first year. The idealist and the hero. So cute, so naïve, so… dead."

Harry looked to Draco, the question in his eyes.

"I killed you," Lord Draco supplied. "After bringing down the Order. Then, through a series of brilliant political moves, became Minister at the tender age of twenty-one after assassinating my predecessor, Percy Weasley. He was getting too suspicious."

Percy Weasley. That was a new name to add to his list. Draco saw Bill turn to him, but made no move to answer.

"After England, the world," said Lord Draco. He shrugged and fiddled with his silverware.

"So," said Ron, turning to Draco. "This is you off the deep-end?"

"I'm him living to his potential," Lord Draco answered. "But, they say that power corrupts, and I've never liked people telling me how I should behave, always second-guessing my every motive and preaching about morality and other such trivialities." He sent a sideways glance to Bill then picked up the bottle of wine again. He nearly sloshed half of it down his shirt because his efforts were uncoordinated and his hands were trembling.

"And you're afraid of him?" Ron asked, still looking at Draco.

The wrong thing to say. Draco heard some nervous titters and simply braced himself for whatever came next.

Lord Draco lowered the bottle, setting it down gently on the table.

"Afraid?" he asked, staring at the youngest Weasley son. His eyes were glassy and red-rimmed. His face was haggard and pale and his lips were chapped. Lord Draco laughed, a harsh, grating chortle that made Dumbledore across the table lower his hand to his lap. He was readying to pull his wand. He needn't have bothered. Lord Draco wasn't a physical threat. The worst dangers never were.

"When I tore apart the Order," said Lord Draco, in a low, deadly voice. "it wasn't through an attack. I hope you realize how easy it was, how precious little I had to do. People… people are like animals. They act in predictable ways if you understand their motivations. I started with you Ron."

Ron sat back, looking to Harry for support.

"Rather," said Lord Draco, "I started with you, and Harry, and Hermione. You see, the cracks in the foundation were already there. I just drove the wedge a little deeper." His lip curled. "Did you really think your trio could survive a couple?"

An awkward silence fell. Draco had wondered how well the friendships were maintained with regards to the relationship between Harry and Hermione. Apparently, not as well as it appeared, not if he, in some dark, troubled reality, had used that to split the entire Order.

"How does it feel, Hermione, to be wanted by two boys?" Lord Draco continued. "Don't worry. Lily Evans went through the same predicament."

Harry's head whipped around to Lord Draco at the mention of his mother's name.

"Lord Draco, stop it," Draco commanded.

His boggart looked over, a sneer twisting pale lips, the grey eyes lit with vicious pleasure.

"You picked me," he said. "You picked me because I was 'safe', because I posed no real physical threat to any of you. Did you really think that would prevent me from causing any other sort of damage?"

"We need the horcrux, Draco," said Harry. "We understand."

"He understands," Lord Draco mocked. "He doesn't, not really. It's in his blood to be the winner, to get the girl. He doesn't know what it's like to play second string. Isn't that right, Sirius?"

Oh, Merlin. Draco knew, of course, that Lily Evans had been a popular girl. He'd read about her, her and James Potter because it wasn't everyday a child was born who survived the Killing Curse. He needed to know everything he could about Harry Potter, including his parents. Most of the information he gathered from yearbooks and listening to his relatives talk. After all, most were Death Eaters, and Harry was a hot topic. Through that, he'd learned a lot about the past students of Hogwarts and he was a master at inference.

"You liked Lily too," Lord Draco told Sirius. "How could you not? She was influential at school, not afraid to speak her mind, and she was easy on the eyes."

Merde. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, wanting this to be over.

"Too bad she liked James more, but that never stopped you from wondering, did it? Just how would things have turned out if you'd been the one to make the first move? You think that too, don't you, Ron?"

And now Lord Draco turned back to the youngest Weasley boy, grinning maliciously.

"And Hermione, do you ever feel guilty for choosing one over the other? Lily had it harder, you know, she had three men to choose from. James, Sirius, and one Severus Snape, her childhood confidant."

Ron gaped. Hermione gasped and Harry stared. Sirius, his face redder than normal – from embarrassment and anger – simply looked away. Lily choosing James had been the deciding factor for Snape, Draco knew that much. He knew it wasn't really Lily's fault. Snape had been horrid, torn between the girl he loved and a place of belonging.

And that was enough. His boggart had no right to start dredging up secrets from those who weren't even present. Hell, he shouldn't even be attacking the others. It was his boggart, his responsibility. He could handle Lord Draco's taunts, the rest should be spared.

Draco turned to his boggart and let out a scathing laugh.

"Gossip, Lord Draco? Is that what you're reduced to?"

Lord Draco met his gaze and his lips curled, mirroring Draco's expression. They both held it for a few moments, then Lord Draco grinned.

"Challenging me, Draco?" He sat forward. "You know what I could tell them, don't you? All your nefarious plans, the thoughts you can't help but think, the way you imagine the world if you would only get your hands the slightest bit dirty. It isn't really murder, if it's for a good purpose, is it? Like Dear Aunt Bella. You were going to murder her."

"They know that," said Draco.

"And Bill," said Lord Draco. "You were going to wipe his memory at the end of sixth year, to protect your little secret."

"I didn't," said Draco.

"You were going to kill Tierney," said Lord Draco.

"Please," said Draco scornfully, "I was merely considering the benefits of assassination." He looked over at the rest of the table. "Purely last case scenario. All options had to be considered."

Lord Draco smiled. "Sometimes you're grateful your mother cursed you as a child, or else how many tears would you have shed when Lucius abandoned you for yet another business venture? You would have cried yourself to sleep every night. The lonely prince who had everything except his father's love."

Draco took a sip of his tea, trying to force casualness, trying to pretend that the words from his boggart's mouth meant nothing.

"Well, you didn't have Narcissa's love either, but she hardly counts. Always drunk. Usually high. She locked you in your rooms to keep you away, sometimes for days at a time. Rather similar to Potter here, except you had room to breathe. I wonder if the space you had makes a difference, or is the locked door all that matters? Of course, it was only his aunt who locked him away, not his own mother. You can bet his mother would have never slipped him Angel-Flight to keep him out of the way."

Draco refused to react to the words. He pulled up every mental shield and hid behind the walls where he could tend to his wounds without being seen.

"Does Bill know how easy it was for you to start caring for him? All he had to do was keep your secret, show a moment of camaraderie and you were ready to replace Lukas, your own brother. Lukas, the only one who ever truly, undeniably, cared for you.

"If Lucius had shown you any sort of undeniable affection, if he had ever said the words 'I love you', you would have taken the Dark Mark. You would have been his willing apprentice, worshiping his every move like poor, spineless Wormtail."

Draco stared at the tablecloth, his stomach churning again. His hands had curled into fists underneath the table.

"Maybe Lucius would have listened," said Lord Draco. "Maybe if you had just told him, showed him what you were, all that you were capable of, maybe that could have changed things. After all, he left you everything. He even reinstated you as his heir. But you kept your secrets. And then you killed him. We're not so different after all, are we Draco?"

There, something he could respond to. Draco looked up at his boggart, his lips quirking in a smirk. He looked over at the bottle of wine held in Lord Draco's hand and raised an eyebrow. He could see a big difference between them.

Lord Draco paled with anger, his grey eyes burning.

"Fils de pute," he spat.

Draco shrugged a shoulder. "No argument here."

Lord Draco's face went blank. Draco had never been one to cede an argument, so he knew Lord Draco wouldn't give up, not just yet. He waited, wondering what was next.

Lord Draco turned to face Ginny.

Draco took a breath, wondering what would come out of his mouth next. Would it be details of her death? How he had wooed the darkness in her soul, and when he couldn't turn her, when he couldn't extinguish all of her light, he had extinguished her instead.

"Ginny," said Lord Draco, his face twisted in anger. "Ginny."

But it was gentler that second time. Lord Draco's expression smoothed.

"My darling Ginevra," Lord Draco began again, trying to force nonchalance. He failed, badly, and then fell silent.

Draco looked over in surprise. He had been ready for a strike, ready to flinch and bleed as the true horrors of his mind were displayed for all to see. Now Lord Draco seemed to have lost his words. Instead he stared at Ginny, grey eyes drinking her in with an intensity that Draco guarded fiercely. He knew he looked at Ginny like this on occasion, but never with anyone else watching, much less Ginny herself.

"Ginny," said Lord Draco again. "Gorgeous Ginny. Funny Ginny. My Ginny."

Draco could see Ron turning an odd shade of red, ready to stand up and knock Lord Draco's head clean off his shoulders for saying such things. Bill was looking quite concerned too, but he was looking at the right culprit. He was looking at Draco. Ginny, however, simple gave a small smile.

"My Lord Draco," she returned.

And Lord Draco pushed his hand out on the table, reaching in her direction. It was a pale, thin, trembling hand and Ginny leaned closer, stretching past Draco to brush fingertips with his boggart.

"Ginny," said Lord Draco softly. "When he tells you, I don't know when he will, but when he finally admits that he loves you, he means every word."

Silence.

Draco blinked and stared at his boggart. Since when did boggarts actually say nice things? Since when did they stop leveling threats and dire consequences? Yes, Lord Draco had the ability to regret, but this was entirely different.

To the side, the door to the vanishing cabinet clicked open. No one moved though, they were too busy staring between Draco, Lord Draco, and Ginny. The latter two were only staring at each other and Ginny twisted her hand, so that she was holding onto Lord Draco's fingertips. Her expression was focused, intent, as if she was waiting for the boggart to realize something. Draco didn't think either of them were breathing.

Lord Draco suddenly reeled back in his chair.

"I didn't kill you!" he exclaimed. He turned to Draco, something akin to light forcing its way past muddled, glazed grey eyes. "How could I have?" he asked to only one who would understand. "How do you destroy salvation?"

"Well, I don't," said Draco. "But I rather thought that you, as the impersonation of my darkest fear, would have found the depravity to do so."

"Oh, sod off," Lord Draco exclaimed. "Where do you get off, dictating my every move? Why do I have to do the exact opposite of you every bloody time? You know what, if I want to do good someday, I will. I'd like to see you stop me!"

"By the wand of Merlin," Dumbledore whispered, staring at Lord Draco. "He's self-realized."

Draco looked from Dumbledore to Lord Draco in disbelief. Is that really what had happened? Had this manor lent his boggart enough power to take his fear one step further? Only it had backfired. Lord Draco had always been more real than any other boggart, simply because Draco was able to fear so vividly. Now, with this additional power, Lord Draco had embodied that realness and become, well, more human, with a separate, individual consciousness from Draco.

Draco Malfoy had always thought for himself, had rebelled against authority simply because he was smarter, more intelligent. He had never listened to his elders. If he had obeyed, it was simply because he agreed with their assessments or to further his own purpose. Lord Draco, with his own mind, would not be held to Draco's demands.

Draco stared at Lord Draco, amazed. A voice called his attention. It was the brownie.

"Did you have fun playing with your boggart, Draco?"

Draco's head snapped around at that tone. It was the tone, not the voice, that was so familiar. The voice was the brownie's, but the tone was sensual and scathing.

Draco pulled his wand and jumped to his feet. At the head of the table, Lord Draco mirrored his actions perfectly.

The brownie was contorting, growing. One leg ballooned, then an arm stretched, then the neck was lengthened. It was grotesque, but Draco couldn't look away. He knew who it would be.

"Avada Kedavra."

Green light shot from Lord Draco's wand to the twitching, morphing frame. The body fell but continued to transform into the seductive features of Claire Jameson.

"You killed her!" Ron yelped, jumping to his feet.

Several things happened at once. A dusty clock fell off the wall and a chair in the corner spasmed. The area rug on the floor rolled up and began to twist into a humanoid shape.

"Into the cabinet!" Draco commanded, pulling Ginny to her feet. The Order members scrambled from the table and made for the now unlocked door of the vanishing cabinet. One by one, they crammed inside and disappeared.

Draco waited for the others to enter, but Dumbledore motioned him ahead. He stepped into the cabinet, felt an odd tingling sensation, and then stepped out into another room. It was just as abandoned as the rest of the house, with dust and cobwebs covering every surface. Even the paintings and candelabras and vases that covered the long tables. Even the monstrous pile of galleons in the corner. Even the wooden trunks stacked three high alongside the windowless walls.

Draco turned as Lord Draco then Dumbledore appeared. Dumbledore immediately began casting wards on the cabinet and Draco joined him, adding a few complementary dark wards.

"What was that?" Ron demanded.

"Death Eaters," said Lord Draco. "They arrived yesterday but killed the brownie, thinking that would let them into the cabinet. When the door remained locked, Claire figured you would show up and finish the task. So she plotted an ambush."

"Thanks for telling us now," said Draco, rolling his eyes. He stepped back from the door, having cast enough to keep the Death Eaters at bay for now.

"Hey, I'm your boggart, not some Gryffindor do-good," Lord Draco snapped.

"Draco, Lord Draco, please," said Dumbledore. "We need a plan."

"Find the goblet, get out, run like hell," Harry supplied.

"I like it," said Draco.

"Clear, direct, I'm in," said Lord Draco. "Except, of course, the army of Death Eaters outside the door might hinder that. And, no, there isn't another way out."

Draco turned to survey the room, but Lord Draco was correct, as he expected him to be. They were in a safe room. The only way in was through the vanishing cabinet.

Draco looked over at his boggart and raised an eyebrow. Lord Draco stared back belligerently.

"Since when am I your errand boy?" he sneered.

"Since the fact that if I die, you die too," said Draco.

"I hate it when I'm smart," said Lord Draco. He sighed, affected a put-upon air, and walked over to the cabinet. He melted into a grey shadow and disappeared.

"What is he doing?" asked Bill.

"He'll buy us some time and provide a distraction," said Draco. "Now, let's find the goblet?"

ooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOoooo

There were benefits to being a boggart. Far more detriments, but a few benefits none the less. One of said benefits was the shadow-mist of the boggart's true form. It could move quickly and silently and remain largely unnoticed. It could even seep through a vanishing cabinet and right by a posse of Death Eaters without any of them noticing. Of course, the fact that the Death Eaters were in general chaos, cursing the door to the vanishing cabinet, contributed to his general invisibility.

Lord Draco regained his human shape outside of the room. He cursed the fact that his killing curse had done nothing more than a common 'stupefy'. It wasn't fair that he was the only one with the moral ambiguity to kill that bitch of a student teacher while she was defenseless and the only one who didn't have the magical power to do it.

Well, who said he had to use magic to kill Claire. Lord Draco paused for one moment, all of the possibilities flying through his sharp mind. Merlin, but he loved possessing the brain of Draco Malfoy.

He started down the hall again a moment later. It wasn't really his problem. He would seize the opportunity if it presented itself, but his first priority was getting the horcrux and getting the members of the Order out of Black Water. Ginny in particular.

Lord Draco walked downstairs, running his fingers along the wall. He was still a bit unsteady on his feet. The Angel-Flight, while not real in a chemical sense, was still a little hard to shake.

He paused again as he felt the wall brush back against his fingertips. He tilted his head to the side and pressed his hand flat against the wall.

Voices sounded in his head, murmuring and whispering, and he felt invisible hands touch his mind. Incredible. The house was…well, not sentient. But through the house he could connect with the other magical creatures who lived within the wards. Creatures that no normal human would be able to contact, much less understand and communicate with, but then again, Lord Draco wasn't exactly normal.

A predatory smile pulled at his lips. Really, the creatures weren't terribly harmful, but he was Lord Draco. If he could take over the world, then he could run a few Death Eaters out of his house.

ooooOOOOOooooOOOOoooOOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOoooo

Again, I apologize for the delay. Please leave a review. Also, the French that Lord Draco uses means 'son of a bitch'; hence, Draco doesn't try to contradict him.





34. The Death of Fear

Author's note: Apologies for waiting so long (cough – years) for this piece of fanfic to resume. Needless to say, I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would have editors and agents and publicists that would probably sit on me until I finished the work, and I'm pretty sure, if someone was sitting on me, I'd get it done a whole lot faster.

ALSO! Important! Please check out my story 'In the Absence of Fear' – which is a Lord Draco origin story, and while not vital to understanding this chapter, it will clue you in on a few things.

OoOoO

Draco let out a breath as Lord Draco dissipated and drifted underneath the edge of the door. It was a relief, having him gone. He felt exposed with his doppelganger standing beside him, and Lord Draco's recent actions had left him reeling. He himself didn't know what to make of it, didn't know how to react, and here everyone was present to watch him fumble and hesitate. So the breath was really more of a sigh of relief, the only moment of self-indulgence he allowed himself.

He turned, meeting Harry and Ginny's eyes, pushing all emotion and distraction away. They were trapped in a haunted house, hiding out in a vault with a horcrux to find, Death Eaters to defeat, and an escape to make.

"You're up," he told them. "Find the goblet."

But the room wasn't that large, maybe slightly larger than his study, so everyone split up, claiming a table or a chest to rummage through. Draco honestly doubted that Harry or Ginny would find it any faster that those unconnected to Voldemort's tarnished soul.

He stepped to one of the tables. The collection of stolen goods was quite impressive, and he could pick out a few famous pieces – the painting of Merlin by Atricia Bell, a diadem that was supposed to have belonged to Aldo the Great, and a whole chest of what looked like old goblin coins, before the galleon came into circulation. No goblet here though. He turned.

Harry was walking around the room, his hands outstretched, like he thought he might be drawn to the horcrux. Ginny closed her eyes for a moment in consideration, then opened, frowned, and turned to Draco.

"Aren't I supposed to feel something?"

"In theory, yes."

Ginny closed her eyes again and her nose wrinkled with the effort of reaching out, feeling for a dark aura.

"Got it!" Hermione called.

Everyone looked over. Hermione was holding up a large, golden goblet with the Hufflepuff crest on the side.

"That's it?" Ginny asked.

"Lemme see!" said Ron.

The goblet was passed to Dumbledore first for confirmation.

"It is Helga's goblet," said the Headmaster.

Ginny tapped Draco's shoulder, and he turned, raising an eyebrow at her.

"I don't think I feel it," she whispered. She seemed troubled by the fact.

"You're probably so used to suppressing that part of your mind that you're suppressing the connection as well," said Draco. "I wouldn't worry."

But this was Ginny, and so he wasn't surprised to see her stare at the goblet, visibly willing herself to feel the connection.

The goblet was passed to Ron and then Harry.

"Can we destroy it now?" he asked Dumbledore.

"No," said Dumbledore, shaking his head. "We don't have the time, and destroying a horcrux is a tiring business. And having it with us when we escape will make Voldemort a little cautious, not wanting to damage it. Best to take it with us."

Draco agreed, and glanced to the door, wondering when Lord Draco would get back so they could start finalizing an escape route.

"I think I feel it now," said Ginny, opening her eyes and staring at the goblet. "It feels…alive, and a little slimy."

Draco's lips twitched at her description. Harry tossed the goblet to Sirius, making Hermione fret about how to handle a horcrux.

"And I lost it," said Ginny, giving a sigh.

"You're upset about it," said Draco, not understanding why.

"I just…I wanted something good to come out of having been possessed by him," said Ginny.

Her comment was innocent, but it struck a nerve. Draco quickly glanced away, but Ginny caught his hand.

"Don't think that," she said.

"Think what?"

"You are the best thing that came from being possessed by Voldemort," she said.

"I'd rather you weren't possessed by him at all," said Draco icily, trying to pull away.

"Hey, stop that," she said, grabbing his hand again. "I know you feel that way, I know you'd go back and change it if you could."

"I'll get a time-turner," said Draco.

Ginny laughed. "You can't change the past."

"I have a theory that you can."

"I wouldn't want you to. You're not some consolation prize because I went through what I did. It happened, and it's a part of me, and it just put me on track with you, that's all. That's life."

"A hard life," Draco muttered.

"Shush," said Ginny. "If me going through that possession gave you someone that you can talk to, someone that you…that you can care for," and she was blushing now, "then I'm glad that it happened to me. I'm glad that I'm a little stained."

"You're not stained," said Draco. "And that part of him in you isn't why I…," but the words 'I love you' were foreign to him, so he changed them, "that's not why you fascinate me. It's that you survived, how you overcame and how it made you stronger. It's always been you."

Grey mist sunk under the door and Lord Draco solidified with a twisted look on his face. "I don't do mushy," he informed Draco archly. "Please refrain while you are in my premise."

Ginny laughed, because of course she'd laugh at the worst part of him. Lord Draco winced. "Darling, I'm a Boggart. Laughing isn't the best way to treat your best way of escape."

"Sorry," said Ginny, still smiling. Lord Draco gave her a dark look.

"What's the situation like?" asked Bill.

"Dismal and bleak," said Lord Draco. "But that's alright. You have two of me now, and Dumbledore's not that bad either."

"I appreciate the compliment," said Dumbledore.

"The plan, Lord Draco," said Draco, ready to leave this house.

"Right," said Lord Draco. "I'm providing a distraction in -," he pulled out a pocket watch, "very soon."

"Will it be enough?" asked Draco.

"Of course not," said Lord Draco. "Do you know how many Death Eaters are up there? Do you know how powerful Voldemort has become?"

"Then what good will the distraction do?" Bill asked.

"It'll let us move the cabinet," said Draco.

Lord Draco nodded. "One or two people will step out. The distraction will be enough for you to Apparate immediately, taking the cabinet with you so that the rest of you can leave into an empty room and from there, out of the house."

"Why can't you Apparate the cabinet out of the house?" Harry asked.

"Vanishing cabinets are usually bound by perimeters," Hermione said. "If we go too far-,"

"It wouldn't be pretty," Lord Draco agreed. "And I can't be one to help move the cabinet. Apparently all the magic I can conjure is a brief blast of formless energy." He scowled, looking quite perturbed. "I really wanted to kill that blonde trollop."

"You're a Boggart," said Dumbledore. "It's incredible you can do that much."

Lord Draco tipped his hand back and forth. "That's debatable."

Draco shot a look his way. What was debatable? That he was a Boggart or that his power was incredible?

Lord Draco tossed him a wink and then clapped his hands, calling the rest of the room into order. "Who wants to volunteer to risk their lives moving furniture?"

"I'm going," said Draco immediately.

"I don't think-," Dumbledore began, but Bill interrupted.

"Draco and I go."

Draco turned to Bill, surprised and pleased that the ex-professor was on his side.

"It makes the most sense," said Bill. "Draco is the best to duel with dark magic, and I'll be able to move the cabinet no problem. I used to be a curse breaker, so I've experience transporting fragile magical objects."

Dumbledore nodded, seeing his reasoning. "Then I go first, with Lord Draco."

Draco raised an eyebrow.

"Voldemort will be there," said Dumbledore. "If Lord Draco and I go out together, he will follow us."

Yes, Draco could see how that would be very attractive bait. He nodded.

"I can bring along a few surprises," said Lord Draco, grinning madly.

Draco shot him a look. "Do I want to know the surprises?"

"They wouldn't be surprises if I told you. I suppose you're all looking on getting out of here. Front entrance, then?"

"If Voldemort takes the bait, then yes," said Bill.

"It's the closest to civilization," said Sirius.

"We can't lead a group of Death Eaters into a crowd of innocent people," said Hermione. "There would be mass casualties."

"Not likely. A lot of people that live here are fugitives from the law. They'd be handy in a fight," said Draco.

"And if we can't get out that way?" Harry asked.

"Third floor," said Draco. "They won't expect us to go up." He looked to Lord Draco and raised an eyebrow. His boggart sighed, endlessly long-suffering.

"What else do you want me to do?" he asked. "Choreograph a dance number?"

"What's the idea?" asked Harry.

"Hopefully something we won't have to use," said Draco. "Anyone have questions?"

"Too many," said Ron darkly.

Dumbledore nodded. "Everyone, be on your guard."

Lord Draco rolled his eyes. "Predictable."

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Don't have too much fun," he said to both Dracos.

"Much better," said Lord Draco. He turned to Dumbledore. "Shall we?" He phased into missed and slipped back under the door.

"Give us ten," said Dumbledore, and then he lowered the wards and burst through the door. Draco got a glimpse of the room. It was full of Death Eaters, twenty at the least. He and Bill immediately pulled the door shut again.

"Ten what?" asked Bill. "Minutes?"

"Seconds, I should think," said Draco. "You ready?"

"Well, I guess I have to be now," said Bill.

Draco tightened his grip on his wand. They burst through the cabinet and into chaos.

The room was filled with smoke and bright flashes of magic. Death Eaters were screaming. There were a good deal of giant spiders and enormous snakes and one humongous brown bear was tearing through the room. Boggarts, obviously. A lot of them. Also a few poltergeists and a couple of brownies.

Lord Draco spun about in the middle of the room, hands outstretched like a conductor. He was controlling them. Draco tore his eyes away from the madness. He and Bill each placed a hand on the cabinet.

"On three," said Bill.

A blinding flash of light enveloped the room. Draco felt something plow into his chest and send him backwards. He hit the wall and couldn't quite find his feet again. He lay, half slumped on the floor, and blinked rapidly, trying to force the spots from his vision. The cabinet and Bill were gone. Voldemort stood in front of him, pale face snarling.

"Did you think you would win?"

"Well, it's looking good so far," said Lord Draco to his side.

Voldemort spun. Lord Draco had changed from his usual gaudy clothes to an outfit just like Draco's, the same dark coat, the same black boots. He had the same hair, slightly ruffled from the fight, and the same steady, smug expression that had become Draco's resting face.

"Come and get me," said Lord Draco. He raised his wand and blinked out of the room and into the hall.

It was enough of a distraction for Draco to grab his own wand and Apparate down into the ground floor. There were Death Eaters here as well, mostly involved in fighting the various dark apparitions of the house, but they were only too happy to fling curses in Draco's direction as well.

Draco blocked them, or dodged them. He wasn't interested in fighting, just in escaping. He ran out of the front parlor and saw Bill in the hall, the cabinet wedged in the floor, preventing the door from opening. Bill hadn't realized Draco was gone before Apparating, and without the additional support, the cabinet had splinched into the floor.

A press of Death Eaters had surrounded him from both sides. Bill was doing an admirable job of shielding from all the dark curses sent his way, but it was obvious he wouldn't be able to hold them off on his own. Draco immediately sent out a blast of energy to sweep back the ones coming in from the rear.

"You alright?" Bill called over the noise of battle.

"Fine!" Draco grabbed the other side of the cabinet and together they pulled it up to rest on the floor, not halfway in it.

Another swoop of Death Eaters came from behind. They needed to get out of the hall. Draco lay down a set of shield charms.

"Parlor," said Bill, and Draco nodded. They Apparated again, the cabinet in between them. They appeared in the front parlor, a dim, over-decorated room stuffed full of furniture. The door was closed, but it was immediately barraged with curses from the outside. The Death Eaters knew where they were.

Bill shielded the doorway. Draco surveyed the room, not liking how full it was. Too many opportunities to trigger a trap or wake a ghost. Still, it would have to do. He opened the cabinet and let the others out. "Just don't touch anything."

He moved to the doorway with Bill. The shields were holding for now. Draco cast a quick transparency charm. There were five Death Eaters blocking their way, but the front entrance was in sight.

"We can make it," said Bill.

A flash of smoke appeared in the hall, and then Dumbledore stepped out. He was quick to engage the Death Eaters. Bill and Draco exchanged a glance. Draco nodded; this was their chance. Bill threw the door open. "Go!"

Sirius led the others out of the parlor, Draco and Bill hanging back to bring up the rear. Someone had organized them into pairs, which was smart. Probably Hermione then. Dumbledore cleared the way to the front door, and then took up a guard position. Sirius was the first to reach the door.

Draco didn't see him turn the knob – he was too busy battle a Death Eater that had come from behind – but he did hear the high pinging noise. He whipped around, trusting Bill to have his back, and shouted a warning, but it came too late.

The door exploded inwards – but it wasn't just the door, it was the entire front wall. A messy, but effective trap. Sirius was flung across the hall from the force of the explosion. Ron and Ginny were knocked off their feet – and still the wall was falling.

Draco sent up a shield charm– as did Dumbledore and Bill. The shield held, but creaked alarmingly. Draco whipped back around to stop a curse from a Death Eater. They were pinned down at the entrance, Death Eaters attacking from the hall also from above on the stairs. They needed to leave. The front entrance was completely blocked off.

He sent out a flurry of spells, one to light the stairs on fire, one that sent out a gust of wind, another to knock out the eardrums of the Death Eaters and ruin their sense of equilibrium, and a last one to cover his group in a silencing spell.

He turned to the others. Ron and Ginny were back on their feet. His eyes stayed a second more on Ginny than on Ron. Dumbledore was helping Sirius up, he looked unsteady. Harry and Hermione were fine.

"Third floor," he told them. "Give me twenty seconds before following."

He Apparated. The third floor hall was dark and gloomy and mostly empty. There was only one Death Eater, and he was still cowering from his boggart, a brown bear. Draco stupefied him, just because the bear was a little distracting. The boggart slipped back into wisp-form with a put-out sounding sigh, but didn't morph into Lord Draco, like Draco had half-expected. The boggart slunk away.

Draco cast about for any further treats – but the third floor was quiet. Far too quiet.

A trap.

The others appeared before he could go back down to warn them.

"Where to now?" Bill asked.

That was when Voldemort Apparated into the hall, cutting them off from the stairs. "Leaving so soon?"

More pops! of Apparation sounded behind them. Draco whipped around – more Death Eaters – half a dozen, catching them in a pincer move.

"You could just give me the horcrux," said Voldemort, tauntingly, and then he laughed. "But it's far more satisfying to pry it from your dead hands." He lashed out with his wand and white lightning shot forth. Draco jumped forward with a shield that was echoed by Dumbledore, and still their shield faltered and nearly shattered. He could hear Bill yelling behind him, more curses being thrown by the others and the Death Eaters – but Voldemort was the main threat.

Draco quickly Apparated behind Voldemort, so that he and Dumbledore could attack from two sides, to split Voldemort's attention. He threw himself into the battle, and across from him, Dumbledore did the same.

Dumbledore's spells were strong and fast. Draco's were deadly and dark. Voldemort blocked every single one of them, and sent out even more. His were strong and dark, fast and deadly. Draco knew they might be able to keep Voldemort's attention for the time being, but they wouldn't be able to defeat him. His spells were too strong. A flash of fire seared the side of his face when he was a split second too late with a shield. He responded with the Cruciatus curse, just because he knew it would catch Voldemort's attention. It did, Dumbledore took advantage to lash out with his own curse – not as dark – and while Voldemort was distracted, Draco risked a glance down the hall. Bill was herding the others into a room. The Death Eaters were down to two.

A blast of cold threw him off his feet. Draco tumbled back – startled – because that hadn't even been a curse. Voldemort was still casting his own cruciatus at Dumbledore, which was deflected. So how had he - ?

Draco put the pieces together. Voldemort was casting wandlessly now, and showing limited control of the weather. The power was unheard of – only rumored that Merlin himself had possessed such ability. It was terrifying.

Voldemort whirled on him, a wicked smile over his face, and Draco didn't bother to attack. What would be the point against that sort of power? For that matter, what good would a warded room be?

But one problem at a time. Draco Apparated past Voldemort. He knew the value of a strategic retreat, and from the way Dumbledore followed him, he knew it too. Bill was at the door of the room, all other Order members inside. It was only half a hall away, but with Voldemort flinging curses at them, it may have as well been a mile.

But then Lord Draco appeared from the end of the hall, running full tilt towards Voldemort, but it wasn't the Lord Draco he was used to seeing. This Lord Draco looked older than him by a few years. He was dressed in all black, velvet and soft suede. His eyes were shadowed and dark and there was a hard edge to him that was usually covered with drugs.

He was leading a charge of brownies, poltergeists, and ghosts. They swarmed down the hall, brushing past Draco and Dumbledore. They swarmed up and over Voldemort – and they weren't a threat, not really, at most they were a nuisance, but then Draco saw what they were doing. They were bringing the whole house down under their feet.

"Merde!" The curse escaped him. Draco put on a burst of speed. He could hear Voldemort yell in outrage. He risked a glance back to see Voldemort fighting through the mass of supernatural creatures, shaking them off like drops of water, but the floor was still caving beneath his feet, and the walls were shaking, ready to tumble. But Voldemort still locked eyes on him, still lowered his wand, and Avada–green shot out, straight at Draco.

Something hit him from behind, throwing him into the room, and then the door was slamming shut. Draco hit the ground and hurriedly rolled over, afraid for a moment that it had been Dumbledore who had taken the curse for him. But the Headmaster was on his feet, quickly throwing up charms to protect the room from the destruction that was occurring all around it.

The crumbling house only felt like a rumble around them.

Draco sat up and finally saw who had saved him, or rather, what. Lord Draco was on the floor beside him. There was a gaping hole in his chest.

OoOoOoO

Ginny held onto Lord Draco.

She didn't know why she had gone to Lord Draco first. Maybe because it was obvious he was dying. Maybe it was because Draco had scrambled to his feet as soon as he saw his dying boggart and retreated to help Dumbledore with the wards, clearly distancing himself.

Lord Draco was trembling, blood flecking from his lips with his harsh breaths. Her hand was still pressed on his chest, practically in his chest the wound was so large. She tried not to think about it, but her hand was hot and slick and every time his heart beat, more liquid pumped forth.

"You'll be okay," she told him, fastening her eyes onto his. She didn't believe that, and knew that he didn't, but wasn't that what people said in this situation?

Pale lips stained scarlet twitched up. Silver eyes sparked, but only for a moment. "My funny Ginny," the lips formed, the words faint, more of an exhale than actual speech.

She forced herself to smile back, but it slipped as his body suddenly seized, muscles locking, and he gave a short cry, then smashed his mouth shut.

It was funny how life-like he was. She knew he was a boggart, knew he was nothing more than a manifestation of Draco's worst fears, and yet he had independent thought and autonomous action. He'd become something more. Something close to human.

"Shh," she whispered, brushing his hair back from his face. It was damp with sweat, even though he shivered.

He slumped, muscles losing their tension. His heart was slowing. The wound was still bleeding, but it was more of a drain now, not pumping forth. His eyes locked onto hers again, like she was the only thing in the world right now, like it didn't even matter he was dying. He blinked once, long and slow, so slow, she thought he passed on right then, but his eyes opened once more.

She gently wiped the blood off of his lips with the edge of her scarf. She leaned over him and pressed her lips to his cold ones. Just once, just lightly. When she pulled back, he was smiling.

"Told you," he whispered, his eyes shining with some inner triumph. He'd won some hidden, unknown victory, and from the light in his eyes, he'd just won the world. He sucked in a shuddering breath, and released it smoothly. His eyes lost focus. He didn't inhale again.

Ginny held him for a minute more, and then his body disintegrated into a cool, grey mist and disappeared. She was left, sitting on the floor, all traces of blood gone. All trace of him gone.

She wanted to cry. Her eyes stung, and she was angry at herself, because she knew it wasn't him, it wasn't Draco, not the Draco she knew, but at the same time, he was a part of Draco. He was a facet of Draco that no one had seen before, one that had been forced to the deepest corners of Draco's mind, and no one knew that he even existed. He had been lost, purposefully, but still lost and now, right after he had blinded them all with his brilliance, with his true potential, he was lost again. For good.

She sniffed and blinked rapidly. She was not going to cry, damn it.

"Ginny," said Bill.

Ginny pushed herself to her feet, feeling pins and needles in her legs and back. She walked over to the window and looked out.

"He's not dead."

Draco's voice had everyone turning, even Ginny. She looked at her boyfriend. Draco glanced down at the floor, one booted foot scuffing the ground once. That wasn't like him, to show his discomfort so visibly, but then again, he'd already been exposed with the arrival of Lord Draco.

Draco looked up at Ginny. His eyes were darker than Lord Draco's, that was one reason Ginny wanted to cry at the boggart's death. Lord Draco had loved her, openly and unashamedly. There was no hesitation, no fear.

Draco hadn't reached that level yet. It was all well and good for a boggart to proclaim his love, but Draco was a person. All of the disappointments and tragedies he had suffered were more real to him than to Lord Draco. Lord Draco was just a piece of Draco. He couldn't feel everything to the same extent.

"He's a boggart," said Draco, holding her gaze. "I could find another one, anytime you wanted to talk to him. I don't know if he'd be himself, outside of this domain, but you could still say hello, if you wanted."

She crossed over to him and put her arms around his neck.

"I don't want to talk to him," she said. "I want to talk to you."

And it was true. She cared little for a boggart when there was the real thing standing in front of her. She smiled at him.

Draco frowned back. "What?"

She smiled wider. "Nothing. Can't I smile at you?"

"Sure you can," said Draco. "It's just we're stuck in a haunted house that's falling to pieces around us and we still have to get out of here with the Horcrux before Voldemort recovers. Just seemed like an odd time to smile."

"You're inwardly smiling," she told him, knowing it to be true.

Draco smirked, an unholy light in his eyes. "Maybe." He reached out to tug at her hand. "Thank you," he said quietly. "For staying with him."

"I wouldn't be anywhere else." Even if he was just a piece of Draco, he'd still needed her. And she wouldn't deny even a piece of Draco any bit of love. "So, how are we getting out of here?"

Draco turned to the room, his eyes swept over furniture, and then lighted on a cabinet. He crossed over and pulled it open. A stack of brooms had been placed inside.

"We fly."

OoOoOoO

Thanks for sticking with me! I promise not to vanish for years again. I'm hoping for an update every-other-week. We'll see what happens. Also. Huh. This came out a little shorter than my usual chapters...

Also also – if you didn't read my author's note in the beginning of the chapter, which said to check out 'In the Absence of Fear,' you might be a little confused. So go check out Lord Draco's origin story.





35. Tornados and Dragons

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I think I'd buy my own bookstore, with a cafe, so that I could live there, read whatever I wanted, and drink unhealthy amounts of lattes.

Author's note: Whoops. More of three weeks than two weeks. Ugh. Time constraints. My bad. Please enjoy.

OoOoOo

"Are you sure this is a good idea?"

Draco glanced over at Bill, and then back to the window. The house had stopped shaking beneath their feet. The army of ghosts and brownies and poltergeists had finished their assault – or rather, Voldemort had regrouped his Death Eaters and launched a successful counter-attack. Now the walls were shaking. The Death Eaters were trying to get it. The wards that Draco, Dumbledore, and Bill had set wouldn't last for long.

"It's our best chance," said Draco, even though he knew it was risky. He hefted his broom over his shoulder and turned to the room. "Any last questions?"

There were a few grim shakes of the head. Draco narrowed his eyes. Hermione looked nervous – she wasn't a strong flyer, obviously the weakest of the bunch. Actually – Draco had never seen Dumbledore fly. He was simply assuming the Headmaster knew how and was good at it. Draco frowned a moment. He didn't like making assumptions.

The Headmaster stepped forward and handed out the Portkeys, two to each person, made from the objects collected from the room. Draco got two inkwells. He slipped them into his pocket. "Alright then, Potter, let's go."

They weren't grouped the way Draco had intended. In Draco's plan – well, it didn't matter now. Dumbledore had made his suggestions, over Draco's protests, and the rest of the Order members seemed to agree with the Headmaster. Draco didn't know if it was because Dumbledore had genuinely made better arguments, or the Order trusted him more, or if it was some blind Gryffindor loyalty.

Harry stepped up beside him, the horcrux tied to his belt. Draco would have preferred to shrink the goblet down, but the goblet was resistant to the usual charms. Draco didn't know if that was due to the bit of black soul inside of it, or if it was due to the original make of the goblet, tamper-proofed from spells and magic.

"Be careful," Bill said.

Draco nodded. "Always."

Sirius pulled the window open. There were Death Eaters outside the house now. They saw the movement. Sirius sent out a nice cover of curses – quite a few of them of the dark variety, which had Draco giving him a nod of approval, and then he mounted his broom and took off through the window.

The broom was old. It had the obnoxious vibration of the older models of brooms, and it bucked slightly underneath him. But it was powerful. Draco cast a few blasting hexes at the Death Eaters below, and then motioned for Potter to join him. They climbed high into the air, away from the reach of any spells. Draco turned to Harry.

"Let's go then."

They sped off to the east.

It was a game of divide and conquer. Split the Death Eaters off, hopefully lose them among the clouds – or curse them into submission if necessary, and then regroup to make their escape.

The air was cold, very cold. Draco had charmed his coat, hat, and gloves the best he could to be impervious to the wind, but there was only so much the charms could do against the elevation and weather. He shivered and his eyes stung in the wind, but produced no tears. How he wished for a pair of goggles.

He turned to see how Harry was doing. The boy-hero looked similarly cold, but also determined. He had better control of his broom than Draco had. Oh, to be so casually talented at flying. Draco felt a little prick of envy, a familiar feeling.

As if sensing his gaze, Harry looked up at him. "I thought you said they'd follow us!" he yelled over the wind.

His words must have conjured up the Death Eaters. No sooner had Draco just thought that Harry had jinxed them, a shot of a red-stunning curse fizzled out below their brooms.

Draco turned. There were three Death Eaters following them. Two were on a magic carpet. The other on a broom.

"You just had to say it," he yelled back at Harry. And then he Apparated.

It was stupid, but very rarely did wizards and witches realize that they could Apparate while flying. Draco wondered if it was because it was illegal in Quidditch that no one seemed to realize that Apparating while on a broom was an even faster way of travelling. And, quite easy. There was a whole sky to appear in, and very little risk of splinching into anything, unlike on the ground where there were people and buildings and pavement all around.

He appeared behind the Death Eaters, sent out three stunners, and took out the whole lot in two seconds flat. Harry pulled up and waited for Draco to catch up. "How do you think the others are doing?"

Draco shrugged. "Hard to say."

"You said Voldemort would expect a diversion – so that he wouldn't bother with the first ones out."

"I said that the Dark Lord would expect a diversion, but also that he could sense his horcrux," Draco corrected. "He'll quickly realize that the other groups are the distraction and come back for us. That's why we should keep moving. Get as much distance as possible, make it harder for him to sense the cup."

Harry nodded, and they sped off again.

It was true that Voldemort wouldn't expect the first group out to have the Horcrux. It was also true that, in retaliation, he might do as much damage as he could to the others in anger. Draco didn't share that piece with Harry. That's why Draco didn't want to be one of the first ones out the window – he was one of the strongest duelers. He should be used for the fight, not the diversion.

It was also curious that Dumbledore had insisted that Harry carry the horcrux. Voldemort didn't need any more incentive to go after Potter. It was little like double-stuffing the bait.

Something small and irritating scratched in the back of his mind. Draco was missing something. He tried to identify what it was that itched at him so, but his thoughts kept evaporating as soon as he tried to grasp them.

"Malfoy! Come on!"

Draco looked up. He'd fallen behind – lost in his thoughts. He swore under his breath and shook his head to refocus. He put on a burst of speed, the boom bucking just a little, and caught up with Harry.

Harry moved his broom closer, so that they were flying within arm's reach of each other. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing," said Draco.

"Is that why you nearly stopped flying?" Harry challenged.

"It's a problem for another day. When we aren't being chased by Death Eaters."

Harry looked at him suspiciously, but said nothing more. He drifted down and out a little. The brooms were a little too unstable to fly so close to each other for long. One big jerk and they'd both go tumbling.

The clouds were thicker up ahead. The moisture made the air seem even colder. The skin exposed to the wind – his face and neck – felt like it was beginning to freeze. The cold seemed to seep into his brain as well, like a cold headache from a too-large mouthful of ice cream.

Draco was just beginning to think they should duck lower when a shadow seemed to flit inside the cloud ahead. Draco immediately pulled up. Harry did as well – which meant he'd seen it too.

"What is -," Harry started, and then the shadow grew larger, closer, and the form became clearer.

"Oh, merde," Draco swore. "Potter – go, go, go!" He turned his broom – but not fast enough to avoid the terrifying sight of a Chinese Fireball dragon emerging out of a cloud, fire shooting from its nostrils.

The dragon fire spread out – and suddenly it wasn't so cold. It was hot. Far too hot for comfort.

Draco dove his broom down. He glanced over, to see Potter doing the same.

"What now?" Harry yelled at him, over the screech of the dragon.

"Fly faster!" Draco yelled back.

They split off from each other, Harry breaking left, and Draco right. The dragon dove for Harry. Draco followed it at a distance, wand out and ready. He couldn't stop a dragon – at least, his brain was whirling with possibilities but none had a chance of succeeding. At the very least, he may be able to throw a fire-ward over Harry if it looked like he might be roasted alive.

Where had the Death Eaters gotten the dragon?

But that was a distracting thought as well, and not conducive to his and Harry's health at the moment. He needed to stay focused.

Potter was doing an admirable job dodging though. Draco didn't know why he was so surprised, after all, Potter had gone up against a dragon in their fourth year and done just fine. This was probably old hat to him.

And then two more Death Eaters came in from the clouds, wands out, and curses flying. Draco saw them first, because he wasn't flying for his life from a very angry dragon. Chinese Fireballs did not like the cold.

He tried yelling out a warning, but his voice was lost in the wind. He shot a stunner at one of the Death Eaters, and a gust of wind at the other. Both were deflected. A curse was sent his way, he dropped under it, and then Apparated. He appeared behind one of the Death Eaters and cast a fire-lash. The Death Eater turned and blocked it, and then pulled up short.

Draco desperately tried to stop his broom, but it was far too old and rickety. He crashed into the Death Eater – which the Death Eater had been expecting. The Death Eater grabbed at him and nearly yanked him off the broom. Draco struggled to remain seated; struggled to get the hands off of him. The Death Eater was far bigger and far stronger. An elbow connected with his face, catching the corner of his temple. Lights burst in his vision. The hands shoved him back and yanked the broom out from under him.

Draco fell.

For one split second, he flashed back to his sixth year, and that horrible fall in Quidditch, and then his brain clicked past the immediate fear, and he flicked out his wand. "Accio, broom."

The Death Eater had already turned away from him, sure that Draco was no longer a threat. Imbecile. Draco was falling, but far from defenseless. He could see the broom break free from the Death Eater's hand and shoot towards Draco.

But Draco was falling too fast. He pointed his wand at the ground that was rushing up towards him. Hover charms were useless at the speed he was falling. "Ventas. Ventas," he chanted instead, creating a back draft of wind that slowed his descent. The broom zoomed closer. Draco grabbed it, and pulled himself back up and on it.

The inkwell in his pocket buzzed, a warning.

Draco urged his broom up to where Potter was dodging both the dragon and the two Death Eaters. Thankfully, dragons were impossible to control. Draco had no doubt that the Death Eaters had used targeting spells on the dragon to encourage it to chase after Potter and himself, but they weren't foolproof. The dragon would go for anything that flew into its sights. Harry had figured that out. He was flying as close to the dragon as possible, drawing the Death Eaters in close as well. The spells that the Death Eaters were using hit the dragon, not Harry. It made the dragon angry. It burst out fire again – getting one of the Death Eaters, who fell back, screaming.

Draco reached the dragon, ducked under its clawed talon, and shot a hex at the remaining Death Eater – a blinding hex. It hit. The Death Eater screamed, floundered, and then the dragon snapped its jaws.

The Death Eater screamed once, and Draco dropped back. He had no desire to see a dragon eat a person. Harry pulled up beside him. He was faintly scorched from dragon-fire, but otherwise whole.

"It's almost time," said Draco.

"You have a weird look in your eye," said Harry.

"Voldemort isn't here," said Draco.

"He should have come after the horcrux," Harry agreed.

"But he didn't, which means he must know we planned on all meeting back up." Draco glanced back at the dragon. "He's expecting us all to meet back up. He's not expecting a dragon."

"Oh, no," said Harry.

"Yes," said Draco. "We've both got a Portkey. Only one of us needs to be holding onto the dragon."

"This is insane," said Harry.

"Yes," said Draco. And then he grinned, and turned to the boy-hero. "But it's a little bit fun, don't you think?"

The Portkey in his pocket buzzed again, thirty seconds. Draco shot forward, straight for the dragon, which had just finished its Death Eater meal and was now licking its chops.

He heard Harry whoop from behind him, obviously coming around to his point of view. When else would they ever get a chance to Portkey a dragon mid-flight?

It's not easy to catch a dragon in the air, much less get a good enough hold on one for a Portkey to take effect. But Draco wasn't going to be daunted by difficulties. His mind was already working at the best possible place to hold onto – the tail, if he could manage it, on one of the spikes. The spikes were bone – no nerve receptors. If a dragon were well enough distracted, it wouldn't notice Draco.

"Distract him!" he yelled at Harry.

"What do you think I've been doing this whole time?" Harry yelled back, his tone indignant. Draco couldn't help but smirk.

And distract it Potter did. Potter weaved and dodged and dropped and soared, and the dragon was hard pressed to keep up with him. Draco was hard pressed to keep up with the dragon. The tail whipped back and forth as the dragon flew, a powerful limb of scale, muscle, and bone. The spikes were dangerous and sharp. Draco's first grab missed and the spike clipped his arm, tearing his coat and the flesh underneath.

Draco hissed in a breath, but the icy wind immediately numbed the hot pain.

"Do you have him yet?" Harry yelled at him, narrowly missing a snort of fire.

Draco grabbed a second time. His hand closed around the spike. The tail whipped to the side, and Draco was flung with it, barely managing to hold onto his broom with his legs. He reached into his pocket for the buzzing inkwell, pulled it out, and pressed it to the dragon's tail just as it took effect.

Draco was jerked from midair and fell back into mid air. It was one of the most disorienting experiences of his life, and then he realized he was upside down. He straightened, paused a moment for the dizziness to settle, and then was immediately pleased that he'd thought to a bring a dragon into a magic fight.

And it was all out war.

The Portkeys had brought all the Order members back to each other, right above Black Water. The plan had been to split up, divide the Death Eaters into three groups, and then when the Death Eaters were far enough away, all Portkey back to the town, finish off whatever Death Eaters had hung around, and complete the escape.

The plan had also been for Voldemort to chase after one of those groups. Draco had been sure he'd follow the horcrux, and then when they would Portkey away, they'd leave him in their metaphorical dust.

But Voldemort hadn't fallen for that trick. He was far too clever. He knew that they couldn't afford to stay split up for long. He knew they would always regroup, because unlike the Death Eaters, they didn't have expendable group members. All Voldemort had to do was wait for them to return.

And he had waited with an army of a dozen Death Eaters, all on brooms, all fighting. The other Order members were surrounded. Voldemort was –

Draco blinked for a moment – because Voldemort was flying. Actually flying. No spell, no broom, just his power.

It was terrifying. Also terrifying was the Chinese Fireball dragon that had finally got over the shock of the Portkey. It shook its massive head and snarled, smoke coming from its nostrils.

"Right," Draco told himself, and settled on a plan of action. He shot forward, slipped just under the dragon's head, and shot out a stinging hex. The dragon roared, and gave chase. Flames shot out of its mouth. Draco had to veer to the side, but then he corrected his course, leading the dragon straight for the mass of Death Eaters.

The well-organized group of Death Eaters fell into chaos at the sight of the dragon barreling down at them. It gave Draco the prime opportunity to take a few of them out, and then he needed to drop down and out of the dragon's sight. There was still Voldemort to take care of.

Draco did glance to locate Ginny – she was fine. Bill was with her, and Sirius as well. They had each other well-covered. The Golden Trio was together – and a rather effective fighting team. Dumbledore was fine on a broom. He was casting rather benign charms that none of the Death Eaters bothered to block. Fools. Dumbledore was lighting them up with smells and lights that would only attract the dragon.

Voldemort – for all of his power of flight – appeared to be hanging back. Almost as if he was conserving his energy.

Draco paused for a split second. Was he weakened from the battle at the house? Or was he simply waiting for the opportune time to strike?

Draco took out two Death Eaters with the ear-drum bursting charm he favored, and thought, for a split second, if Voldemort truly was weakened, they had a chance of winning this skirmish.

And then a rush of more Death Eaters swept in from the clouds. They descended on the battle, distacting the dragon and tearing through the sky. Draco was surrounded by a group of four. It was more difficult than a fight on the ground. He was hard pressed to shield himself and keep his balance. It was difficult to keep an eye on all four when they could come at him from the sides and from above and below.

So he Apparated out of their midst, managed to clip one with a curse, and dis-broom another. And then he heard a cry, risked a glance, and saw that Ron had been hit. The Golden Trio had been separated. Draco Apparated over to him, managed to stabilize him on the broom, and then Sirius flew over.

"Time to get out of here!" Sirius yelled to him.

Draco frowned, but knew it to be true. Portkeys, especially ones created last minute, were easily trackable. The original plan had been to beat the Death Eaters back enough so that they wouldn't be able to follow them.

But needs must, and their final location could be secured rather well. Well enough to escape back to England at the very least.

"Take Ron," Draco called to Sirius. "I'll spread the word."

Sirius nodded, and then he and Ron disappeared. Draco rejoined the battle, cutting down two Death Eaters by shattering their brooms beneath them – which was actually far more difficult then it looked. He passed by Bill and Ginny. "Second Portkey!"

"You too!" Bill yelled back.

Draco waved, to show that he understood, and then glanced back to see them both disappear. Good.

The Death Eaters had finally managed to run the dragon off. The Headmaster, and Harry and Hermione, were the only ones left. Draco sped towards them, because still Voldemort was hanging back – and he didn't like it.

"Time to leave!" Draco called, slashing out at a Death Eater with a freezing curse. The Death Eater dropped.

Harry half-turned to Draco, busy fighting off a group with Hermione's aid. Draco leveled his own wand to help, and then Voldemort struck.

The Dark Lord swept out his arms, like a conductor in front of an orchestra, and suddenly Draco was swept hard to the side. He barely managed to hang onto his broom. He crashed into a Death Eater, tried to shove him off, and then the air jerked again. Draco's broom tipped. He looped himself up and over to straighten, and the air jerked again.

He wasn't the only one being thrown about. The Death Eaters were caught in it as well, as was Harry and Hermione. Draco got pulled into a sweeping, circular air current – and he suddenly realized that Voldemort wasn't mindlessly whipping them around. He was creating a vortex.

The tornado Voldemort was creating was large. Draco spun in a slow, wide circle – perhaps a Quidditch pitch in size. And he wasn't alone in it. He could see the Death Eaters trapped and flailing as well – obviously not prepared for their master's tactics. He could spot Harry and Hermione.

The speed was picking up. Draco needed to break free, so he gunned his broom faster, and rode it tight around the bend of the tornado, hoping to slingshot himself out of the vortex.

Voldemort saw him. Voldemort raised his hands, and suddenly the air spun faster. Draco was sucked back in, crashing into another broom – Potter. Harry grabbed onto him, trying to level them both, and maybe two brooms together could break free. Draco opened his mouth to yell the plan to Potter, but then Voldemort appeared.

Draco shot a stunner, but Voldemort used his wind power to whip the spell away and then grabbed the goblet from Harry's belt.

Harry yelled a curse, as did Draco. Voldemort simply shoved them both back into the tornado, and they were flung apart. Draco spun into another Death Eater. He saw brilliant flashes of light from outside the whirlwind. Dumbledore and Voldemort were dueling.

The air whipped faster. The tornado tightened. A Death Eater screamed as he lost his grip on his broom and fell. They were spinning to fast. Any minute now they would start pulling g's, like astronauts leaving earth.

Draco felt his head start to spin. His vision spotted. He needed to stop the tornado. But how –

Heat.

A tornado needed a cold updraft and a warm down draft.

Draco gripped his wand, brought it down in a large strike, and yelled out, "Ferveo!"

The wind slowed, but it didn't stop. The black spots still remained in his vision. His stomach churned. He channeled every though he could about hot summer days in France and cast out a rather illegal summer-weather charm, "Aestas!"

The tornado fell apart. Draco and the rest were tossed out into warm summer air and bright sun, all of the clouds completely dissipated, and the wind nothing more than a summer breeze.

Draco keeled over on his broom, feeling his own skin become ice-cold. The spell used the caster's own body heat to amplify the weather. He slipped a little to the side, his hands too icy to hold onto his broom the right way.

"Hermione!"

The scream was Potter's. Draco looked up through heavy eyelids. Dumbledore had retrieved the goblet from Voldemort, and in retaliation, Voldemort had grabbed Hermione.

Draco shuddered, his vision grayed out, and when he opened his eyes again, two objects were falling. One was the goblet. The other was Hermione.

Dumbledore and Voldemort were both in motion, diving down. Harry was diving as well, but far too clumsily, still disoriented from being caught in a tornado.

But Dumbledore – Dumbledore could have easily grabbed the goblet.

He grabbed Hermione instead.

Voldemort grabbed his horcrux and laughed. He Disapparated. The rest of his Death Eaters awkwardly followed.

Draco's hand slipped again on his broom. He was going to pass out. The battle was over. Time to leave. He reached into his pocket and grabbed the inkwell. The Portkey pulled him away.

He appeared over the front lawn of his chateau in France. A figure was on the ground with red hair. Draco directed his broom down – it was Bill. He'd been pacing, his face worried.

Draco reached he lawn and tried to swing off his broom. He couldn't quite manage it, but then Bill was there, and Draco didn't hesitate to grab onto his shoulders for balance.

"Draco. You're freezing!" Bill exclaimed, the worry obvious in his voice.

"Going to be sick," Draco told him, eyes fastened on the lawn, trying to force down the ever growing nausea, but he was so cold, and so dizzy. He hunched over and threw up.

Bill pulled him away from the mess, and Draco felt his knees buckle.

"Draco!"

Draco was dimly aware that he had half-crumpled on the ground. There were voices around him, then hands. And then there was a commotion. He looked up blearily to see the others arrive, and then the world went a little out of focus. He was moving, and then he was lying down on something soft, and then he closed his eyes.

OoOo

Draco's chateau was really nice, Bill thought – not for the first time.

He glanced around the room, trying not to grimace at the exhausted, grim atmosphere. They were beaten and bruised. He didn't think anyone had gotten away unscathed. Ron had the closest go of it – fortunately Sirius had managed to get him out of the fight in time. And thankfully Draco had a great deal of emergency medical supplies at his home. The gaping chest wound Ron had received was now simply an impressive scorch mark.

At least they were safe. Draco's chateau had been the easiest place to link an emergency portkey too – and it offered the best protection again Voldemort without having to travel all the way back to England.

Not that Voldemort would seek them out again. He had his horcrux.

"I'm just happy we're all here," Harry said abruptly.

Bill glanced up, as did the others, all in various states of recline. Harry and Hermione were snuggled together on a love seat. Ron was next to them on an armchair, his face still showing traces of pain.

Sirius was standing at the fireplace. He had been deep in thought, but he turned at his godson's words. Dumbledore, who'd been puffing a pipe in the corner, looked over as well.

Ginny had already been looking at Harry – or rather, Hermione. They'd been exchanging faces and wordless conversations – most likely because Ginny was lying pressed to Draco's chest on the large sofa. He'd been unusually clingy – first to Bill when he first collapsed, and then Ginny after he was treated. Granted, he was also half-unconscious and freezing cold, so Bill supposed the usual barriers didn't apply.

Still, it was odd to see him so openly demonstrative, butGinny looked quite content to spend the evening snuggled with her boyfriend.

In fact – Draco was the only one who hadn't looked up at Harry's words. His eyes were closed and his body lax. Bill wondered if he was actually asleep or just faking.

"It doesn't matter if we lost the battle," Harry continued. "We're all safe – and that's really what matters."

Bill watched the others respond to the words. Hermione gripped Harry's hand a little tighter, Ron perked up just a little, and Sirius nodded. "Too true," he seconded.

"It was the right choice," Harry said, and the rest of the room echoed the sentiment – again, apart from Draco. Bill was beginning to think he actually was asleep.

Harry turned to Dumbledore. "You made the right choice, sir. Our lives are worth more than the horcrux."

Bill could tell the Headmaster was troubled. In truth, Bill would not have been surprised if Dumbledore hadn't chosen to save Hermione. Not that he'd been surprised that Dumbledore had saved her – and not that he didn't think it was the right call, but Dumbledore was very much akin to a general. He had to make the hard choices.

Dumbledore smiled and crossed over to pat Harry's shoulder. "No need to thank me, Harry." He smiled at the two and then retreated back to his corner.

Bill was the only one who saw Draco's eyes shoot open, and the quick, assessing glance he took at Dumbledore. His face was blank, still in the soft, relaxed pose of sleep, but his eyes were clouded. Bill shifted, concerned at that look.

Draco caught his gaze.

'What is it?' Bill wanted to ask, because he didn't like that look.

Draco only closed his eyes again, but his brow furrowed, like he was puzzling through a particularly hard riddle. Bill didn't like that look. Any easiness he had gained through Harry's encouragement faded. He settled back into his seat and tried to reclaim the peace.

It was not to be found.

OoO

Thanks for reading. And I am shooting for updating every two weeks. Fingers crossed it actually works!





36. The Problem

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a wonderful habit of procrastination - which leads to unkept deadlines. Whoops.

OoO

Draco started when the door opened, and then immediately scowled. He wasn't usually caught off guard like that.

Bill frowned at him from the doorway, also catching his surprise. "You okay?"

Draco waved him off. "Fine." He looked back at the work on his table, and tried to figure out what he'd been doing. He was in the middle of Harry's parseltongue journal, and he'd been… He couldn't remember. Draco pushed the journal away in a huff.

It was an uncharacteristic show of annoyance – directly countering the 'fine' he'd told Bill. He wasn't okay. Bill took the hint. He stepped further into the study and shut the door behind him. Draco slumped down in his chair – pleased that Bill had picked up on his frustration, even thought Draco wasn't admitting it verbally. It was too hard to speak the words sometimes. It was easier to pretend that Bill was just being nosey and that Draco was still the fortress of solitude he liked to think he was.

"What's wrong?" Bill asked, taking the seat across from him.

Draco looked at him, and let out a huff of dark laughter. "Everything, Bill. Everything is wrong."

Bill paused. "I can't tell if you're being serious, or if this is normal teenaged melodrama."

Draco waved away his attempt at levity. "I'm serious, Bill. There is something hugely and terribly wrong. I cannot even begin to tell you how wrong it is."

"Are you going to tell me what it is?" Bill asked.

"I can't even find the words for what is wrong," said Draco. "And there's no point in telling you what it is because – well, because I don't know what to do about it."

And maybe that was teenaged melodrama. Maybe Draco should just spit it out, and yet it was so horrible he could barely even wrap his head around it. The problem had been nagging him ever since their unsuccessful attempt to recover the horcrux.

"Okay," said Bill. He sat forward. "Is it something wrong with you?"

"I'm fine," said Draco, and then at Bill's pointed look, "okay, I'm obviously concerned. And stymied. And frustrated, along with whatever other psychological troubles I'm accustomed to dealing with. But no, this doesn't involve me."

"Okay," said Bill, slightly slower. "Is it something to do with me?"

"No, you're fine."

"About Ginny?"

"She's fine, too. Well – you know, quite more than fine, but I'll refrain from singing her praises as not to make you uncomfortable."

"If you can be sarcastic, I'm not sure this problem is as big as you're making it out to be," said Bill.

Draco sat up straighter, because he needed Bill to take him seriously. He needed to figure out what the hell he was going to do about this. "You're fine, Ginny's fine, and your family is fine. The problem is…not immediate."

"Okay," said Bill. "Does it have to do with the fact that Voldemort still hasn't rejoined his horcrux to himself?"

"Partly," said Draco.

He and the rest of the Order had assumed Voldemort would rejoin his horcrux to himself as soon as he had time to conduct the ceremony. Harry had been dreading his dreams every night since they got back, and still Voldemort had not performed the ritual. The working theory was the Voldemort was going to keep this horcrux a secret – keep it as a failsafe, so that even if he was defeated by the Order, he would still have a piece of his soul to live on.

"Is this a problem that we should know about?" Bill asked. "One that's going to impact the Order?"

"Hugely and irrevocably," said Draco. "And that's why I can't say anything more."

Bill's face constricted. Draco knew the former professor wanted to ask – knew that it was eating at him.

Draco leaned forward. "Bill, I'm not telling you what it is just so I can be mysterious or to tease you. I'm not telling because, if I'm right, the Order is going to fall apart. It's going to be chaos and fear and betrayal and so much pain, and I don't want to give that to you."

Bill met his gaze. "It's not fair to ask you to hold onto something that big yourself. I can tell you're struggling. You haven't been yourself these past couple of days. You're distracted and aloof. You're even more short-tempered than usual. You aren't picking on anyone. Even my mom's worried."

Draco sat back and sighed. "I know. People are worried. But that's fine. I'll be out of the house tomorrow when school starts."

"Is it about school?" Bill asked. "You know, you don't have to go back if you don't want to."

"No, it's not school."

"Then what can I help you with?"

Draco took in a slow breath, and let it out even slower. "The problem is – well, I'm nearly one hundred percent certain that it exists, that I'm not reading too much into things or making it up. And one person is at the heart of the problem, but I don't know what to do about it."

"Who's the person?" Bill asked, and then when Draco shot him a look, "not the person's name, but what's the person like?"

"Gryffindor," said Draco.

Bill nodded. "Okay. Problems with Gryffindors are best solved with the direct approach. You go in, and ask whatever it is you need to ask, point blank and face-to-face."

Draco blinked at him. "It is that easy, isn't it?" he realized.

"What were you planning?" Bill asked.

Draco shook his head. "A hundred roundabout and indirect ways of questioning." He carded a hand through his hair and let out a half-laugh. "Simplicity. It ought to be the Gryffindor motto."

"And what will you do when you get your answer?" Bill asked.

Draco pursed his lips. "I haven't the faintest."

"A problem for another day, perhaps?" Bill asked.

Draco nodded.

Bill nodded as well and stood up. "Now come in for dinner. Mom's made us a big send-off meal for all you students."

Draco looked back at his work on the table, the parseltongue journal he'd been neglecting, the knife that had been pushed to the side, the scrawling notes for the Veritaserum that had all but been forgotten.

"Hey, Draco." Draco looked up. Bill was looking at him, eyes concerned. "You'll tell me what it is, won't you? If not now, than someday?"

Draco nodded. "You'll be the first when I do tell. Once I… once I figure it out."

"Okay," said Bill. "Now come in for dinner. No sense worrying on an empty stomach."

Draco followed Bill in for dinner. It was a large affair. He couldn't tell if it was because the adults were sad that they'd be sending the students back to school, or if it was because they were celebrating that fact. Certainly it'd free up some room in the house.

Conversation over dinner mostly focused on expectations for the remainder of the school year, and Mrs. Weasley trying to make sure everything had been packed. "We're leaving for King's Cross bright and early," she lectured her kids. "No packing in the morning, you hear me?"

Ron rolled his eyes and got a sharp tongue-lashing. Ginny nodded dutifully, and then shot Draco a wink and a grin. He had to shake his head back at her. Practically Slytherin, that was.

Draco retired to his room after dinner under the pretense of packing, but he'd already been packed ever since they'd first heard that Hogwarts was being re-opened. Although, now he wasn't planning on traveling back to school – at least, not before solving this rather important matter. Now he just needed an excuse to skip the first day…

There was a knock on his door, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. He turned as Charlie poked his head in. "You got mail." He handed over a letter.

Draco nodded his thanks. He'd redirected his mail from the manor to the Order Headquarters, and the Order was used to delivering him vast quantities of mail at odd hours of the day. Being heir to the Malfoy Estate and business came with a great deal of written correspondence.

Pansy peeked out over Charlie's shoulder. "Hey, Draco."

Draco raised an eyebrow, because Pansy was wearing jeans and a button down flannel shirt – to be sure the flannel shirt was unbuttoned to reveal a great deal of cleavage – but the point still remained. Pansy. In flannel.

She grinned at him, like she knew what her wardrobe was doing to his brain cells, and jumped on Charlie's back. Charlie let out a theatrical 'oof', but obligingly carried her back downstairs. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose because sometimes he was completely baffled at the way life turned out – and that particular pairing was one of them. He understood why it worked. Theoretically it made perfect sense. And yet, in practice, he was still as shocked as the rest of the Order – well, okay, not that shocked. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's faces upon discovering that Charlie was dating Pansy were the perfect example of 'thunderstruck'.

Draco turned his attention to the letter at hand. It was from Advocate Preston, who was handling his case against the ministry.

Curious, he opened the letter and scanned the contents. Something heavy and constricting lifted off of his chest, and he hadn't even realized it was there until he was suddenly breathing easier. The letter informed him that Lucius's body was being released from Azkaban. It would be sent to the Manor for burial in the family cemetery.

Draco dropped down onto his bed. He took in an easy breath, and then another. It was a welcome peace – one that he needed. He shut his eyes and slept until morning.

He wasn't quite expecting the level of chaos that came the next morning. He shouldn't think it was that difficult to see five students off to school, especially when most of them were self-sufficient – well, at least Draco was self-sufficient, but apparently lots of noise and banging of doors and exasperated sighs were part of the norm for the Weasley family. It started well before Draco actually got downstairs and continued upon his arrival in the dining room.

"Oh, good, you're up, Draco," said Mrs. Weasley, looking half frantic. She was both trying to serve breakfast to the adults and direct the movement of luggage that that already gathered by the door. "Do you need any help getting your trunk downstairs?"

Draco took a hasty step back as Ron ran past him, shouting something at Fred and George. Apparently they'd hidden all his underwear. Hermione was the next to hustle in, looking for her monster of a cat.

"I'm actually not going to Hogwarts today," Draco said, and even as loud as the room had been, it suddenly went silent. Everyone turned to him, startled.

"You're not going back to Hogwarts?" Ron asked, completely forgetting his fight with the twins. "Can you do that?" He appeared suddenly struck by a thought and turned to his mother. "Can I do that?"

"Don't be ridiculous, Ron," Mrs. Weasley chided. "And of course you're going to school, dear," she told Draco. "But if you're feeling a little queasy, I can get you some peppermint tea, if you'd like."

The thought of him having pre-school jitters was so laughable that Draco couldn't help the smile that tugged at his lips. "I'm fine, but thank you. I'll be skipping the first day or so of school." He held up the letter he'd received last night. "Lucius's body was released from Azkaban. I'll be burying him once I can make the arrangements."

There was a brief moment of silence, and Draco watched the Order try to process that piece of news. Their expressions filtered first to an immediate frown of distaste at the mention of his father, and then shifted to contrite, because Lucius was dead and they wanted to support Draco, but then their faces did a weird twist as they remembered it was actually a good thing Lucius was dead, and they didn't need to feel that bad about it, and so they settled on cautious sympathy.

All except Bill, who immediately pushed the chair next to him out from the table, and Draco sat next to him while the rest of the table figured out what to say.

"We're very -," Mr. Weasley started, and then stopped. Draco figured he was going to say 'sorry for your loss', and then realized that would be untrue.

"We're very sorry that you lost your father," Bill said, in a very tactful and honest way. "Will you need us to help you with anything?"

"Not this morning, no," said Draco. "Maybe tonight though?" He shot a look at Bill, who nodded.

"Of course."

Draco nodded back, grateful for that. "I'll need to head out now. But I'll be back later."

"We'll let Dumbledore know," Harry said. He was the only student sitting at the table, apparently the only student apart from Draco who didn't need guidance to pack his things. But then again, Harry also didn't have any parental support. Draco got a sudden mental image of a tiny Harry Potter, waiting for his aunt and uncle to unlock the cupboard beneath the stairs, and then quickly placing all his school belongings in his trunk, hoping not to forget anything before the cupboard was slammed shut and locked up again.

Draco also got a sudden flash of anger that had a lot to do with the monumental problem he'd been worried about for the past several days. But he simply shot the boy-hero a quick nod of thanks, even though it was unnecessary. Draco was going to see the Headmaster very shortly. Not that anyone knew that was where he was actually headed.

Draco stood. "I'll be Flooing over to the Manor for now." He paused, because Ginny wasn't down yet, and he did want to see her off. But he was short on time. He needed to get to Dumbledore before the school officially opened.

He glanced to Hermione. "Tell Ginny I said goodbye?" Hermione and Ginny were close – he figured it'd mean more by asking Ginny's best friend to pass along his message than having her brother or mother relay it.

"I will."

Draco paused for one more moment, because something wasn't setting right with him. A strange sense of foreboding filled his mind - but Draco didn't put much stock in precognition, or even prophecy. It was far more likely he was unsettled because of the problem at hand. He shook the feeling off, tossed Floo powder into the fireplace and stepped through to the Malfoy Manor. From there, he threw in more Floo powder and requested entry to the Headmaster's office in Hogwarts.

He stepped through, trusting that he'd caught Dumbledore in his office, trusting that the Headmaster would recognize that a Floo from Malfoy Manor would be important.

Sure enough, it only took a moment for him to be allowed to step into the Headmaster's office. Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk, papers and schedules spread out over the surface – all the last minute decisions and plans for the remainder of the school year.

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows at Draco, but gestured for the seat in front of his desk.

"What brings you here, Mr. Malfoy?"

Draco took the offered seat, and then paused because this direct sort of confrontation felt foreign to him. Sure, he'd directly threatened and attacked people before. But rarely had to addressed a problem so bluntly. Dumbledore waited for him to find the rather Gryffindor candor.

Draco took in a breath and then said, "You chose to save Hermione instead of the horcrux."

Dumbledore learned forward and steepled his fingers. "You think I made the wrong choice?"

Draco shook his head. "I think that if the goblet had truly been the Horcrux, you would have caught the goblet and let Hermione fall."

Dumbledore tilted his head to the side. "What led you to this conclusion, that the goblet is not a horcrux?"

"Because had the Dark Lord retrieved his horcrux, he would have immediately rejoined himself to it. He already has control of the elements, and the power of flight. If he had another piece of his soul reclaimed, his power would be incredible. He would not give up that opportunity." Draco stopped, and waited for Dumbledore to say something, but the Headmaster was silent. "Am I wrong so far?"

"No," said Dumbledore. "And please, continue."

"At first, I didn't understand why you didn't tell the Order that the goblet wasn't a horcrux," said Draco. "The only reason not to tell them, would be if the final horcrux is something unobtainable, or something truly terrible."

"And that would be?" Dumbledore asked. His face was serene – as if Draco wasn't unraveling the horrible secrets that he had been keeping for so long.

"And Ginny couldn't sense the horcrux when we were in the vault," Draco said. "Not until Harry picked it up."

Draco stopped, because he didn't like unraveling the truth, not when it was this terrifying.

"Keep going," said Dumbledore.

"Harry Potter is the final horcrux," Draco said. He took in a measured breath and felt the tension in his body build.

"And what else?" Dumbledore prompted again, almost gently.

Draco tried to continue, but the words hitched for a moment. He forced them out anyway. "The only reason you wouldn't have told the Order this, the only reason you wouldn't tell Potter, is if you can't figure out how to separate Potter from the horcrux. And if they can't be separated, then when Harry kills the Dark Lord, Harry will also die."

It felt worse to speak his realization out loud, but Dumbledore simply folded his hands together. "It's worse than that. You know that it's worse than that. Don't hide the truth of the matter now, Mr. Malfoy."

Draco glared at the Headmaster, because how dare Voldemort scold him for feeling overwhelmed at this dark, tremendous truth. "Harry won't be able to kill Voldemort while he's still a horcrux," he said icily. "And Voldemort won't be able to kill Harry. They're in symbiosis together. And you haven't told anyone this because you don't know how to separate them. Which leads us to the conclusion that if Harry can't kill Voldemort, than he isn't the savior you made him out to be. So what, in the name of Merlin, are you going to do about it?"

Dumbledore sat back in his chair. "Bravo, Mr. Malfoy. You put it all together."

"Don't congratulate me," Draco spat. "What have you been doing to figure out how to disconnect Potter from the horcrux?"

The Headmaster's eyes sparked. "What have I been doing? I have been doing everything in my power to save that boy, but the fact of the matter is, there is no undoing it. Not that I can find. Harry cannot be separated fro the horcrux."

Draco felt irritation well up in his chest. "Then what's the next step?"

"Isn't it obvious?" the Headmaster asked. "When a solution becomes impossible, look at the problem again. That's what I've been doing. Do you know what the problem is, Draco?"

Draco rolled his eyes. Of course he did. "We have a savior that can't save us."

"Precisely. We've been trying to fit Harry into the shoes of the savior because he is the Boy-Who-Lived, because he defeated Voldemort before, first as a baby - ,"

"Which was really more of his mother saving him," said Draco, feeling the need to be contrary, because he was annoyed, so Dumbledore should be as well.

"Exactly," said Dumbledore – and Draco blinked in surprise, not expecting to get agreed with. "His mother saved him," Dumbledore continued. "And during his first year, when Harry defeated Voldemort, it was mostly due to the fact that Voldemort couldn't touch him – again, his mother saving him. The second year he defeated Voldemort mostly because he is the horcrux, and therefore has imbibed some powers form the horcrux."

"Parseltongue," said Draco. And now it made sense why Draco's readings said that Harry actually shouldn't be speaking parseltongue when he was.

"His third year he fought off Dementors- but not really the Dark Lord, the fourth year, well, that was also due to the fact that Voldemort can't kill him because of the horcrux, and his fifth year was more of a team effort, and his sixth year – well, there wasn't much of a showdown then, was there? You had the most excitement that year, I think."

"What are you getting at?" Draco asked.

Dumbledore sighed. "We've been trying to fit Harry into a position that may not be his. And at the time it made sense, but there's also the matter of the prophecy." ,"

Draco snorted, and Dumbledore caught it. "So you've heard it then."

"Potter may have recited it to me."

"So you know what's wrong with it," said Dumbledore.

Draco started, again, not expecting the Headmaster to agree with him. "It's bullshit. The whole part about 'one can't live while the other survives' has some serious logical flaws."

"Because they're both living and surviving now," said Dumbledore. "When I first heard it, I didn't think much of it. Prophecies are known to be vague things. But the more that it appeared that Harry could not fill the prophecy the more I started questioning it. And the source of it."

"Who gave the prophecy?"

"Trelawny."

Draco shook his head in disbelief. "That old coot?"

"At the time, she was very convincing. But upon further investigation, she admitted to stealing it from one of her ancestors. There is Seer blood in the line – and Sybill happened across an old journal of prophecies in the attic, prophecies that had been recorded for generations and generations."

"The original wasn't in English, was it?"

"No. It was Latin."

"Did you translate it more accurately?"

"Most of it works out to be the same. Of course, in Latin, there's a bit more specificity in the 'live' and 'survive' lines. It works out to be 'Neither will flourish while the other survives'."

"I figured as much," said Draco. "What else?"

Dumbledore hesitated. "The birth month could be different."

Draco shot him a look. "What do you mean, could be different?"

"Depending on who originally wrote it and when, well, you know he different calendars that wizards have kept."

"What are you thinking it is?"

Dumbledore looked at him, his eyes serious. "What month were you born?"

Draco shook his head, confused. "You have my birth records for school, what does that -?"

"How many times has Lucius defied the Dark Lord?" Dumbledore asked.

And Draco finally realized what the Headmaster was asking him. For a moment, he couldn't quite comprehend it, and he laughed, once, a loud, harsh burst of laughter that immediately betrayed how shocked and confused he was, because he didn't laugh, not really.

And then he saw that the Headmaster wasn't laughing, that he was looking at Draco with a grave and somber expression, and Draco finally understood how serious the Headmaster was, and his stomach dropped.

"No," he said.

"I thought Harry was the one," said Dumbledore. "But he can't fulfill the prophecy."

"I don't fit. I don't fit it."

"Your father has defied Voldemort more than once," said Dumbledore. "According to the old Moon Calendar, you were born in the seventh month."

Draco shook his head, feeling slightly sick. "No."

"He marked you, Draco."

Draco's eyes shot to his arm. The knife, and his scar. It looked like a snake.

"You are far more powerful than Voldemort realizes," said Dumbledore.

"That's ridiculous. I'm not – I'm not the savior."

"Harry can't be the savior either," said Dumbledore, and Draco looked up at the Headmaster, and saw he was deadly serious, and suddenly he was angry. Draco was so angry he felt a flush over his skin, almost like he was on fire.

"How dare you?" he snarled at the Headmaster. He grabbed the arms of his chair, afraid he might lunge at Dumbledore and strangle the old man. "How dare you mold and manipulate that boy into your fucking image and then throw him away like he's nothing?"

"I never wanted this," Dumbledore tried to defend himself.

"No!" Draco bit back, and now that the initial shock was over, the heat faded from his body, leaving him frigidly cold. He stood, smoothly, and stared down at the Headmaster. "I will not let you throw Harry Potter away simply because now it's inconvenient for you to have pinned your hopes on him. How many years did you let him rot before saving him from his relatives? How many life and death scenarios did you throw at him? How many secrets did you keep – all because you felt it would better him, make him stronger, smarter, turn him into a general, a savior at the age of seventeen? And now, oh – you were wrong? And he has to die? And you want to pin it all on me now? A boy you detested? A boy who was raised in the very pit of the viper you're trying to destroy, a boy you hardly took notice of? Dared not even to throw a lifeline to? Now I'm your savior?"

Draco took in a breath. Dumbledore was staring at him, expression conciliatory, like he was mollifying Draco by letting him vent. Draco leveled a finger at him. "If you breathe a word of this to Potter – if you make him doubt, for the smallest of seconds, that he is not the savior I swear I will kill you and throw you from the astronomy tower – do you understand me?"

Dumbledore looked at him, pityingly. "There's no arguing with the prophecy."

"Then you don't know me well at all," Draco said. "Because I'm very good at arguing."

"What will you do?" Dumbledore asked.

"I'm going to find a way to separate Harry from that horcrux. Then, I am going to personally ensure that Potter provides the killing blow – even if I have to fight the whole rest of the war myself. Because I'm not your savior. I'm nobody's savior. I'm too far-gone trying to save myself, but Potter – Potter's a savior, regardless of whether a prophecy says it or not." Draco gave one last, hard look at the Headmaster. "There was a time when you believed that too."

And then he turned on his heel to stride out of he room, and his exit was only marred by McGonagall bursting into the office.

"There's been a Death Eater attack!" she cried. "On the Hogwarts Express!"

OoO

Ginny woke up, half dazed, half confused, and really, really cold.

She pushed herself up and looked around. She was in a bare room. There was a door in front of her, and a window behind her. She pushed herself to her feet. She felt dizzy – and sore – and for a moment she couldn't quite remember what had happened.

And then she did. She had been at the station for the Hogwarts Express. There had been an explosion and an attack. There had been barely enough time to draw her wand before someone had grabbed her and then –

And then it went dark and she woke up here. Wherever 'here' was.

She tried the door first, even though she knew it would be locked. She didn't bother wasting her energy banging on the door. She went to the window instead. It looked out over a deserted, rocky beach. From the yellow of the sand and the orangey-brown of the rocks, she wasn't in England anymore.

She wasn't surprised to hear the lock turn on the door behind her. Whoever had grabbed her would have been waiting for her to wake up. Ginny turned – and she was surprised to see the figure in the doorway.

"Hello, Ginny," said Claire.

The blonde woman stalked in. Her hair was nearly twisted back, her expression cruelly smug.

"Why am I here?" Ginny asked.

Claire stopped in the middle of the room. She pointed her wand at Ginny. "You are a problem of mine."

"How so?"

"The Dark Lord thinks of you fondly."

Ginny couldn't help but flinch. She silently cursed herself for it, wishing she could be a bit more unreadable.

"Your boyfriend thinks of you fondly as well," said Claire. "And the Dark Lord thinks of him quite… viciously."

Ginny tried to school her expression into one of blankness. "Does Thomas know that I'm here?"

She saw the way the name irked Claire, the way Claire's expression turned a little violent. Yes, Ginny had a weird connection to Voldemort – or rather, Tom Riddle. Tom – who wished that his name had been Thomas. The full name, not the diminutive form of it.

"I told him," said Claire. "He'll come to visit you, once I'm done with you."

Claire stalked closer, and Ginny refused to back up, refused to show her fear.

"He only said not to kill you, not to cause any permanent damage – do you know why?"

Ginny bit the inside of her cheek.

"It's because Draco doesn't know you're gone yet. And a game of hide-and-seek is more fun once the seeker knows who he's looking for. And it gets even more fun when the taunting starts. If we go too fast, the game will be over before it can begin."

Claire lunged forward and grabbed her, and Ginny tried to fight back , but Claire had a wand, and Ginny didn't.

"Crucio!" Claire shouted, and Ginny dropped in pain. She screamed, her muscles on fire, lightning shooting through her nervous system. She would have fallen completely to the floor, but Claire yanked her head up by her hair. Claire's wand flashed down, and then the pain stopped, and Ginny dropped fully to the ground, her muscles deadened with the curse. Her face smacked painfully into the cold stone of the floor. Claire stepped back, and Ginny could just lift her gaze to see her hair – her long, red hair – held in Claire's hand.

Claire shot her a triumphant smile. Ginny lifted one trembling hand to the back of her head. Her hair was gone – chopped short in the back. Ginny could feel the ragged, shorn ends, could feel her bare neck. Claire held her hair up liked a trophy.

"I'll send this to him," said Claire. She looked at the hair, then back at Ginny. "It will look better with some blood on it."

She stalked forward, grabbed Ginny again, and her wand struck out. A cut appeared on Ginny's arm, long but shallow – and it hurt, it hurt more than it should, some kind of stinging hex on top of the curse. Ginny clamped her mouth shut over a scream. Claire grabbed her arm and dragged her cut-off hair through the blood, staining her hair even redder.

Claire stepped back with a malicious grin. "I'm having fun now, Ginny. And it's jus started."

Claire strode out of the room, the door clanging shut behind her. Ginny curled in on her self, her hands reaching up to her head. It was easy to feel her skull now. Her neck felt bare and cold and naked.

Her hair being chopped off was worse than the Cruciatus. It was worse than the cut on her arm. Claire had taken her hair, had stolen a piece of her. Ginny took in a ragged breath, feeling like she was going to cry, and hating herself for it. She would not cry. She would not show weakness.

She pressed her head against the stone floor, and the necklace that had been tucked in her shirt slipped out. A rose-cut, pale pink diamond.

The necklace from Lucius.

'He may be able to find you,' Dumbledore had said.

Lucius was dead – but if it worked on blood magic, surely Draco could trace it, couldn't he?

Ginny wrapped her hand around the diamond. 'Find me," she whispered. "Find me."

OoO

So much for two weeks, huh? Blerg. Alright - I'll try for two weeks again for the next chapter, cross your fingers, knock on wood, etc.





37. A Rescue and a Reveal

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. Also – I'm late on the update. My apologies.

Also - kudos to those people who laughed at the Astronomy tower line in the last chapter. I like to amuse myself sometimes, and it's extra better when people laugh with me.

OoOoO

Strong arms grabbed him, and threw him back against the wall. Draco's head bounced against the paneling, and lights flashed in his vision. He knew what was coming though, and dropped to the floor just as the curse flashed against the wall, tearing out a chunk of wood, right where his head had been a second ago.

Draco rolled to the side and cast his own curse. The Death Eater fell back, stunned. Draco set out another blasting hex. The same one he'd sent off when he'd first burst into Goyle's house. It'd taken out half a dozen Death Eaters on his entrance. It took out the remaining three now. The curse left him feeling drained.

Draco got to his feet and took a moment to lean against the wall. It wasn't just the curse that had left him feeling drained – it was the past eight hours. After he'd learned about the attack on the Hogwarts Express, Draco had Flooed over with Dumbledore. The train had been badly damaged. It'd taken several hours to rescue students from the wreckage and then identify those that were missing. Twelve students. Including Ginny.

Draco had performed a search for bodies on the wreckage. He'd felt both relieved and terrified when no bodies were found. They were taken; not dead.

After that, it was a quick trip into Knockturn Alley. He'd Apparated away before anyone could think about stopping him. He'd found Macnair with the help of an informant, and capturing the man hadn't been easy. He'd taken out half of Ravus Umbra before incapacitating the former executioner and taking him to the dungeons in Malfoy Manor. He had crucioed the man for half an hour before he broke and told Draco that the students were being held at the Goyle's estate.

Draco had sent Macnair through the Floo to the nearest Auror office, and then rejoined the Order with the information. He knew that the Order must know how he'd gotten the information – and yet no one seemed to mind all that much.

Draco looked around him now, and spotted movement in the corner. Someone was trying to get up. He sent out a stunner and then cautiously lifted his hand from the wall. He stayed on his feet.

He knew he wasn't at his top form. The battle at Ravus Umbra had left him a little battered, holding a crucio for as long as he did left him drained of energy, and attacking Goyle's house – well, his head ached and his body twinged from the damange from the attack. Nothing too bad. He had a shallow slice to the neck where a hex had gotten uncomfortably close to hitting its mark. His knee sent up flares of displeasure – he'd wrenched it trying to dodge the slicing hex. His head throbbed from hitting the wall.

Overall though, he was in much better shape than he should have been.

Draco paused. He'd just battled nine Death Eaters. He was a genius – not a soldier. He shouldn't have walked away this easily. Something wasn't right.

Draco stepped over to the nearest Death Eater and pulled off his mask. He blinked down at the face. He didn't recognize this man. Or did he? It was vaguely familiar. Draco frowned and his fingers tapped out their familiar pattern as he thought. 1-3-2-4, 1-3-2-4, 1-3-

He blinked, the memory coming to his mind. Travers, Harris. 23. Arrested for minor crimes, theft and disorderly conduct, two years ago. Draco had seen it reported in the papers. But if Draco didn't recognize him as a Death Eater, than he must be incredibly new, and it was incredibly unlikely he'd be promoted to something at big as guarding the Goyle's house full of kidnapped students.

Draco flicked his wand and pulled all the Death Eater's masks off. He surveyed the fallen combatants. He recognized only three other faces – also petty criminals. All relatively young.

Why on earth had these novices been tasked with such a large task?

Unless it was a trap.

Draco froze for a moment, considering that possibility. But surely any trap would have been sprung by now. And Bill had checked the wards thoroughly before the Order had launched their assault. Nothing had been amiss.

So if it wasn't a trap, then it was a diversion. The students were a diversion.

Draco frowned and left the room, walking a little stiffly to favor his knee. Who would go through the trouble of kidnapping twelve students and take no firm precautions for keeping them?

The students had been no-namers as well. No one important. No one with any ties to the Ministry or the Order – all except Ginny, of course, and –

Draco paused in the hallway. Only Ginny had been high priority.

He knew what that meant. Ginny had been deliberately targeted.

There was only one person who would do that, only one person who would want to hurt Draco that way – and it wasn't Voldemort. He was too focused on Harry.

Draco quickened his pace. His knee protested, but Draco pushed the pain away. He all but ran down the main hall and to the back, where Macnair had said the children had been held.

He could hear voices and children crying. He rounded the corner and pulled up short. Sirius and Remus were in the middle of placating the children. Harry and Hermione were standing by Ron; Hermione was clutching his hands and saying something to him.

Arthur Weasley was speaking with Dumbledore, his face white.

Draco swept a glance at the children, counting them, even though he already knew what the result was going to be. Only eleven students were present. Ginny wasn't here.

Draco reached out for the wall again. It felt solid underneath his hand, and suddenly the ground didn't seem all that stable. He tipped against the wall, then slid down it, rather ungracefully, to sit on the floor. Something strange was happening inside his chest. It felt like learning Lucius had been sentenced to death all over again. It felt like loss.

Bill ran in, wand out and breathless. He looked around, taking note of Draco on the floor, but more focused on the students as well. Draco watched Bill. He watched the eldest Weasley search the students for a familiar head of red-gold hair, and when he didn't find it, he watched him count. And then recount.

And then Draco watched Bill's expression change from hopeful to terrified. His skin paled. His eyes widened. His jaw worked, and then he asked, "Is she-?"

Draco briefly wondered if his face had done that – but he knew it hadn't. Any expression of fear had been trained out of him. He knew his face was just as flat as his voice when he said, "She's not dead."

Bill turned to him, all the Order members did.

Draco shrugged. "Only new Death Eaters guarding the house? No students of priority taken? Easy enough to find Macnair? This was just a diversion."

He saw that Dumbledore understood. The rest were taking a while.

"Diversion for what?" Bill asked.

"For me," said Draco. "This was just…it was just the start of a game."

"A game?" Arthur Weasley echoed, voice outrage. He took a step forward. "You think this is just a game?"

Draco looked at him. He could see all of the emotions on the Wealsey patriarch's face. It was raw and honest and uncomfortable to watch. "When a cat plays with a mouse, the mouse never thinks it's a game."

He got to his feet. His body ached and stung, but his head felt oddly numb. "Let's go to the Manor," he said.

He led the way out. He heard the murmuring behind him, but his brain felt to heavy to decipher words or feelings. He found the nearest fireplace and Flooed over to the Manor. He stepped out in the front entrance hall. The others – Bill and Dumbledore, Arthur Weasley and the Golden Trio followed.

Tolly was there, wrapped in his towel. He had a box in his hand. "This arrived for master." And then his eyes widened. "Master is hurt! Master is injured!"

"That will be all," Draco said.

"But Master-,"

"Leave!" Draco snapped, and the elf bobbed it's head and vanished.

Draco looked at the box in his hands. It wasn't very large, a shoebox size at most. It was wooden, and expertly carved. He walked to the waiting room adjacent the hall and set the box down on the writing table there. He reached to open it, and then something twisted so viciously inside of him that he couldn't even touch it. He flinched back, stepped awkwardly on his injured knee, and staggered.

"Draco!" Bill caught him, worry evident in his voice. "Draco, what is it?"

Draco opened his mouth, trying to respond, and whatever fear that had seized him, dried up his mouth. He could only shake his head and pull away from Bill.

"Is it the box?" Bill asked, and stepped towards it, hands reaching out.

"Bill, don't!" Draco found those words at least, to warn him, and Bill stopped, startled.

"Draco, what is it?" he asked again.

"Don't – don't open it," said Draco, because even though he was trying so hard not to think about what could be in the box, even though he was working his mind to the full capacity not to have those images in his head, he logically knew what it could be. He didn't want Bill opening up that box to discover his sister's finger or hand or heart or worse.

And maybe he was showing some fear on his face now, or maybe it was the fear in his voice, because Bill paled again, and understanding swept across his face.

"It's a game to her," said Draco. "And I don't know… I don't know how vicious she'll be." He glanced to the others who had come in, glanced at Mr. Weasley. "I'm sorry. This is because of me."

And then he stepped forward to the box, because he wasn't a Gryffindor, no, not at all, but he was a Slytherin. Gryffindors would face the worst head on, and then lick their wounds in private. Draco would face the worst head on, and then figure out how to dole out a punishment that was ten times worse.

He reached for the box again, and his heart seemed to constrict and his hands shook, but he opened the lid and stared inside.

Red hair was in the box. Red-gold hair that was tied in a thick tail with a ribbon. Red-gold hair that was stained with dried red-brown blood.

Hair.

Ginny's hair.

He knew it was hers without casting any charms. He closed his eyes for a moment and took a breath in. His heart seemed to ease, seemed to beat a little slower. Just hair. It was just hair.

"What is it?" Bill asked, and Draco stepped aside and retired to the wing-backed armchair beside the table. He closed his eyes again.

He heard the exclamations, he heard the fear and the outrage and the terror.

Hair. A soft first step to Claire's game. She was being cautious. She was being cautious because she must be working under certain limitations. Voldemort's limitations. He knew that Ginny and Voldemort had a strange relationship. He doubted that Voldemort would let his current plaything damage Ginny irrevocably – not when she'd possessed his journal, a piece of his soul for a full year. No – Ginny was safe, for now. And the only way to play this game was to hand it over to the professionals.

He opened his eyes. "Tolly."

The house elf appeared. He was holding a med-kit in his hands. Draco rolled his eyes. "Get the Aurors, Tolly."

The room fell silent. "What?" Arthur Weasley demanded.

"Ginny's been kidnapped," said Draco. "I plan to file a report."

"A report?" Ron yelped. "It's Death Eaters, Malfoy!"

"It's Claire," said Draco. "She's made a rather public attempt on my life already, and at a Ministry-sanctioned event none-the-less. The Aurors will be very motivated to find her, and they have more man-power and tools at their disposal than I have."

"She'll be killed!" Arthur protested.

"I was sent her hair," said Draco. "Not her finger, not her hand, not her head. Her hair. The Dark Lord won't allow Claire to do any irrevocable damage, so right now, the only satisfaction Claire is getting is my reaction. And I'm not giving her one."

Arthur stepped forward. "You're playing with her life!"

"Don't you dare accuse me of that," Draco said, feeling anger rise in his chest. "I am doing my utmost to protect her, by not involving myself. Believe me, I'd love to track Claire down, I'd love to sweep in and save Ginny and drive a knife through Claire's heart – but that only falls into what Claire wants – that will only escalate the damage done to Ginny. And I won't be responsible for that."

"The Ministry is incompetent against the Death Eaters," Arthur protested.

"You just helped Kingsley get elected," Draco countered. He shook his head. "Trust me. You know I wouldn't do anything to get Ginny hurt."

"We trust you, Draco," Bill affirmed.

Draco nodded his thanks, and then turned to Tolly. "The Aurors. I'll meet them in the blue parlor." The elf nodded and disappeared with a pop. Draco put the lid on the box of Ginny's hair and picked it up. It felt oddly heavy in his hands. He looked at the Weasley family. "Ginny's related to a very powerful man. It will help her now."

He moved to the door.

"Oy, Malfoy, you're not married to her yet," Ron called behind him.

Draco turned and frowned. "Not me," he said, and then looked around the room. "Do none of you get it?" he asked, somewhat exasperated. Form their looks of incomprehension, they had no realization. Draco pinned a dark look on Ron. "Your brother, Ginny's brother, is the Assistant to the Minister. When I file this report with the Aurors, the entire Ministry will be alerted and tasked with finding Ginny. And that's even without Percy being notified." Draco shook his head. "Do none of you have any idea...?"

He turned back and headed to the blue parlor, wondering how Percy managed to put up with it all for so long. It was easier than thinking about Ginny. Because while Draco knew he was doing his best to save her life, the logic wasn't enough to overcome the dread.

Was this love, then? Is that why he was so afraid? So afraid it over-ran even the strongest logic in his head?

If so, it was a horrible emotion, and he didn't know if he wanted it.

OoOoO

Ginny screamed.

She finally screamed, and when she finally did, she wasn't sure if it was fear or pain or just anger.

And Claire – Claire only laughed. Not in triumph. Not in victory. But in mocking. Like a bully laughs after pushing a child, and the child falls down.

Ginny caught in her breath, tried to suppress the scream, but then Claire leveled her wand, and the pain started again – but it wasn't the pain that made her scream.

It was the conjured mirror that was levitated above her – so that Ginny could see herself reflected in it. She could see herself pinned down on the floor, could see her shirt pulled up, exposing her stomach, and could see the words that Claire was branding into her skin.

'Property of Tom Marvolo Riddle'

It was like her hair all over again. The words were worse than the actually pain – but Ginny was beginning to realize that this was where Claire succeeded, in the mind-games. Sure, the pain was bad. Her stomach hurt, the brands hurt – they burned like a hot poker from the fire, and it radiated up and down her body – but the words were worse.

Ginny had once belonged to Tom – when she'd been possessed, and she'd been a child then, defenseless and helpless, and she still had nightmares to this day, still hated the sound of thunder – and so the words were far worse.

And the act of the torture was worse. Ginny was magically pinned down, unable to move, arms stretched up above her, just as defenseless and just as helpless as when she was a first year student against a magically possessed diary.

Ginny knew it was a mind-game. The mind-game was working.

Claire pulled out a vial from her robe, but then hesitated, looking down at Ginny's stomach. She flicked her wand again, and Ginny bit back a shout, and a tiny heart appeared over the 'i' in Riddle, like an infatuated child would write. Claire laughed, mocking again, and then tossed the contents of the vial over Ginny's stomach.

Ginny screamed at the sudden sharp pain, tears stinging her eyes. The liquid hissed and steamed and let out a foul stench.

"It will scar now," said Claire. "It will be there forever. Every time you and your boyfriend try to be intimate, he'll see those words, and he'll know who you belong to." Claire smiled, smug. "I really just evened the game, if you think about it. He's already got his brand." Claire gestured to her left arm, where Draco's scar was. "Now you can match each other."

Claire paused, considering. "Matching scars. Now there's a thought. Maybe I should do some work on your arm." She nodded. "But first, I think he needs another incentive." Claire flicked her wand again.

There was no blood on Ginny's stomach. The words had cauterized as soon as they were seared into her skin. Claire's spell made the words break open and bleed. Claire stepped forward, and Ginny wanted to fight, but all she could do was uselessly struggle as Claire grabbed her shirt and ripped it off her body, leaving Ginny in her bra and jeans.

Claire roughly dragged her shirt through the blood. Ginny choked back a cry of pain and anger. Claire laughed again. "I'll send this in the mail, and then be right back for round two."

She left, the door clanging shut behind her. The bonds holding Ginny disappeared, and she gasped in relief, curling up over her stomach, her arms covering the horrible, stupid words.

Her hand reached up to the necklace again, and she wrapped her fingers around it. She didn't know if it was working or not, but she'd been holding it ever since yesterday morning, ever since she was first brought here.

"Find me," Ginny whispered. "Find me."

"I already have, Miss Weasley."

Ginny's eyes flew open in shock. She pushed herself up to a sitting position and stared at Lucius Malfoy, who stood in the center of the room, as if he'd just Apparated in, even though Ginny hadn't heard him arrive. He stood tall and poised, regal and serene. And very much alive.

"You're dead," Ginny said.

Lucius gave her a bored look. "My presence would suggest otherwise."

Ginny got to her feet, still awkwardly covering her chest, because somehow being in a bra in front of Lucius Malfoy was more startling than him being alive and present.

"Are you a ghost?" she asked.

Lucius removed his outer robes, fine gray silk, and stepped forward. He pulled it over her shoulders. "Do I feel like a ghost?"

Ginny shook her head and gratefully slipped her arms inside the sleeves and wrapped it tight around her, wishing for a belt.

Lucius frowned at her head. "I suppose the haircut is due to your imprisonment here, and not some new fangled fashion?"

Ginny ducked her head, one hand rising to her head, self-conscious, even though that was ridiculous, because she had been kidnapped, and had little say in the matter.

"You have good bone structure, but you really shouldn't go shorter than a bob," Lucius remarked idly. "But let's not get distracted. I believe you are in need of a rescue?"

"If it's not too much trouble," said Ginny, a little faintly, because she couldn't quite get over the fact that her boyfriend's dead father was currently rescuing her from the clutches of the dark wizard he used to work for.

"It was smart of you to wear the necklace," said Lucius, and then his lips pursed. "Also, very foolish."

"Aren't the two contradictory?"

He smirked. "Hardly. Now if you'll take my hand, Miss Weasley, we shall abscond from this prison to a more suitable locale."

He held out his hand, and Ginny reached out, having to push up the sleeve of his robe to grab his hand. But no sooner hand she reached out, the door opened and Claire stepped through.

Ginny flinched back. Claire stopped short.

Lucius flicked his wand. "Avada Kedavra."

Claire didn't even have time to gasp in surprise, or cower in fear. The green light struck her before her mouth could even gape open, and she fell straight to the floor.

Dead.

"That's how you deal with a nuisance," said Lucius. "No grand schemes. No witty sayings. No gloating." He turned to Ginny and leveled a look at her. "Take simple, decisive action." He held out his hand again.

Ginny took it, decisively. "There's time enough for gloating when it's all over?"

He smiled, all teeth. "Precisely."

And then they Apparated. Or rather, didn't Apparate.

It was more like they melted through the floor and through time and through space. Ginny's head felt heavy. Her mind felt dizzy.

"Sleep," she heard Lucius say, and so she did.

It was quite a while until she woke up again. Or rather, if felt like quite awhile, but it could have been no more than minutes.

She woke up in a bed, a hospital bed by the look of it, all white blankets and white walls and white ceilings. There was someone sitting to the left of her, someone speaking quietly to a dict-a-quill while paging through a stack of papers. Someone with a soothing voice and extensive, posh vocabulary.

Ginny turned, expecting Draco – and seeing him for a moment in the man's posture – very straight, but with a particular stiffness in the neck that spoke of tensed muscles. And then she saw the square glasses and neatly brushed red hair.

"Percy."

Percy turned, immediately setting aside his work, and smiled. "How are you feeling, Gin-gin?"

Ginny couldn't even bring herself to scowl at that hated nickname. She held out her hand, and Percy took it gently.

"What happened?" she asked.

"You managed to escape a Death Eater hold," said Percy. "You're currently in Italy. The Ministry managed to track you down, and sent out an international rescue squad, but by the time they found you, you'd already managed to escape. They backtracked your escape from a Death Eater sympathizer, but everyone was gone. All except the body of one Claire Jameson. You, obviously, won't be charged in her death."

Ginny shook her head. "It wasn't me."

"You had help?"

Ginny paused, wondering what to say. Percy sat back in the chair. "Does it have anything to do with the rather powerful protection charm you have around your neck?"

Ginny reached up to touch the necklace.

Percy sighed and closed his eyes for a moment, a pinched look setting over his features. "Please tell me it wasn't Lucius Malfoy."

Ginny pulled her hand away. "He's dead."

Percy opened his eyes and gave her a look that made her think of Draco again, all poorly concealed impatience.

She shrugged. "He's supposed to be dead."

Percy heaved a sigh, but then leaned forward and patted her hand again. "Well, I suppose it's not all bad if he saved you."

"You suppose," said Ginny, mock affronted, and then wondered, "What are you doing here?"

"I'm not officially here," said Percy. "But it'll take a while to get Mum and Dad here, and they said you'd wake up soon, so I thought I'd stick around." He gestured to the frankly alarming stack of parchment. "Paperwork can get done mostly anywhere."

Ginny pushed herself up a little in bed to get a better look at it, but then stopped and hissed in a breath. Her entire stomach ached, and she pressed a hand against it.

"Oh, so you should know," said Percy, his voice falling serious. "The…brand on your stomach." Percy stopped for a moment and rubbed his head. "So – they have a really good cosmetics program here in Rome – so I had someone come over to take a look. It was a bit of a complicated procedure – but basically you have new skin growing, and some new muscles, so just… take it easy for a while, huh?"

Ginny stared at him, and then pushed down the covers and pulled up the white pajama top. Her stomach was red – a little inflamed from the procedure – but the skin was smooth and flawless. No marks remained. She let out a breath of relief that was a half-sob, and then pulled the top back down. "Thank you."

Percy shrugged, like he was uncomfortable with the thanks. "Yes, well...,"

He trailed off, and Ginny, curious, reached up to her head. Her hair was still short.

Percy held up his hands. "I wasn't about to make a fashion decision for you. But – if you did decide you want it regrown, let the nurse know, okay?"

"I think that's usually pretty expensive," said Ginny, and then she wondered how much the new skin on her stomach had cost.

Percy huffed out a breath. "You're my sister, Gin-gin. I'd say I'd foot the bill, but honestly, most of the Italian Ministry is so embarrassed that Death Eaters are using their country for hideouts – and even worse, that the Assistant of England's sister was kidnapped – that I'm pretty sure they aren't going to charge."

Ginny paused to consider that. "Oh."

Percy huffed out another breath, checked his watch, and then stood. "Mum and Dad will be here soon. I'll head out now."

Ginny reached out to grab his hand. "Why don't you stay?"

Percy shook his head and pulled away from her grasp. "You know that's not a good idea. In fact, I wasn't even here, okay?"

Ginny didn't like it. She wanted to protest, but Percy's expression was tight around the eyes, and he looked tired, like he hadn't slept well.

"Okay," she said.

Percy smiled. "Take it easy, Gin-gin."

He gathered up his things and left the hospital, as quiet and as unobtrusive as he usually was.

Ginny sank back against the pillows and closed her eyes. Sleep came naturally.

OoOoO

Please leave a review!

Oh - also, I should note that I didn't edit this chapter too much - wanting to get it up as soon as it was written. I apologize for any typos/bad grammar.

Also also - That was not how I intended to do away with Claire's character. There was a far more extensive plot, and there were witty sayings and grand schemes and a little bit of gloating, and then when Lucius arrived to save Ginny, he shot me a rather annoyed look and killed Claire. And then pretty much told me what he told Ginny. That truly capable and intelligent characters don't connive or gloat; they simply do what needs to be done. And then they gloat afterwards. Which, I was like, "But she deserves a worse fate!" (because I really had planned quite the intricate piece of revenge) and then Lucius told me, "Only amateurs allow their emotions to get in the way of what needs to be done."

And he has a point, you know. There's something very cold about his complete lack of hesitation/emotion in his actions, like she was just a piece of business, not even a person. And I thought it fit, because she's so vicious, and caught up in the mind-game of it all, it makes sense that she wouldn't even see something coming like this - so matter-of-fact and impersonal. Because Claire liked to make everything personal.

Anyway - that was far too much discussion about imaginary characters talking to me - but I thought you might appreciate the insight into the why and how of killing off a character. And yes, Lucius' resurrection will be explained.





38. Revelations

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I might own a house soon - so I guess that's pretty cool? Idk, I'm mostly freaking out. Which is why this is late. Also because I went on vacation. So it was really busy in real life. Sorry for making you all wait.

OoOoOo

The Aurors left. Draco sat back in his chair and rubbed the bridge of his nose. This was the fourth pair he'd talked to. Once the first Aurors had realized what Draco was reporting, they'd immediately got their supervisors, and then the supervisors had gotten their supervisors – and then continually up the chain of command.

It was now four hours later, and the Aurors who had just left were the Chief of Operations and the Supervisor of Domestic Affairs. Reporting the kidnapping of the Assistant Minister's little sister was going to get a lot of political attention.

Draco glanced at the clock. It had been four hours. Four hours since he received a box full of Ginny's hair. His mind – during that time – hadn't stopped sending him images of what might be happening to her. He could see it all, in perfect detail. Claire would only be able to scare her – to superficially harm her. There was a lot of damage one could do with those parameters.

But that was only if Voldemort was aware of what was going on. If Claire had kept Ginny's kidnapping a secret, or if Voldemort wasn't reigning Claire in –

Flashes of blood and limbs filled his mind. Draco let out a breath, like he'd been punched. It felt like he'd been punched, the way his stomach dropped and curled. He leaned over his desk as nausea rose up. His face felt hot. His chest grew tight.

Anxiety, his mind supplied. It was all in his head.

But that, really, was the trouble with it all. His head was full of thoughts. Thoughts, and probabilities and possibilities, endless possibilities, all played out in perfect detail.

But no. Logic said Ginny was fine. Logic said that Voldemort was protecting Ginny from the worst damage. They had a bond, that Draco knew. Voldemort let Ginny call him 'Thomas' and that proved – right there – that he cared more for Ginny than Claire in some strange, twisted way.

But there was a chance. There was always a chance that he was wrong, and his brain helpfully supplied all the ways he could be gravely mistaken.

What if Voldemort valued hurting Draco more than he cared for Ginny's safety?

What if Claire was hiding this from Voldemort?

What if Draco was reading the whole situation wrong?

What if – ?

Draco stood abruptly. There was a cabinet full of liquor in the corner. He retrieved a glass from the sideboard, then thought better of it, and picked up the full crystal decanter of whiskey.

Whiskey. Not his drink at all. He took a long pull form the bottle, and then coughed, his eyes stinging from the burn, but no tears forming. He waited for it to hit him – and it did, because his stomach was empty and it twisted and clenched as the whiskey hit. He waited longer, waited for the alcohol to hit his bloodstream, waited for the depressive qualities to be felt, needing his brain to slow down. It wasn't enough.

He took a longer pull from the bottle, and then another. Getting wasted sounded like a good idea. Anything to shut his mind off.

He slumped into a chair in front of the fireplace. The fire flickered to life, activated by his presence. Draco shut his eyes as the world suddenly spun a little. The whiskey was working then.

He was doing the right thing, wasn't he? Logic said yes. Logic said he was doing everything right.

He took in a bracing breath and held it, let the statistic comfort him. He opened his eyes to gaze into the fire. He'd done everything right. He was making the right moves. He let out the breath slowly and felt the fear subside. Good. Rationality was returning. Draco took in another measured breath.

But what if he was wrong?

Draco flinched from the thought, and then quickly gulped down several more swallows. What, in Merlin's name, was wrong with him?

He pulled back from the bottle, coughing again. He grimaced as he felt his stomach churn with the alcohol. But the alcohol wasn't helping. If anything, the fear was growing.

He was so sure of himself – so arrogant when he had first decided what to do. But he'd been wrong before. He wasn't infallible. And if he was wrong, he wouldn't be paying the price. Ginny would pay it. Ginny could be hurt if he was wrong. She could be tortured and maimed and raped and killed.

More pictures in his head – no, not pictures. Pictures were stationary. Pictures didn't move. It was a vision. A vision of Ginny screaming and crying and bleeding and –

Draco took another swig of whiskey. The vision didn't fade.

He needed something stronger.

He got up, moving swiftly for the kitchens. His mind automatically filtered through the ingredients that would be stocked, waiting for him. Not all of them – of course not all of them, but enough.

There were a few house-elves there, startled to see him. He ordered them to leave, and then flicked on the cauldron. Then it was two bottles of wine – the good kind – and ground dragon-claw powder. And a really good wakefulness-inducer – the type that was kept behind the counter at the apothecaries, and after that –

"Draco?"

Draco turned. Bill was in the doorway. It looked like he'd run here. His hair was disheveled, his expression tight. But that could be because he was worried about Ginny.

"Everything okay, Draco?"

Bill was concerned about him then. But why would he - ?

Draco looked back at the ingredients he'd pulled out on the counters, and the cauldron, already heating up over the flame.

Oh.

Draco turned the cauldron off, and then glanced down at the decanter of whiskey still in his hand.

"Tolly said he was concerned," Bill explained. "Something about Narcissa-?"

"Yes. She used to - ," Draco gestured at the ingredients and then scrubbed a hand over his face.

"You okay?" Bill asked again.

"Not entirely," Draco admitted.

Bill took a few steps forward, eyebrows furrowing.

"I just wanted to stop thinking," said Draco.

"You said that having the Aurors handle it is the best thing to do."

"And it is," Draco insisted. 'Logically it makes the most sense. Logically it is the best way to get her out. Logically it's… It's right. I just – keep thinking, what if I'm wrong? And then I wanted to stop thinking."

"Are you craving it?"

"No," Draco shook his head, and then reconsidered. "Well, I mean, now, sure I am. But I didn't even realize that's what I was doing until you came in." Draco huffed out a breath, a little nonplussed that he didn't even have enough higher brain function to send him a warning signal, and then he swayed a little, because the whiskey had definitely hit him now. "Funny. For wanting to stop thinking, I seem not to have been doing to much of it."

"You're not really thinking," said Bill. "You're feeling. Big difference. Makes you do stupid things sometimes."

Draco made a face. "Then I guess that's what I'm trying to stop. The feeling."

Bill laughed and then reached out and took the decanter from his hand. Draco let him take it, but to his surprise, Bill didn't put it away. Instead he took a large swallow. He shrugged a shoulder when Draco raised his eyebrow. "We all feel too much sometimes. Come on, let's get something to eat, and then find something to distract you."

"Like what?" Draco asked, somewhat darkly.

"I don't know," said Bill. "I assume that all you're thinking about is Ginny, so it should be something related to her."

"But I can't use any of my contacts. They'll get back to her; they'll play into what Claire's doing."

"All of them?" Bill asked.

"The trouble with people who sell information, is that they sell it to other people too," said Draco. "There really isn't a whole lot of honor among thieves."

"Yeah, but surely you have some allies that aren't that unscrupulous," said Bill. "Or contacts that aren't on the dark side."

Draco's mind sparked because Bill was right. Lucius had always played both sides, and while the dark side might spy and sell information, there were a few honest contacts out there.

"I can make a few calls," he said, and made to walk to his study, but Bill pulled him towards the dining room. "Food first. I'm serious. Besides, you're a little drunk right now.

He was. There was no point denying it. So Draco ate lunch, and then took a few sobering-up potions to negate the alcohol in his system. And then he called all the contacts he'd neglected before. Honest Aurors. Good custom agents, moral magical law enforcement agents, and honorable experts in tracking spells and locations charms. Anything to give more assistance to the Aurors.

He stayed up all night, barely slept the next day, and by the next night he drank a dreamless sleep just to get a few hours of escape from the thoughts that plagued him. Because the fear wouldn't stop, and his mind was always his worst enemy, and he was terrified to think what his Boggart would be now if he let him out. Would it even be Lord Draco anymore? Or would it be Ginny, betrayed and bloodied and dead?

"Draco!"

He shot up from sleep, certain that someone had said his name, but he wasn't sure where he was or who was with him at the moment. He turned. Bill was beside him, smiling.

"They found her. She's okay."

It took a moment for Draco to process that information. They had found her? So quickly? Last Draco had heard they'd narrowed it down to Southern Europe – Italy or Greece – maybe Croatia. And narrowing it down to Southern Europe meant it'd be another two days at least. Something must have happened.

"Where?" Draco demanded, immediately getting out of bed.

"Italy," said Bill, and Draco was reaching for his wand when Bill added, "The Aurors are setting up a portkey. We leave in twenty."

Twenty minutes.

Draco blinked and considered twenty minutes.

No, not fast enough. He could get there in five. A quick floo to the France estate. From there, a permanent portkey to the Italian villa – which would mean a quick stop at customs, but there were men on the payroll that would let him through without too much trouble.

Five minutes of action versus twenty minutes of waiting. It wasn't even a choice it was so obvious.

Draco grabbed his wand, but Bill stopped him. "Draco, she's okay. Twenty minutes. We're all going."

Draco paused. Bill was right. He couldn't very well leave the Weasley family here, could he? Not when they were her parents. He'd have to take them with him. He could round them up in five minutes, have then through to France in one minute. Another four to get to Italy and – at that point, it all evened out in the end.

Draco let out a breath. "Twenty minutes."

"Go take a shower," said Bill.

Draco nodded and numbly did as he was told. It only took ten minutes to be ready to go, and when he went down to the blue parlor, the Weasley family had already gathered. Arthur and Molly were exhilarated, holding hands and smiling largely. The Weasley boys were rambunctious with relief.

Draco couldn't quite muster the same excitement. It was strange. He was relieved to hear she was okay. He was pleased that she was safe – he knew that, and yet, instead of excitement, or joy, or reprieve, he felt strangely hollow inside.

Draco curled up his hands into fists and felt the bite of his nails sharp against his palms. Perhaps he was still tired. Perhaps he needed to wake him up.

But the hollowness remained, despite the pinch in his hands. It made him feel uncomfortable. Almost detached. Slow. Merlin, he hated feeling slow.

The minutes dragged until the Aurors arrived with a Portkey, and then suddenly they were in Italy. They'd arrived in the lobby of a hospital, but Draco could only tell by the smell of anti-septic and healing potions. The physical appearance of the lobby couldn't look any different from a hospital. It was decorated like a resort. The walls were a bright terracotta. The windows were large and opened up to the beach outside. The weather was obviously charmed to stay warm, and the scent of the ocean did it's best to mask the hospital smell. The halls were quiet, but with a comfortable murmur of the waves on the shore.

"Mr. and Mrs. Weasley!"

Draco looked over. There were two high-ranking Italian Aurors accompanying a man in a very well-tailored suit. Draco recognized him to be the Italian Secretary of Foreign affairs. He immediately approached Arthur and Molly, his hands held out to grasp theirs.

"Please, Mr. and Mrs. Wealsey," the Secretary said in heavily accented English, "let me express, on behalf of the Italian Government, how appalled we are about this terrible event. Please, accept our humblest apologies. We pride ourselves in having a safe and secure nation, and to think that our country was used as a vehicle for such an unthinkable crime – well, it is too awful to consider. We are devastated. Absolutely devastated."

Draco watched Arthur Weasley fumble for a response, obviously not used to having foreign dignitaries fawn over him.

"You must stay in Italy while your daughter recovers," the Secretary continued, but now a Healer was approaching, and Arthur and Molly were no longer listening. Instead they beelined for the Healer, leaving the Secretary to bustle after them, trying to hold their attention. "Your accommodations will be covered by the Italian government. If you have any needs, please, only let us know."

"How is she?" Molly demanded of the Healer.

"She'll make a full recovery," said the Healer.

Molly Wealsey grabbed her husband's arm, obvious relief on her face.

"Can we see her?" Arthur asked.

"Please, follow me," said the Healer. He gestured down the hall.

The Secretary trailed after the family, still talking, "We've already apologized to the Assistant Minister, and we will be working with your Aurors to identify how this came about."

The Healer showed the family into a private room. The Secretary stayed outside, calling after them, "Please, do not let this unfortunate incident impact the relationship of our two countries!"

Draco paused at the door, not quite knowing if he wanted to go in or not. He looked at the Secretary instead, who looked a little unnerved.

"Is the Assistant Minister still here?" Draco asked, wondering if Percy had hung around.

"No, he left just moments ago," said the secretary. "Mr. Malfoy, please accept our nations apologies. If we had any idea that such criminals were crossing our borders, we would have done everything in our power to stop them."

Draco held out his hand for the Secretary to shake. "I completely understand," he said, and then he let the Secretary run through the entire gamut of apologies because someone needed to listen to them and offer absolution. No doubt Percy had gotten the speech as well, but double assurances were always necessary in such delicate situations.

Besides, Ginny had her family to greet. Draco could wait.

It took twenty minutes until the Secretary felt comfortable enough to leave, and then Draco stalled another twenty by getting Ginny's chart from the Healer and reading over the injuries sustained.

It was nothing too bad. Some nerve damage from the Cruciatus that would heal with time, two weeks tops. A brand on her stomach that had already been treated with the most advanced healing spells and cosmetic procedures. "All expenses paid," the nurse was quick to reassure him. A few bumps and bruises. A few scrapes and cuts. Nothing more.

Draco put the chart down and waited for the relief to come. He waited for the joy. Waited for the happiness. Waited for the elation.

It didn't come.

Something was obviously wrong with him. What kind of man wasn't pleased that their girlfriend was okay after such an ordeal? Why wasn't he pleased?

Draco walked numbly to Ginny's room and paused in the doorway. He saw Ginny, propped up in bed, pillows surrounding her, her family at her side, holding her hands, patting her head. Grinning and laughing, and he was struck dumb and numb in the doorway.

She saw him and smiled. She reached out her hand, and so beckoned, he stepped forward. Charlie pushed Fred and George out of the way so he could come up to her bed side, and he did, all the while the hollowness growing, until he was sure that she must see it.

She did. Her head tipped to the side. Her eyes questioned him, and then her hand grabbed his.

Her fingers were warm.

Her skin was soft.

Her hand was strong, and it squeezed his, reassuring, and then something finally clicked into place.

Draco dropped to his knees by her bed. He wasn't sure if it was deliberate, or if his legs no longer worked. Something hot and bright released in his chest, and he brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her fingers, like it was the most natural thing in the world – no matter that her family was there.

"Hello," he said, eyes only on her face. Her hair was cropped short, but her eyes were bright, and her smile brighter.

"Hi," she said back.

That warm feeling swept through his body, wiping away all traces of numbness. Now that he could see her, now that he felt her, alive and well, now he could be relieved. Now he could be happy.

Draco heard Bill shepherd the rest of the Weasley family away. He heard them leave the room, but all he could see was Ginny's face. Her beautiful, gorgeous, completely unblemished face.

"I was worried," he said, even though he couldn't help but return her smile, a smile that was so pure, it was as if she had never known what worry or fear was.

She reached up with her free hand and cupped his cheek. He turned into her hand, and pressed a kiss on her palm as well. She laughed.

Draco felt his cheeks redden. "I was really worried," he admitted.

"I'm fine," said Ginny.

"But you weren't for a while." Draco had read her file.

"You've been hurt before," said Ginny. "You've worried me before."

Draco frowned, because that wasn't the point he was trying to make – but he couldn't quite figure out what he wanted to say.

"Now you look confused," Ginny said, and laughed at him again.

"I was worried," Draco said again, and then paused, because that wasn't what he was trying to say. He tried again, "I was scared. You scared me. I was scared that you were hurt, and in pain, and that you were going to die and I - ," he stopped. He suddenly knew what he was trying to say.

He sighed and then got up to sit on the side of the bed. She pushed herself up a little higher in bed and took both his hands. "And you?" she prompted.

Draco frowned. "I was scared because I love you."

She leaned forward and pressed a quick kiss on his lips. He tried to lean in, to kiss back, but she pulled away too fast. "What was that for?"

She smiled. "Because I love you back."

Draco sighed again, because wasn't this just a complete mess of emotions?

"Well, good," he said, but he couldn't help but think how this complicated things, and she laughed at him, bright and happy and utterly lovely.

"You don't need to sound so cross about it."

"Yes, well…," but Draco couldn't quite think of an objection, and he was uncomfortable with the emotion, so he changed the subject, "Can you tell me about what happened, so I can go find Claire and kill her?"

Ginny's expression changed. Draco tensed. "What?"

"She's already dead," said Ginny.

Draco blinked at her. "Did you – ," but he could already tell that she hadn't, even before she shook her head, and then she reached for her neck. At first, her hand closed around nothing, and then she pulled something forward, like she was trying to show him something. "Do you see it?"

It appeared in her grasp, the perception charm falling away and revealing a pink rose pendant. A pendant that had been in the Malfoy family for over a century. A pendant that Draco hadn't given her.

"Your father gave me this for Christmas," said Ginny.

Draco tried not to flinch at the mention of Lucius. He was more or less successful. "And you wore it," he said, not quite sure that was a smart thing to do, but it obviously had saved her. "Did it have a death curse on it?" he asked, because some charms would rebound lethal curses back onto the caster – not an Avada curse, nothing could rebound that – but if Claire had used a different spell…

Ginny shook her head. "He… he found me. Lucius found me, and he killed Claire."

At first, Draco didn't understand. The words made sense as words, but the message was too unbelievable. Draco blinked. "He's dead."

"He found me," Ginny repeated. "And he… he was solid, not a ghost, and he used the Avada on Claire. The Aurors have her body. He was there."

Draco shook his head this time, still not able to understand. "He's dead."

"He's not," said Ginny.

"His body was just released from Azkaban," said Draco. "I'm going to bury him this week."

Ginny looked up at him, eyes perfectly clear, expression completely serious. "Draco. Lucius is alive."

OoOoOo

Percy expected the visitor charm to light up on his desk. He'd been expecting it ever since he'd seen that necklace on Ginny's neck, the necklace that no one else seemed to notice, not even the Healers when they were performing the skin graph surgery.

But Percy had always had a knack for perception charms – that is to say, Percy had a knack for seeing past them.

"You see what is," Trelawney had told him after he miserably failed divination. The crystal ball hadn't even clouded up. It had been completely clear, and it had only reflected the table it was placed on, and Percy's own exasperated face. "You are not fooled by what others want you to see. You are not swayed by what may yet-to-be. You are attuned to this moment, fully present and fully aware. It's quite the gift."

And then she had tried to teach him how to see auras, convinced that he must have the ability since he was so "attuned with the present moment". But Percy hadn't been able to take her instruction seriously, because he could see her for what she was and not what she wanted him to see. She was a fraud.

So was Dumbledore, really.

And actually, interesting fact, most of the others who were deemed 'sensitive' to the Dementors did have the ability to see auras. Percy still hadn't learned, but that was fine with him. He enjoyed the ability to see past perception charms, and there were a lot of them in politics. It was far more useful than reading someone's mood by their aura, and Percy could do that simply by reading body language.

So as soon as Percy had seen that necklace on Ginny, seen how expensive it was, and how powerful and dark, he knew that it came from the Malfoys. And when Ginny had been found by the Aurors, already escaped from the Death Eaters, Percy knew that she'd had help. And Draco had been in England the whole time, wisely staying out of the way while funneling a whole slew of resources and information to the Aurors, and so that left only one person who could have helped her.

Lucius Malfoy.

And Percy had just gone through the trouble of getting a fake body.

That was just poor timing.

So when the visitor's charm lit up on his desk, informing him that someone was in his office, he knew exactly who it was. He sighed, paused his work, and then Flooed over.

"Where is Lucius' body?" Draco demanded as soon as he stepped into his office.

Percy sighed again, walked past the agitated teenager, and put on the kettle for a cup of tea.

"I swear to Merlin-," Draco started, and there was an edge to his voice that said this wasn't going to be pretty.

So Percy turned around and faced it head on. He was a Gryffindor after all. "Your father's body disappeared from Azkaban soon after the coroner signed off on the death certificate. After an expansive search, it was never recovered. We assumed that someone had taken it for revenge purposes. The body that was going to be released to you is fake."

He watched Draco's face change from angry to ominously blank. "My father's body was stolen?"

The kettle whistled. Percy poured two cups of tea, handed one to Draco, and then moved over to his desk. "We both know that's not the case anymore, don't we?"

He sat in his chair. Draco took the seat in front of his desk, still looking a little shell-shocked. "Ginny said she saw him. And that he wasn't a ghost."

"He used the Avada on Claire," Percy confirmed. "A ghost can't do that."

Draco reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose.

"I take it you had nothing to do with this," Percy surmised.

Draco shook his head, looking slightly pained. "I have no idea what happened."

"Well, that's hardly comforting," said Percy. "I'll add that to the list of things that need attending to."

"Send me the fake body," Draco said.

Percy raised an eyebrow.

"I want to follow through with appearances," Draco said. "Keep public attention away from it until I know what happened."

Percy nodded. "When you find out what did happen, tell me."

Draco gave a curt incline of his head. He got up, tea untouched. "Don't lie to me next time."

"I make no promises."

Draco glared at him, and it was actually a rather good glare. Percy would know. He got glared at a lot.

"It's my father," Draco said.

"Who murdered the Minister of England, was imprisoned, committed suicide – aided by yourself, I might add, and then his body disappeared. Releasing that information would have sent the whole nation into a panic."

"I'm not the whole nation," said Draco.

"No," Percy agreed. "But you're part of the nation. It was a call I made, and you don't have to like it, but it still stands."

Draco took a step forward. "Any information about my family, or that impacts the wellbeing of my family, is information I will be privy to – whether it comes directly from you, or I have to buy it from another source."

"You'll have to buy it then," said Percy. "And I can guarantee you that it will be hard to come by."

He met Draco's gaze. There was a brief moment of tension, and then Percy sighed, because he really didn't have time for staring contests. "Any other idle threats you want to impart while you're here?"

Draco huffed out a breath that might have been laughter. "I have to go back to Italy."

"How's Ginny?"

"She's fine, but you already knew that," said Draco. He pursed his lips for a moment, then said, "You could have stayed longer."

Percy shrugged. Perhaps. Sometimes it was just easier to avoid an argument by avoiding his parents. "Look after her."

"Always," Draco promised, and then he stepped through the Floo and out of the office.

Percy sat back in his chair and considered all the horrible ramifications of having Lucius Malfoy returned from the dead.

"Well... shit."

OoOoOo

Author's Note: Again, sorry for the delay. Real life took over. In other fun news...I think this might be the second to last chapter on this book. And then it's time for the End Code. Which has really just been a figment of my imagination over the past...oh, seven years or so. Lol.





39. Remembered Dreams

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a house. Seriously, guys, I own a house. Now that I have it - I'm not entirely sure I was ready for it.

Author's Note: Okay - sorry to vanish again for a bit. Did you read the disclaimer? I got a house. And with it, a whole host of fun things. In other news, I received my adult card in the mail the other day, and promptly tried to return it, lol.

In all seriousness, this book is finished! Woo-hoo! Which means only the final book remains.

OoOoOo

"Hello again."

Draco turned. He was in the Department of Mysteries. The seven doors surrounded him. Only one was open – the door to the Veil.

He suddenly remembered the stream of dreams he had experienced, shortly after the battle at the Ministry of Magic when he had pulled Sirius from the Veil. He sighed, because from what he remembered of the dreams, there'd been a lot of vague statements and elusive hints about what he should do.

He had never liked being told what to do.

Still, he turned into the chamber and walked down to the Veil. Like usual, it was fluttering softly in an unfelt wind, and whispers seemed to drift from behind the fabric.

"Hello," he said, addressing the Veil. "Another riddle for me? Perhaps some ambiguous drivel that is meant to sound wise and prophetic?"

There was laughter, a collection of laughs really, and it sounded close – very close. Like it was in the same room as him. He darted around to the other side of the Veil, but there was no one there.

"You know what you have to do," said a voice, a female's voice.

Draco hesitated. "I understand that you can't die in a dream, but this isn't an ordinary dream is it? If I walk through this thing, is it going to kill me?"

"It's symbolic," said another voice – another female, but this one sounded younger than the first.

Draco braced himself and gently reached out to the Veil. It was lighter than a cobweb, and slightly cool and silky against his fingers, almost like he was pushing aside water. He took in a breath and stepped through.

At first, it seemed as if nothing had changed. He was still in the Veil room at the Department of Mysteries. He was still surrounded by stone steps and dim lights.

But then he saw the women. Three of them. They were clothed in white, such a pure white that it seemed to glow around them. But it wasn't just their robes; it was their skin and hair as well. They emanated light like fairy stones in water. They sat around an old loom.

A loom.

Draco felt a sudden rush of fear and curiosity. He knew what they were, and he knew it had to be impossible.

They looked up at him. The eldest, stooped and hunched and wrinkled, laughed at him, a cackle, really. The youngest, who appeared about his age, fair and alluring, laughed as well, but also blushed and ducked her head.

The woman in the middle – both in position and in age – only smiled, motherly. "You read too many books, Draco."

"You're Moira," said Draco. "The Fata."

"We are not," said the motherly woman. "Not exactly. But we are appearing to you in a form you can understand."

Draco frowned. "I'm a genius."

More laughter.

"We do not doubt your grasp of the physical world," said the Mother. "It is why you have been chosen for this task. But you are small. And fixed. And limited."

Draco's mind whirled at what she said. Fixed and limited. Was that fixed in time and space? Were these three somehow beings beyond that? And limited – was that due to his physical form, or the fact that he existed on the physical plane of reality, or due to limited knowledge?

"Don't daydream," the elderly woman, the Grandmother, scolded. "Our forms aren't important, but your task is."

"What task?" Draco asked.

"Saving the world," said the youngest, the Maiden. She blushed again. "Or rather – saving the savior."

Draco took a step forward. "Harry Potter."

"Yes," said the Mother. "His soul is…," she stopped and seemed to consider what to say next. Draco knew that pause – he knew it because he used it as well, when he was trying to use small words to explain a complicated process to someone without his intellect. "Here, a metaphor," said the Mother. She plucked a thread from the loom and in her hand it changed and warped. She gestured Draco closer and he saw it wasn't one thread, but two, a white and a black thread, entwined. "The boy you call Harry Potter is entwined with another. This is his soul," she gestured to the white strand. "And this is the other's."

"Voldemort's," said Draco.

"Tom Riddle's soul," the mother agreed. "And Tom's soul," she pulled a little on the string, and Draco could see it wasn't just one string, but several strands.

"The horcruxes," Draco realized.

"They give him power. They give him life beyond what is his. And his thread in the loom of Fate is… well, causing a bit of a snarl."

She gestured to the loom, and suddenly a woven cloth appeared. She gestured to a spot where a tangle had developed.

"Left unchecked, this tangle can wreck a great deal of havoc," said the Mother. "The whole pattern might change, the cloth may fail."

There were questions Draco had. Questions about pre-destination and fate and free-will, but the Grandmother shot him a dark look. "Day-dreaming."

Draco pulled his thoughts back to the situation at hand. "So Voldemort needs to die."

"He should be dead already," said the Grandmother sourly. "But he's tied his downfall to his existence."

"He's tied Harry's soul to his," said Draco. "Meaning Harry can't kill him."

"The only one with the power to stop Voldemort is the only one who doesn't have the power," the Mother agreed. "You must give him that power again."

Draco bit back a groan of frustration because the reasoning seemed vague and circular – and there were problems with this logic from the start. Like – if Voldemort hadn't made Harry a horcrux, would Harry still be the one to stop him? Or if Harry was the Chosen One because he was a horcrux, but yet he couldn't kill Voldemort – then didn't that automatically exclude him from being the Chosen One?

"Day-dreaming," the Grandmother sing-songed.

Draco shook his head to clear it of all the questions tumbling about. "How?" he asked instead.

"Love," said the Maiden, and then her cheeks burned scarlet and she looked away.

The Mother laughed a little. "Love is the power that made Harry the savior. He has been protected by love for so long that he was imbued with its power, much like Tom is imbued with death. The fact that Harry is a horcrux is the snag that must be fixed."

"How?" Draco asked again.

The Mother held up the threads. "They must be separated. Harry from Tom."

"Yes, I get that," said Draco, getting a little testy. "But how?"

"Speak the unknown tongue in the words of the forgotten," said the Grandmother.

Draco bit back the urge to curse. "That makes no sense and gives me no information. If you want me to go on this quest, you're going to have to give me something I can work with."

"What separates Harry from Tom is love," the Mother explained. "You must split them in two, destroy the piece of Tom in Harry, and then Harry will be free to fulfill his destiny."

"Okay," Draco said slowly. He worked off of what little information they gave him. "So...love. Love is the power that can separate them. Love is being researched in the seventh door in the Department of Mysteries."

"Love," said the Maiden, and this time she didn't blush, but looked him straight in the eyes. She had familiar eyes, Ginny's eyes – and Draco wondered if that was on purpose or merely coincidental. "You've felt it. Embraced it. You understand it now."

"Pretty sure there are a whole bunch of Unspeakables working in the Love Chamber," said Draco.

"The words are in the chamber, but they do not speak the language," said the Mother.

"What language?" Draco asked.

"The language the savior speaks. He has given you the tools."

Draco raised his eyebrow. "Parseltongue?"

"Learn the language and the script."

"Script?" Draco asked. "What do you mean, script?"

"You'll find it. Now that you know what you're looking for."

And then the dream started to fade.

"Hey!" Draco said, because he had more questions, far more questions, but already the women were disappearing into the air, and the stone floor underfoot was falling away – and he was falling too – "Wait!"

Draco sat up with the strange, stomach-curling feeling that he'd just fallen a great height and landed in his own bed.

"Wait for what?"

Draco turned. Ginny was next to him on his bed, lying on top of the covers, propped up with his multitude of pillows. She had a book in her lap, her knees propped up.

Draco remembered her coming in. It was after dinner, in the evening. He remembered her complaining about being cooped up while she recovered, but it only had been two days since she was released from the hospital. She really should be taking it easy. That being said, the rest of the Weasleys had been rather overprotective. She'd come into his room to escape from their attention.

Draco looked down at the books scattered across his bed. He'd been working on his Parseltongue journal, and Ginny hadn't demanded his attention. Rather she'd sat beside him, and somewhere in the comfortable silence, he'd fallen asleep.

"You look tired," said Ginny.

Draco scrubbed a hand over his face and sighed. "Yes."

Sleep had been difficult as of late. Thoughts about Lucius, thoughts about Ginny – thoughts about Voldemort and the recently dead Claire.

And now this dream.

His head hurt. He dropped back onto the pillows and sighed. Ginny rolled over onto her stomach and propped herself up on her elbows. "What's going on?"

"I'm not entirely sure myself," said Draco.

Ginny reached out and smoothed back the hair from his forehead. Her fingers were soft and warm. It felt soothing. "Bad dream?"

"Weird dream."

"Want to talk about it?"

Draco glanced away. "Not yet. Not until I figure out what it means." His brain lazily filtered through the dream and then locked onto a relevant fact. "The script," he said, and then sat up. He turned to Ginny. "Where's Bill? He's still here?"

"It's ten pm," said Ginny. "No one went any where."

"Good, good, good," Draco rambled, and then scrambled off the bed and ran for the door.

"I'm not chasing after you!" Ginny yelled after him.

"I'll be back!" Draco called over his shoulder.

He ran down the private wing of the manor to the guest wing. Bill and Fleur were in the southeast suite. He banged on the door, rather loudly.

There was some muffled cursing from behind the door but it opened. Draco felt a little bit bad, especially when he saw Bill's rumbled hair and the lipstick stains on his neck. That was Fleur's shade, and Draco could see she'd been kissing her way down to Bill's chest, and yet Draco knew that with the way the world was, no one would leave a knock unanswered. Not even for a private moment with one's wife.

"Something wrong?" Bill asked.

"You worked at the Merlin cave, right?" Draco asked.

Bill squinted his eyes. "What's this about?"

"You still have your notes?"

Now Bill looked decidedly shifty. Draco knew why. A could of years ago, researchers had found the supposed burial site of Merlin. The news had flared up rather quickly in the press, and hen was quickly hushed by the Ministry, and then the Unspeakables got involved and quickly confiscated everything inside. But they would have needed help. Help from a curse-breaker like Bill. And Bill – well, Bill was interested in codes and dead languages. There's no way Bill wouldn't have taken notes.

"If I say yes?"

"The runes on the tomb," said Draco.

Bill shrugged. "The runes appear in a few other ancient sites, just bits and pieces of them, why?"

"I want to see them," said Draco.

"Now?" Bill asked, looking a little pained.

Draco looked at him. He wanted to say yes, he needed them right now, but it was already ten o'clock. And Bill deserved some time off.

"Tomorrow," he said.

Bill let out a breath of relief. "First thing tomorrow," he promised, and then shut the door.

Draco turned and headed back to his room. Ginny was still on the bed. She looked up from her book as he came in. "Well?"

Draco shrugged. "It can wait."

She narrowed her eyes. Her still-short hair, although professionally styled now, fell over her forehead and brushed around her face. "Who are you and what have you done with my boyfriend?"

Draco smirked and stepped up next to the bed. "I can think of better things than work." He leaned down and brushed a kiss across her lips.

"I'm better than work?"

"Mmm," said Draco in agreement. He kneeled up on the bed so he could reach her lips better with his own. She wrapped her arms around his neck and returned his kisses.

Draco would have liked to go farther. He skimmed a hand under her shirt, just to feel the smooth skin on her stomach and reassure himself she was okay – and, if he was being honest, also because her skin was soft and he wanted to touch her – and then he pulled back and rolled over to flop beside her on the bed. He reached for the Parseltongue journal and ignored the frustrated look she gave him.

"They're your parents' rules," he said.

The rules were funny. When Arthur and Molly had sat Draco and Ginny down, and explained the rules, Draco had been torn between bafflement and hilarity. Sure – he logically knew that some parents had these rules, but being on the receiving end – and having Ginny turning scarlet from embarrassment next to him – had been quite the experience.

"I thought you were a Slytherin," Ginny said, the challenge in her voice.

Draco looked up at her speculatively. "That's true."

He dove in for another few kisses. This time both his hands slipped under her shirt. His fingers traced along the sides of her ribs. She squirmed a little, and huffed a laugh against his mouth – ticklish. He took the opportunity to delve deeper into her mouth, and then her hands were under his shirt. Her hands were hot and seared into his skin, up his chest, then down his back, gripping his shoulders, and then she pulled the shirt right off of him.

Draco was fine with that. He hitched up her shirt a little – not all the way off, just enough so he could lean against her and feel their skin together. She gasped; he groaned.

She pushed him back and he let himself be toppled over. She turned to stare at him – eyes tracing his face, then down his bare chest. He reached out to toy with a strand of her short hair.

"You're incredibly sexy," she said.

Draco raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"Mm-hm. Like a nine."

He rolled his eyes. "Not a ten?"

"Sometimes."

"Only sometimes?"

She nodded and then slid on top of him. "Do you want to guess when you're sexiest?"

"Definitely with you on top of me."

She shook her head and leaned down. "When you laugh."

And then her fingers dug into his sides at that worst possible spot, and he could help but jerk in response – and laugh – because it tickled – and she knew it. "Merlin – Ginny."

He tried to push her off – but she'd grown up with a house full of boys, and she had plenty of practice pinning victims down.

"Never going to stop," she said, fingers relentlessly pinching his sides – and it made him flinch and squirm and laugh in a way he never had before. "I'm going to make you laugh forever!"

And then he managed to flip her over – because he was trained in self-defense, and really, being tickled was not something Malfoys were that comfortable with – and she grinned up at him and kissed him. And kissing was good. Kissing was better than good, and much more acceptable than being tickled. Her hands dove into his hair, keeping his mouth right there, on hers, and her leg hitched up – her mostly bare leg, because she just has sleep shorts on, and that felt good too and –

"I believe there were ground rules set," said a voice from the doorway.

Draco rolled off Ginny onto his back – and it was a good thing his bed was as big as it was, or he'd be on the floor with the amount of rolling they'd both done. He looked over at Bill and sighed.

"Ugh, Bill," said Ginny, and there was a note of whining in her voice. Draco glanced at her. Her face was red. Embarrassed.

"Mostly that clothes stayed on," said Bill.

That was one of the rules that Arthur and Molly had set, but judging from the way Bill was frowning, they were his rules as well.

"That was my bad," said Ginny. She tossed Draco's shirt to him and he pulled it back on.

"I thought you were with Fleur," Draco said.

"I was, but then I got interrupted," said Bill, giving him a dirty look. "And then Lukas started crying, so I figured I'd torment you a little." Bill looked vindictively pleased.

Draco rolled his eyes, but then sat up straighter when he saw the stack of notebooks in Bill's hands.

"Are those?"

Bill plopped then onto the bed. "All of my transcripts of the site. You'll have to weed through it."

"That's fine," said Draco, already grabbing the first one.

"What happened to me being more important than work?" Ginny pouted.

Bill grinned. "I don't even need to put anti-locking charms on the doors. Best way to keep you two decent is give Draco work to do."

Draco looked up, a little affronted. "I can resist work," he said, but the temptation of having the notes right there, at his fingertips, was very enticing. Especially because Ginny was right there too. He grabbed a journal, sat back, and then patted the bed beside him.

Ginny stuck her tongue out at Bill, who laughed and left, closing the door behind him. Ginny huffed out a breath and then snuggled up next to him.

"If we get serious, I'm going to set rules about work in bed," she said.

Draco blinked, startled for a moment. He glanced down at her. "I am serious."

"No – like, marriage serious," said Ginny.

Draco paused for a moment.

"Oh, crap," said Ginny, and she sat up. "Did I just freak you out with the M word? I swear, I'm not thinking about it – I mean – sure, every girl does, but I'm not putting that pressure on us, or on you, and – what's that look mean?"

Draco didn't know what that look meant because he wasn't sure what his face was doing. He knew what his brain was doing. It'd stuttered for a moment. He put the notebook down. "So... I think a lot," he said.

"I've noticed that about you, yes."

Draco rolled his eyes at her, but then forced himself to forge on. "I've never been close with anyone, not my old girlfriends – at least, not the way I am with you. My brain likes numbers and possibilities and probabilities, and -,"

"You've already pictured us married!" Ginny exclaimed. She laughed, and then covered her mouth. "I swear, I don't mean to laugh at you. It's just – usually it's the girl who stereotypically gets far to invested in relationships."

Draco shrugged. "I have plans in my head. For every possibility." He licked his lips a little, and then looked at her. "I like the plans with you in them."

Ginny smiled and her cheeks flushed. "Are they good plans?"

"Very good plans."

"Are we compatible?"

"Nearly perfectly," said Draco, and he let his mind carry him through those future plans, after the end of the war they'd have careers and marriage – and maybe kids, but he'd have to be convinced, and there'd be travel and excitement, politics and businesses. A good sort of life. Happy.

Ginny smiled again, wider this time. She pressed a kiss on his forehead. "I love your brain."

"Well, it loves you too."

She snuggled back down again and he draped one arm over her shoulder. There was a matter of ending a war before he could start his future with her.

And yet, as she drifted off to sleep, and as he continued to read through notebook after notebook, he realized that the odds of starting that future any time soon were growing slimmer and slimmer.

OoOoO

Harry sighed and looked at his school trunk. He wondered if it was even worth packing because it seemed every time they were trying to get to Hogwarts, things were delayed. Getting Hogwarts repaired had pushed the return back. Then there was the attack on the train. And the sticking around while Ginny recuperated a little – not that everyone needed to stay back – it'd just sort of happened that way. It was nearly February now.

"Hey, Potter."

Harry turned, Draco was leaning in the doorway. "Don't tell me there's another delay?" he said, because Draco was decidedly not in his school uniform. He was wearing business robes over a suit. Originally the plan was that they'd all Floo to Hogwarts after breakfast.

"No, I just have a business thing to attend to real quick," said Draco. He shrugged a shoulder casually. "Might get to Hogwarts in the afternoon – or the day after."

Harry nodded and then looked back at his truck. He really should have packed last night then. A thought struck him, and he turned back to Draco. "Wait, what are you here for?"

Draco wasn't really one for social visits. He watched Draco shrug again, casually, and yeah, that was a danger sign because Draco was everything except casual. Harry set down the clothes in his hands and fully faced the Slytherin. "What's going on?"

Draco stepped fully into the room and shut the door. "Do you trust me, Potter?"

"Enough that you could call me by my first name," said Harry.

Draco smirked. "Harry, do you trust me?"

Harry thought about it, really thought about it. He thought about first learning who the real Draco was – not the snotty git who'd tormented him for six years – well, five really. He'd been halfway passable in the sixth year. He thought about Draco rescuing him from the Dursleys, and then beyond.

"Yes, I trust you."

Draco nodded once, decisively. "Then trust me now, Harry. You are the Boy-Who-Lived. You are the one that's prophesized about. Only you can kill Voldemort."

Harry paused for a moment. If this was important for Draco to tell him, then – "Could I not be the savior?"

"Did you just listen to a word I said?" Draco demanded, irritation in his voice.

"You just brought up the possibility that I can't kill Voldemort."

"No, I removed that possibility."

"Which meant it was a possibility to begin with," said Harry.

Draco sighed heavily and, in Harry's opinion, a tad bit theatrically. "Look, Potter," he started, but it sounded like deflection, and Harry was sick of people not telling him the truth.

"Who brought up that possibility?" he asked pointblank.

Draco shook his head. "It doesn't matter."

"It does to me."

Draco shook his head again, but Harry already knew the truth. "It was Dumbledore, wasn't it?"

Draco's eyes flickered a little in surprise. Harry was a little affronted. "I'm not stupid, Draco."

"You're not half-stupid," Draco allowed. "I just didn't think you'd want to be open to the possibility of Dumbledore not believing in you."

"I'm an orphan," said Harry. "I grew up in a cupboard under the stairs, in a rather unpleasant family, with only hand-me-downs to wear and never enough food to eat. Dumbledore's admitted he kept me there for my own protection, but he's the most powerful wizard in the world. You'd think at the very least he could have conjured me a sandwich every now and again."

It hurt to say the words out loud. Words that he'd been thinking for a while. Sure, Dumbledore had done his best to explain his reasoning, and yet Harry couldn't help but feel that his decisions had been based on treating Harry like a weapon, and not a child.

He watched Draco glance away for a moment. Really, the Slytherin was becoming increasingly easy to read.

"You don't have to feel sorry for me," he said.

Draco glanced back. "I don't feel sorry for you. I'm pissed off on your behalf."

"Oh," said Harry. So he'd misread that one then. "Well, thanks, I guess. But that doesn't change the fact that Dumbledore thinks I'm not longer the Chosen One. Why is that, by the way?"

Draco paused for a moment, but Harry had an inkling of suspicion on this as well. Draco's pause just confirmed it. "It's you, isn't it?"

"It's not me," said Draco quickly. "I mean, I am the one that Dumbledore thinks could save the world, but I'm not the chosen one."

"Are you just saying that because you don't want to be the chosen one?" Harry asked.

"Merde, Potter," Draco swore. "When did you become insightful?"

Harry grinned a little, because surprising the resident genius felt good. "I like to think people just underestimate me."

"Or maybe you play up the incompetence," said Draco, narrowing his gaze.

"I'm not Slytherin," Harry said. "So, tell me, why can't you be the chosen one."

Draco shook his head. "Because that's not the way this works."

"That seems vague."

"Maybe it is. Maybe it just makes sense. Occam's razor, Harry. Simplest solution. "

Harry didn't know what a razor had to do with anything, but he didn't like the way Draco was just glossing over any possibility that he could be the chosen one. "So you're saying you couldn't kill Voldemort," he challenged.

Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course I could kill Voldemort."

Harry opened his mouth, wanting to know what was taking so long then, if Draco was so sure he could kill Voldemort, but then Draco continued. "Anyone with nuclear launch codes could kill Voldemort, but then we're also taking out a big portion of England with the initial strike, not to mention the entire country, and probably Ireland as well, with nuclear fall out."

"Do you have nuclear launch codes?" Harry asked.

Draco gave one of his dramatic eye-rolls up to the heavens. "That's not really the point here. The point is, you're the only one who can kill Voldemort personally, wizard-to-wizard, without blowing up the entire country. So remember that. You're the Chosen One, no matter what anyone says."

Harry wasn't quite convinced. Draco gave him a dark look. "You said you trusted me."

"I do," said Harry.

"Then trust me on this. No matter what anyone says, no matter what reasons they give you, you're the Chosen one."

"What kind of reasons."

"Reasons that won't matter once I get through with them," said Draco, and there was a note of promised murder in his voice that made Harry a little nervous. "So, don't doubt yourself."

Harry laughed a little. "That's pretty much all I do."

Draco blinked once. "Really?"

Harry shrugged. "Huge crises," he said. "Getting bigger and longer each year. It took up nearly all of fifth year, now that I think about it."

"Huh," said Draco. "Well, stop it." He turned, his hand reached for the door, and Harry suddenly realized what was happening.

"How long are you going to be gone for?"

Draco turned back. "Just a -,"

"Don't say just a day, and don't say it's just business," said Harry. "I know a goodbye when I see it."

"You call this a goodbye?" Draco asked – and there he went, deflecting again.

"What are you doing?"

Draco shrugged. "Taking care of those reasons people will say you can't be the Chosen One."

"And it's going to take a while, isn't it?"

Draco sighed and leaned back against the door. "Yeah."

"Is it dangerous?"

Draco shrugged. "Probably."

"You don't have to do that for me."

'I'm not doing it for you, Potter," Draco said, and then he stopped and amended it, "Not just for you. You're the only one who can stop Voldemort. Voldemort is a threat to the world. So it's also for me."

"Yeah, but apparently it's really complicated."

"It's never not complicated," said Draco, and he turned to go again, but Harry stopped him. "Do you trust me?"

Draco turned once more. "Sure. You're the savior after all."

Harry let that go. "Say good by to Bill and Ginny."

He could immediately tell what Draco thought of that suggestion. His face screwed up ever so slightly.

"Trust me on this," Harry said. "I know more about relationships than you, and I definitely know more about Gryffindors. At the very least, write a letter."

Draco hesitated. "They'll get a note, saying I'm okay."

"Write a letter. To each of them. They deserve that."

Draco nodded. "Okay."

He turned for the door a third time

"Stay safe," Harry said.

Draco turned at the doorway. "Back at you, Potter. And remember, you're the chosen one."

Harry nodded. "I trust you."

He wasn't the only one who found the words somewhat amusing. Draco huffed a small little laugh. "Whatever is the world coming to?"

And then he turned and left. Harry looked back at his trunk, that still needed to be packed, and then back at the empty doorway. He wondered how long it'd take to see Draco Malfoy again.

OoOoO

And that concludes this story. All odds and ends will hopefully be wrapped up in... The End Code. Which will come out maybe at the end of summer. I want to make sure I have all my plot lines straight before starting - and I'd like to keep to a posting schedule as well.

So - please leave a review, let me know what you think, and thanks for sticking with me this far!

1. Four, or Rather, Five Years Gone

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did, I would take a vacation. To the seaside, I think.

Author's note: So - here it is. The final installment of the Code series. I think I have the general story fleshed out. Let's see if it ends up anywhere close to the outline, shall we?

OoOoOoOoO

Draco was being followed.

It wasn't the first time. Not that he remembered the first time. Or if the first time had been the only time.

He didn't remember much of anything.

But he was being followed now. At least, he was pretty sure he was. There was a knot in his stomach, a prickle on the back of his neck, and a shadow of someone out of the corner of his eye – and every time he tried to turn his head fast enough to see who it was, he saw no one.

Well, just a glimpse of red hair. Which could mean nothing at all.

But he still pulled up the hood of his sweatshirt, darted across the street without waiting for the crossing signal, and ducked down the nearest subway entrance.

New York City was enormous. There were plenty of people to get lost in, and Draco was deliberately living in the most densely populated area. He needed to stay hidden.

It was unfortunate, then, that he had such a distinctive appearance. He was pretty sure he was albino. No one was as pale as he was without some kind of genetic mishap. His skin and hair were practically white. His eyes were pale gray.

Disguises helped. He'd even dyed his hair on a few occasions, but the upkeep was too difficult. So knit caps and hoods helped him. And overlarge sweatshirts to hide the gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans.

He let the presence of the gun comfort him as he took four different subways and three different cabs to get back to his flat.

Apartment, not flat.

It was also unfortunate that he had a habit of slipping out with British terms and a British accent. While it gave him a vital clue to his identity, it made him noticeable. Americans liked British accents. They remembered them.

He reached his apartment and quickly unlocked the door. He slipped inside, shut the door, and then bolted it. Eight different bolts. All ones that he had installed himself.

He let out a little sigh, dropped his forehead against the door, and wondered why he didn't feel any safer. He turned around and immediately jumped back, his hand going to the doorknob.

The red-haired man was standing in the middle of his kitchen.

"Draco," the man said, a smile stretching over his face.

Draco pulled the gun from his waistband and thumbed the safety off. He raised it, holding it with two hands – just like all the instructions said, and aimed it at the man's chest. Center mass. Easiest target to hit. "Who the hell are you?"

The red-haired man paused, blinked, and then frowned. He didn't raise his arms, like most people did when they were confronted with a gun. He just looked confused. He gestured to himself.

"It's me. Bill."

He said it like Draco should remember him. "Who?"

"Bill," the man repeated. "Draco, what's going on?" He took a step forward, and there was an expression on his face that looked like concern.

Draco sidestepped into the kitchen so he could get a little more distance between them. "Why are you here?" he asked, trying to think of the fastest way to escape. The door was out. There were too many locks on the door to get out before the man stopped him, but he could probably get to the window and the fire escape.

"I got your compass," said Bill. He reached into his jacket.

"Stop! Hands where I can see them!" Draco snapped, feeling his heart start to race.

Bill did as he was told, but he was obviously confused. That was fine. Draco had been confused for the past four years – and it was nice not to be the only one befuddled.

"You sent me the compass," Bill said. "So I could find you. I just got it."

Draco paused. "When?"

"Three days ago," said Bill.

Draco lowered the gun a fraction of an inch. "Are you here for the code?"

"What code?"

Draco bit back a sigh of frustration. "The code I've been working on for the past four years."

Bill paused. "You finished your work three days ago?"

"Yes."

"It's possible the compass was spelled to be sent to me once you were finished," Bill said.

Draco tried to parse through his words, but couldn't quite figure out what he was saying. "The code's in there." He tipped his head towards the bedroom. Well, it wasn't really a bedroom anymore. He'd converted it into an office.

Bill didn't move.

Draco raised the gun again. "Why are you here?"

"Because I've been looking for you," said Bill. "Why wouldn't I be here?"

Draco shifted his grip on the gun. "Who are you exactly?"

Bill sighed a little and deflated. "I'm your friend, Draco."

Draco wanted to believe him more than he cared to admit. Four years of running. Four years of that damned code. Four years of not knowing what it was for, or who he was, or if anyone was missing him, had taken its toll. He was tired. He was lonely. He was frustrated. And in the late hours of the night, when he had nothing to distract him from the darker thoughts, he was scared.

So he asked the only question that would mean anything to him. "What's your full name?"

Bill frowned. "I don't-,"

"Your full name!" Draco snapped.

"William Arthur Weasley," Bill said.

Draco took in a sharp breath. That was the name in the journal. He lowered his gun so that it was pointing at the man's knee, not his chest. "And you know me?"

"Yes," said Bill, almost vehemently. "We're friends, I swear to Merlin, we're friends."

Draco tipped his head to the side. "Swear to Merlin? Is that a British thing?"

A strange expression crossed over Bill's face. "You're British too," he said slowly.

"Am I?" Draco asked. "Because I speak French, German, Italian, Spanish, Gaelic and Russian. And I speak them perfectly. I speak Mandarin and Farsi as well, and a good deal of Swahili and Urdu – but obviously I'm of European descent."

"French was your first language," said Bill. "And… apparently you've been learning new languages since we've last met."

"How long has that been?"

"Five years," said Bill.

"Five," said Draco. He frowned. "I thought I'd only been gone four."

"You seem to have forgotten a lot," said Bill.

"You don't seem concerned by that," said Draco. "Is it a Manchurian Candidate thing? Or Total Recall? Are you going to tell me that I'm a secret agent for the CIA – or should I say, MI-6? Maybe I'm the real James Bond?"

Bill looked a little thrown. "I'm not entirely sure what you're asking me."

"My memories," said Draco. "Is it some high-tech mind-wipe? An advanced drug? Or just plain, old fashioned brain trauma?"

Bill rubbed his head and winced. In fact, he was looking a little pale. He pulled out a cheap metal chair from Draco's cheap, fold-up card table that he used as a dining room table and sat down.

Draco finally thumbed the safety back on the gun and sat down across from him.

"How much have you forgotten?" Bill asked, a little faintly.

"If we start there we might be here a while," said Draco.

Bill nodded. "Okay. Let's start with what you do remember."

Draco nodded back. "My name is Draco. I'm translating a code. It needs to stay secret." He stopped. "That's about all I remember. I mean, a few things I've figured out."

Now Bill was looking as if he'd had a migraine. "What have you figured out?"

"I'm a genius," said Draco. "Every couple of months, I move cities, somehow, but I don't remember moving, and I don't remember where I was before the move. I've started writing it down – all the cities I've been in. I thought I was gone for four years, but you're telling me it's five. The code I'm working on is some sort of archaic language, a weird language, I can't find it anywhere on the internet. And it's resistant to computers. I mean, I learned coding and programming specifically so I could run algorithms on that thing, but it fritzes out any type of electronic that comes near it. I burnt through three smartphones already – just by being in the same room as the damn thing."

He stopped, because Bill was grimacing and rubbing his temples.

"You don't like what I'm saying."

"I don't like what you're not saying," said Bill.

"Which is?"

Bill looked at him. His eyes were warm, friendly, but there was a tightness around his eyes that made Draco a little scared. "Draco," Bill said slowly, "what do you know about magic?"

Draco frowned. "Like – slight of hand and illusions?"

"No. Actual magic."

Draco felt his face screw up in distaste. "Magic is just a term for things science can't explain yet. Quantum physics and unrealized rules of the universe – and now you're shaking your head at me. Why?"

Bill was shaking his head, but not just in disagreement. In despair as well.

"Draco," he said, and then he paused, took a breath, and looked him straight in the eye, "you're a wizard."

OoOoOoOoO

"Draco," Bill said, and then he had to pause and take a breath – because this should not be something that he had to reveal to one of the smartest wizards from one of the oldest wizarding families. He looked Draco in the eyes and said, "You're a wizard."

He watched Draco – this foreign Draco, that Bill was just realizing that he didn't know – digest his words. And then Draco threw back his head back and laughed.

Yes, this was not the Draco that Bill knew. He'd never seen Draco laugh so openly, or so heartily. Draco shook his head as he laughed, and then he looked back at Bill. "Okay, that was a good one. Seriously, you got me."

Bill just smiled a little, and waited for Draco to catch on. He did, quite quickly.

"Wait," Draco said. "You're serious?"

"Very," Bill confirmed.

"I'm not a wizard," said Draco. "I think I'd know if I was. I'd be… I don't know, pulling rabbits out of hats and making flowers appear, and whatever else wizards do."

"Those are Muggle magicians," said Bill. "You're a wizard." He reached into his jacket – noting the way that Draco stiffened, like he was expecting a weapon – and pulled out Draco's wand.

Draco had left his wand, and a letter, before he'd disappeared. Bill had kept them both since then, and now he placed the wand on the table. Draco eyed it, and then looked up at Bill.

"That's yours," Bill confirmed.

"What is it?" Draco asked, even though Bill knew he was smart enough to draw his own conclusions. So he simply gestured to the wand.

Draco looked at it, and then leaned in to study it more. He didn't touch it, not yet, obviously wary. "I thought wizards had staffs."

"We've upgraded," said Bill.

"But does it have unlimited data?" Draco asked, a faint hint of mocking in his voice, and Bill didn't get the joke, but Draco finally reached out for it and –

Fireworks.

Draco gave a surprised shout, and recoiled, dropping the wand back onto the table and nearly tripping over his chair to get away.

Bill took in the startled, aghast look on Draco's face, and couldn't help the burst of laughter that came out of his mouth. He'd never seen Draco so unabashedly startled. The Draco that Bill knew – the Draco with all his memories – would never have been so open with his emotions, but now his eyes were wide with surprise and fright, and his mouth was gaping.

"What the hell?" Draco demanded.

"You haven't used your wand in years," Bill said. "It's not uncommon for a wand to react the same way as when you first choose your wand."

"I have no idea what you're saying," Draco informed him, but curiosity was drawing him back towards the table. He knelt on the floor to stare at the wand from the same level. "So is it bio-incandescents? A chemical reaction?"

"It's magic," Bill said.

"I don't see any LEDs," Draco continued. "And I'm not seeing any seams – so it's not electronic. Is it solar-powered?"

"It's magic," Bill said again.

Draco reached out for the wand, hesitated for a second, and then grasped the wand again. A few small sparks shot out of the tip, and then it stopped, the initial reaction finished.

"It feels… slightly warm," said Draco. "And it… thrums a little."

"Magic," said Bill.

"Would you stop saying that?" Draco asked. And then he frowned at the wand. "Okay, how does this work? Motion activated?"

"You have to say a spell," said Bill, and he pulled out his own wand and flicked it through the air. "Lumos."

Draco audibly gasped as the light filled the room, and then, because he had perfect recall, flicked his own wand and cast the exact same spell. And then he tried to figure out where the light was coming from.

"Do I need to say it again?" Bill asked.

Draco looked at him. He shook his head. "Okay," he said, sounding a little shaken. "Magic."

OoOoOoOoO

So - I"m hoping to upload at least once every other week, hopefully once a week. We'll see what happens. Please review, and let me know what you think.





2. The Language of Snakes

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a very nice cup of tea - and am drinking it now while I post. Ahh...

Author's note: Wow! Such lovely reviews! And so many people have stuck around since the first story! I love you all and appreciate your kind comments.

OoOoOo

Five years ago...

Bill headed back into Malfoy Manor and found Fleur sitting in one of the many drawing rooms. She was actually using it for its named purpose, drawing. She had an easel set up, a host of colored quills, pencils, and pens beside her, and Lukas napping contently in a carrier by her feet.

"The children get off to school?" she asked, looking up from her work.

"All safe and sound," said Bill. "Well, Draco had some business to do, but it's not like his schoolwork will suffer for missing another day." He walked over to her side and laid a quick kiss on her lips. He let out a bit of sigh, content in the quiet that followed the absence of a multitude of teenagers, and then considered her sketch. It was a dress in purple, but beyond that, Bill couldn't say if it was an evening gown or a day dress. Fashion was not his strong suit.

"How long shall we stay, do you think?" Fleur asked.

"It is tempting to stay a while, isn't it?" Bill asked, taking the seat next to her and considering the room. He wondered if it would be possible to get used to such luxury, or if he would forever be surprised and pleased by it.

"I understand Draco is letting the Order use his home, but it feels… intrusive to stay while he is away."

"Agreed," said Bill. "I think my folks are planning on heading back to Grimmauld Place shortly. And we should probably see about our flat. I don't want to move back until it has a few more wards on it though."

Fleur sighed a little. "You are never happy with our wards."

"Curse breaker," Bill said. "Habit of the trade."

"Just because you can get through wards, does not mean everyone else can." Fleur picked up her pen and added some sort of bow to the dress. She considered the addition with a frown. Bill leaned in to kiss the frown away, but she pushed him back. "I have work."

Bill laughed a little, but stood to leave. "I'll find Mum. See what she says about packing. Maybe we'll hang out until tomorrow, in case Draco stops by after he's finished with whatever business he had."

Fleur nodded in agreement. Bill took a moment to kneel by his son, and stroke his cheek, but apart from rooting a little in his sleep, the baby didn't wake. Bill stood, and nearly stumbled over Tolly when the elf appeared with a small pop.

"A message for Mister William Weasley," he said, presenting a silver platter. A letter was sitting directly center on the polished surface. His name was on the front of the letter. It was Draco's handwriting.

"Thank you," said Bill.

The house elf disappeared again. Bill quickly unsealed the letter and began to read, a frown forming on his face as he read the contents.

Bill –

I'm writing to inform you that I'll be gone for a while. I can't tell you why I'm leaving, or where I'm going. Suffice it to say, it's important. And I would tell you if I could.

I haven't told anyone else that I'm leaving. Except for Potter. But he doesn't know the particulars either. He told me that I should write a letter – that you deserve that much. I suppose he's right. He's better at the 'friend' thing.

I don't know how long I'll be away. I'm hoping no more than a year. It might take two. Possibly it could take three. If it takes longer than that… well, either my work is getting the best of me, or something went wrong. I don't intend for things to go wrong, so I'm not about to turn this into a farewell or 'last wishes' type of drivel, which is better suited for melodramas. I just wanted to let you know that I was gone. And that I will miss your company.

Your friend,

Draco

p.s. I'm naming you temporary guardian for Malfoy Manor. Don't go too wild.

Bill re-read the letter, slower this time. Fleur put down her pencil.

"William?"

Bill shook his head, pulling his eyes from the letter onto his wife. "So… we might be staying a while," he said, and handed the letter over for her to read.

OoOoOoOo

Present Day...

Draco made a cup of coffee. Instant coffee. It was gross, to be sure, but it was quick and easy and he could make it as strong as he wanted. He grabbed some too-sweet coffee creamer from the fridge, because it was the only way the drink the foul-tasting stuff, and snagged a piece of cold pizza as well. He stuck the slice between his teeth while he stirred his coffee from black to pale beige.

He grabbed a paper towel to use as a plate, and then brought his dinner back to the table. Bill was watching him with something akin to revulsion on his face. Draco ignored him. He'd offered Bill a cup of coffee, but when Bill had seen the can of instant, he'd declined.

Draco took a bite of pizza, washed it down with the coffee, and said, "So, magic exists, but hidden from the 'Muggle' world, and right now there's a war going on in England and apparently I left for some unknown reason that should hopefully turn the tide of battle?"

"Yes," said Bill.

"And this 'Chosen One'-,"

"Harry Potter," Bill filled in.

Draco rolled his eyes a little – because he remembered the name, thank you very much – he was just using the title to show ridiculous this was, "is prophesized to destroy 'the Dark Lord'-,"

"Voldemort," Bill said.

Draco rolled his eyes again. Same concept. "But, you haven't, I don't know – just stuck them in a boxing ring together, maybe an MMA cage, and let them duke it out?"

Bill looked a thrown by the slang. "I think I know what you're asking. But yes – or rather, no. When Harry and Voldemort have faced each other in battle, it's… it's like a stalemate. Neither of them have been able to kill each other."

"And you think that's what I was working on," said Draco. "Finding a way that they can kill each other?"

"I think you knew about this problem before we even started," said Bill.

"And you think the code can help?"

"That's my guess."

"Okay," said Draco. He was pretty sure he'd wrapped his head around the gist of the story. "You want to see the code?"

Bill nodded, emphatically. "Yes."

Draco took his coffee mug and pizza with him. He led Bill into the bedroom that he had turned into an office. There were papers everywhere. Some crumpled on the floor, some in stacks, some tacked to the walls. There were books as well, language books and reference books and archaic scrolls, and a great deal of math books – primarily focused on statistics and algorithms.

The only neat area of the room was the desk, and that was only because everything that had been on the desk had been swept off to leave room for one journal.

It was a tattered journal now, but the cover was a good-quality of leather that had held together, and the paper was thick enough not to tear. It was stuffed full of pages ripped from other notebooks and notes scribbled on napkins and old receipts.

"That's Harry's Parseltongue journal," Bill said.

"Sorry, a what?" Draco asked around a mouthful of pizza.

Bill blinked at him, like he was more startled at his bad manners than the fact that Draco didn't know what the journal was. Draco shrugged. He was a young male, living alone. What did he expect?

Bill stepped forward and opened up the journal. Draco had perfect recall, so he knew what Bill was looking at on the first page. Even if he hadn't had perfect recall, he'd stared at the instructions long enough to have them ingrained in his mind.

"Your name is Draco. When you read this, you will not know who you are. You will not know who your family is. You will not know where you're from, or where you are going. And I can't tell you what happened or why this was necessary.

"Understand that this was the absolute last option available. If you want to remember who you are, if you want to remember anything, then you must decipher the code.

"But you aren't safe. Not completely. There will be people who want to code – who want you. Keep this book. It will protect you. This book is the only thing that will stay with you, so use it wisely.

"Trust only William Arthur Weasley. He is a friend."

Bill looked up from the book. His face was pale and he looked shaken. "Draco," he said, and then stopped, like he wasn't sure what to say.

Draco shrugged. "It took a while to realize that every couple of months I'd wake up in a different city, and that the book was the only thing that traveled with me. I had to keep all of my notes in it, all the work I'd done, or I'd lose it."

He finished his pizza, and then drained his coffee mug. "I kept a few notes for myself in the back, just things I learned."

Bill flipped to the back pages, and again, Draco knew what he was looking at, hastily jotted sentences, or sometimes cautiously written lines of inferences he'd made about himself.

"I'm in Boston. I don't think I've always been here."

"I don't know why I don't remember."

"I have a British accent – maybe I'm British?"

"I'm in Moscow. I think I'm moving – but I don't remember how."

"I'm good with languages."

"I speak very good French. Sometimes I think in French. Am I French?"

"Math comes easily to me."

"I remember everything."

"I'm in Quebec now."

"I think I might be a genius – or narcissistic for thinking that if it's not true."

"I'm definitely a genius."

"I can't remember anything before this. I don't even know if I have a family."

"I don't know if anyone's looking for me."

Bill closed the book. "We didn't look for you – not at first."

Draco frowned. "What do you mean?"

"You told us you were going away for a little while, and that it was necessary. Well, you told us in a letter, one for me, and one for Ginny."

Draco stood up a little straighter. "Ginny?" He fished a necklace out of his shirt. It was long enough to pull over his head. The chain was simple silver, and the ring that was hung on it was plain as well, but it was made out of platinum. He handed it over to Bill, who tipped it to read the inscription inside, just one word, 'Ginny'.

"What's it short for?" Draco asked. "Virginia? Regina? Ginnifer?"

"Ginevra," Bill corrected.

Draco screwed his face up slightly, because that was not a name he'd ever considered. "Ginevra," he repeated. He waited for the word to strike something in him, to bring some memory into focus, but nothing happened. He shook his head. "Are we married?"

Bill spluttered a little. "Married?"

Draco narrowed his eyes slightly. That was a bit of an over-reaction from the red-haired man, wasn't it? He shrugged. "It looks like a wedding ring."

Bill opened his mouth to say something, then closed it, and his face turned a little red. Draco laughed, pinning his odd response then. "Don't tell me," he said. "She must be your sister."

"My baby sister," said Bill. "You'd better not be married – sixteen! She was sixteen when you left, Draco!"

Draco raised his hands in a placating gesture. "I have no idea what happened. Just asking. You have a problem with us, or something?"

"No," said Bill. "Just…,"

Draco shook his head. "Whatever, so the journal? You going to tell me what it is, and why it's so important that I spent five years of my life, with no memories, working on it, and no one bothered looking for me?"

"We did look for you," Bill corrected. "Just not at first." He sighed a little, and rubbed his face. "Look, you know you're a genius."

"Yes."

"Well, you often got it in your head to do things, sometimes crazy things, and you were seventeen, and an adult -,"

"Wait – what?"

"Seventeen's an adult in the wizarding world," Bill explained. "So, when you left, we couldn't really do much about it." He sighed a little. "And in your letter, you said it might take a couple of years, maybe even three years. And so it took us a while to get nervous. Towards the middle of the third year, we started sending out searchers, tried tracking you, and tried getting help from the Ministry. Kingsley's still in office, and he helped some… but then, things got bad."

That was an ominous line.

"What things?" Draco asked.

"We lost Grimmauld Place as headquarters," said Bill. "And then we started losing people. Remus was the first - or nearly so. He's still in the incurable ward."

Draco didn't know who Remus was. Or what Grimmauld Place was, but it was obvious Bill was shaken.

"And then… then was the battle for Hogwarts. We lost Dumbledore in that battle, and after losing him… we couldn't hold onto Hogwarts, either." Bill shook his head. "And then, it was like the tide turned. We lost Wizengamots – well, it shut itself up after the Death Eaters attacked, and half of St. Mungo's was destroyed. We lost people too. Ted and Andromeda. McGonagall. And then when the coup was attempted…," Bill stopped. He blinked and cleared his throat. "We lost the Ministry building, and nearly the Ministry itself, and during the attack, we lost Charlie."

Bill turned away, and scrubbed a hand over his eyes.

Draco waited for a moment, not knowing what to say, but feeling somewhat awkward in the knowledge that he should know what it meant, that he should feel something. But he didn't.

"I don't know what any of that means," he said. Bill turned back, something hurt in his expression even though his eyes were understanding. Draco shrugged. "I don't know who those people are, or what those places are."

Bill stepped forward to clap a hand on his shoulder. "I know. Maybe that's why… maybe that's why I'm telling you this now."

"Charlie," said Draco. "He's a family member of yours?" He had to be, with the way Bill reacted.

Bill nodded. "He was second oldest, after me. None of us… well, after Percy left home… it feels like we've been cut in half somehow. We used to be such a big family, and now, we're pretty close to average. It feels… smaller." He shook his head. "But all of us have lost someone by now."

Draco wanted to ask, 'What about me? Have I lost anyone?' but Bill hadn't talked about his family, and Draco was pretty sure he could guess what that meant.

"So – the code," he said, redirected the conversation. "What's it for? How does it work?"

Bill hesitated.

Draco realized what the hesitation meant. "Are you shitting me?"

OoOoOoOo

Draco swore. "Are you shitting me?"

He was indignant. Bill would be too, if he'd just wiped his memories and spent five years of his life deciphering a code, only to find out no one knew what it meant.

"You didn't even tell us why you were leaving," Bill said, trying to make Draco understand why he was so flummoxed. Draco liked keeping secrets, and he wasn't always good at communicating what he was doing, or why he was doing it. "And I didn't even know what you were working on until now."

"But you recognized it," said Draco.

Bill nodded and picked the journal up. "Harry gave you this, as a bit of a 'thank you' after you saved the life of his godfather. It's a Parseltongue journal, the language of the snakes. You're the only person cocky enough to think you can learn it, instead of being born with the ability to speak it."

Draco rolled his eyes. "Okay, is it a magical world you live in, or is it Disney? Talking animals, now? Really?"

"Just snakes," said Bill. "And not all of them."

And now Draco looked downright testy. "Are there actual rules in this universe of yours, or are you just making it up as you go along?"

Bill couldn't help but laugh a little, because that was very much the Draco he knew. Draco narrowed his gaze, looking offended at his laughter, and that was very much Draco as well.

"Sorry," said Bill. "It's just… you sound a lot like yourself right now."

Draco muttered something under his breath, but Bill ignored him in favor of flipping through the journal.

"No wonder you fried your computers," he mused. "Magic and technology don't get along – but this… this is really old magic here. This is…," he stopped, because the end of the code – he remembered those symbols. He'd studied those symbols, and so had every curse breaker since the 1600s. "Draco, do you know what you did?"

Draco spread his palms. "Not a fucking clue. Memory loss, remember?"

Bill disregarded the irritation in his voice. "You decoded the Merlin tomb. The Merlin tomb. It's… it's gone unsolved since it was first discovered, and you… you realized it was Parseltongue. The language of the snakes. They had a written language!"

"That's just stupid," said Draco, crossing his arms. "They don't even have hands; how can they write?"

Bill jumped forward, ignoring the way Draco stiffed, and pulled him into a crushing hug. "This is amazing! Draco – I can't even fathom how you did this – this is astounding."

Draco sighed a little, and Bill stepped back quickly. "Sorry. You and your personal space issues."

"I have personal space issues?"

"You can be a little… prickly," Bill said. "But seriously, this is the discovery of the century!"

"Great, cool, awesome," said Draco, and he sounded anything but excited. "But now that you know what it is, do you know what it's for?"

Bill looked at the notebook, looked at Draco, then back at the notebooks. He shook his head. "I still don't know what it's for."

Draco threw up his hands in exasperation. "Is there anything you do know?"

He was frustrated, and angry. And again, Bill completely understood that. So he closed the journal and said, "Your name is Draco Lucius Malfoy."

That caught Draco's attention. He looked at Bill.

"You're twenty-two years old as of June," Bill continued. "You're a genius with perfect recall, you play piano, you're something of a know-it-all, and you saved my life in your sixth year at Hogwarts."

Draco leaned back against the door frame, looking a little less annoyed.

"We're going to figure this out," Bill promised.

OoOoOoO

So - a few questions answered about what happened during those five years, and a whole lot more questions to go. Please leave a review!





3. Going Home

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a gym membership, which, after Thanksgiving, probably needs to be utilized way more than it is right now, lol.

Author's Note: Bit of a wait for this chapter, apologies. It's a little longer than the others. Plus, Thanksgiving. So for all of you who celebrate, I hope you had a lovely time filled with good food and even better company. And for those who don't, I still hope you had a good weekend. I am thankful for all of you readers, who are so encouraging and supportive. Thanks!

OoOoOoOo

Portkeys.

Portkeys were like teleporters.

There were teleporters in the world, and Draco had no idea they even existed.

In fact, Bill said that the Parseltongue journal was probably a Portkey, and was spelled to keep Draco moving from crowded city to crowded city.

He had said a few other things too, like that it might have been necessary for Draco to move so frequently to avoid detection, but Bill didn't seem entirely sure of what he was saying – like he was making an educated guess, and trying to convince Draco that it was fact.

But still – teleporters!

Or rather, Portkeys. Draco had to completely re-think about the world, and the rules he had thought governed the world. If people could teleport, did that mean they could fly?

Draco looked over at Bill. He was asleep, curled up a little in the train seat, obvious exhaustion written on his face. In fact, most of the passengers on the train looked exhausted. England was in bad shape – financial troubles, weather troubles, food troubles, health troubles, and crime troubles.

If there was some sort of underground war going on, it made sense. At least, Draco could come up with plausible reasons why a secret society having a civil war could create havoc in the larger, host community, but he didn't know if the reasons were accurate, or just guesses. He wanted to ask more questions – he wanted to ask a million of questions, but Bill looked tired. And he was sleeping.

So Draco looked out the window because apparently this was home and tried to find anything familiar. Nothing sparked his memory.

They trained into London, and then took a cab to a generic sort of street. They stopped outside a pub called the Leaky Cauldron – and really, that seemed a little obvious, didn't it?

Draco paid for the taxi. In fact, he'd paid for the train as well, because Bill didn't seem to have a whole lot of 'Muggle' currency, and Draco had a well-stocked credit card. He followed Bill into the pub, a little warily.

Bill looked wary too. As soon as he stepped into the pub, he drew his wand. He scoped the place out, a careful look from left to right, and then back again. Apparently satisfied, he moved towards the back. Draco followed, a little slower, taking stock of the pub and the customers. The pub was dimly lit, and it looked like it hadn't been refurbished in several years. The tables and chairs were worn, a little crooked and warped from use, and dinged up in more places than not. The customers were mostly silent and huddled in their booths, their gazes mostly aimed at the floor.

Bill stopped Draco at the back door. "Wait here."

He left, the door swinging shut behind him, and Draco paused, feeling a little uncertain and oddly exposed. One of the customers, a man huddled in a dark coat, looked up from his pint and glanced at Draco. His gaze widened, and he stared a little, and then cast around, as if he was looking to see if anyone else was seeing Draco.

Draco turned away, uncomfortable at the attention, and then for a lack of anything better to do, walked up to the bar.

The bartender was wiping down the counter, keeping his gaze low, just like the other customers, as if looking at the wrong person was a death sentence. He only looked up when Draco slid onto a stool, and then he started.

"Mr. Malfoy," he said, obvious surprise in his voice.

Draco blinked, also surprised. This man knew him?

"Haven't seen you in a while," said the man, putting down his cloth.

Draco didn't quite know what to say, so he simply gave a nod. "I've been away."

"Whereabouts?"

"The States," said Draco.

The man picked up a clean mug and poured fresh coffee into it. He then stared a little at Draco.

"Work or pleasure?"

Draco was hit with a strange sense of déjà vu. "Work – mostly."

The man poured in cream, a little sugar, and a splash of whiskey. He placed it on the counter in front of Draco.

Draco took it, sipped it, and smiled. "This is exactly what I needed."

"Rough day?" the man asked, continuing to wipe down the bar.

"Rough couple of months," said Draco. "And before that, I think it's been a rough couple of years."

"It's been going around," said the man, and then his gaze latched onto something behind Draco and he flinched.

Draco whirled around just in time to avoid a bright red light. It shot over his shoulder instead, and hit the shelves behind the bar. Glass bottles exploded.

Magic, Draco thought, even as he grabbed his barstool and flung it at the man standing in the middle of the room. He'd been a customer, one of the pair in the far corner, but he was dressed differently now. He was wearing a black robe with a hood.

The man flicked his wand, and the barstool – which had been hurtling towards his head – was whipped to the side and splintered on the wall.

Magic, Draco thought again.

And then the man's friend got up, and his clothes changed as well, morphing into a similar dark robe and hood. He slashed his wand, and Draco leapt up and over the counter.

A blue curse shot over the top of the counter. Draco ducked low as more glass shattered and threw up his arm to protect his face. Glass shards peppered him. He turned his head and saw the bartender huddled in the corner as well.

"I can't help you," the barkeep said. "I have to stay neutral. You understand."

Draco didn't understand. He didn't understand a lot of what was happening, but he could adapt.

This was a magical battle. Draco didn't know any battle spells, but Bill had shown him a few tricks. Lumos for light. Nox for dark. Wingardium leviosa to move objects. It appeared a lot of spells had a Latin base, and Draco knew Latin.

He pulled out his wand and gripped it tight. He hoped this worked.

There was a break in the spells. Draco jumped up, wove his wand, and yelled out, "Ventus!"

A huge gust of wind tore from his wand. Draco could see the ripple of the spell as it flung out across the pub, picking up chairs and tables, as well as the two attackers, and one stray customer that hadn't run out with the rest. It threw them all against the back wall, which cracked under the force of the spell.

Draco stared for a moment, stunned at the result, and more than a little surprised that it had worked, and then Bill ran in, wand drawn. He skidded to a stop when he saw the damage, and then he turned to Draco. He let out a choke of laughter. "Only you, Draco," he said, shaking his head.

Draco looked back down at the wand in his hand. "Apparently this will take some finesse." He put it back into his jacket pocket, a little unnerved.

There was a tinkle of glass as the bartender stood and surveyed the pub.

"I assume you can bill me for the damages," Draco said, and then, "I also assume that I can pay for them."

He shook a few remaining pieces of glass from his clothes, and then walked around the bar, rather than jumping over it. "I also assume we should get out of here?" he asked Bill.

Bill held up a brick triumphantly. "Found the Portkey, and it was only slightly booby-trapped."

Draco didn't quite know what that meant, but Bill held it out to him. "Hold on."

Draco reached out and took hold of the brick, and then they were Portkeying again, a truly uncomfortable sensation of someone hooking him and yanking him backwards, and then he was falling through space, and then he was simply falling backwards.

He hit thick green grass that was warmed by the sun.

He sat up.

There was a very large manor that was stretched out before him. It was constructed of gray stone so pale it looked silver in the sun. It was several stories high, and sprawled out in several different directions, as if someone had started building, and then didn't know when to stop. The architecture was intricately detailed and ornate.

A soft breeze blew across the large lawn, bringing the pleasant scent of flowers and freshly tilled earth. Draco could see the upkeep of a rather large vegetable garden on the side of the manor.

"Welcome home," said Bill, gesturing at the mansion. "We've set up headquarters here. Hope you don't mind."

He started for the house, leaving Draco to wonder why the hell he should care where their headquarters were set up? Also, were people living at headquarters? Did he live at Headquarters?

Didn't he have a home?

He pushed himself to his feet and followed after Bill, who was heading towards the main doors. "Are we still in England?" he asked. "Isn't it a little… hot?" London had been gray and cold, cold enough for a jacket. In fact, all of England had been unseasonably cold for the summer. The news stated it had broken records.

"The manor and grounds have weather charms," said Bill.

Draco canted his gaze up, and then turned a quick circle, trying to tell if the wards were visible. They weren't. But he did see what looked like a rather large stable across the lawn, and there were several gardens dotted throughout the carefully kept grounds. Not like the vegetable garden to the side of the manor, which looked like almost amateur, but flower gardens with carefully cobblestoned paths leading up to fountains and sculptures.

He jogged a few steps to catch up to Bill. "I can't help but think that this is a little obvious for a Headquarters. It's so… big. And exposed. And… well, obvious."

"Oh, absolutely," said Bill. "The Death Eaters know where we are, but the wards here are too strong for them."

"Yes, but you said you'd lost other places. The Ministry and Hogwarts, and I'm assuming those had wards as well."

"Yes, but they were also infiltrated by Death Eaters. It's easy to take down wards if you have someone on the inside. We're a little more discerning about who we let in here. Don't worry." Bill turned and shot him a smile. 'We kept it safe for you."

Safe for him? That was an odd way of wording it, but before Draco could ask what he meant, the main doors flew open and a woman ran out. She looked to be middle aged, or slightly past, and she was also slightly frazzled looking. She had Bill's red hair.

"Oh, sweet Merlin!" she exclaimed.

Draco slowed his steps, expecting the woman to run to Bill, but she headed straight for him, and then suddenly he was caught up in her arms.

"Oh, you're alive! You're alive and safe!" she babbled, squeezing him tight. Her arms were soft, but also strong. She smelled like apples and vanilla. And then she pulled back and cupped his cheeks. "And look at you!" She petted his hair, and patted his cheeks, and hugged him again, tears choking up her words. "You're here. You're safe. We were so worried!"

This was obviously not his mother. They looked nothing alike – and yet, Draco knew that this was how mothers greeted their children after they had been gone for long periods of time, and it felt good to know that he was missed, and that he was welcomed back, so he returned the hug and basked in the attention. It felt good to be cried over, and for his face to be patted, and to receive all her smiles.

She finally stepped back, tears in the corners of her eyes. "I swear you must have grown since I've seen you! And you're more handsome than ever! Just look at you!"

Draco felt his cheeks go red. He ducked his head in embarrassment, glancing up to give her a rather bashful grin. But then her face went cold. She suddenly had her wand in hand, and it was pointed at his chest.

Draco took a hasty step back, all happiness forgotten. What had happened? Was she actually a Death Eater?

"Bill," she said, voice clipped. "Who did you bring back?"

Bill stepped between them, and placed a gentle hand on hers, lowering her wand. "It's Draco."

"That's not Draco," said the woman, still staring at him with that cold expression on her face.

"It's Draco," Bill insisted. "It's just Draco without any memory."

The woman paused. "What?"

"He doesn't remember us. He doesn't remember anything. He's been completely wiped."

"Death Eaters?" the woman asked, her expression falling from cold to concerned.

"No," Bill said. "I think… I think he did it to himself, but naturally he has no idea why or how."

And now the woman looked horrified. "Oh, you poor dear," she said, and then she reached out for him, expression warm, but Draco jerked back, unsettled.

Her expression softened even further, but she didn't look offended. If anything, she smiled at him, fondly. "Well, don't you worry. We'll figure it all out. For now, we'll get you a cup of tea. And how about a sandwich? You must be hungry."

And she gestured for them to follow her into the house, but she moved so quickly that she'd completely disappeared by the time they reached the front doors, and then Draco had to stop and stare.

The front entry, it was… well, it was grand. It was huge and marble and gold and utterly opulent. Draco turned in a circle, trying to take it all in, and then noticed that Bill was watching him with an expectant sort of expression.

"Well?" Bill asked.

Draco didn't quite know what to say to that. "It's… nice?"

He didn't quite get why Bill burst into laughter, but then there was clatter on the stairs and two young men appeared. One had red hair and freckles, obviously another of Bill's family, and the other had dark messy hair, green eyes, and a scar on his forehead.

"Harry Potter," Draco said, because he remembered the description.

"Draco Malfoy," Harry returned with an easy sort of grin. "You've been away awhile. Glad you're back."

"Thanks," said Draco.

Bill clapped him on the shoulder. "I'm going to say hello to the wife. But find me when you're done catching up." And then, grinning a little wickedly, he headed down the front hall. Draco turned back to the other two.

"Oh, man," said the red-head. "My sister is going to kill you."

"Sorry, what?" Draco asked.

"You've been gone five years," said the red-head. "Five years. What the hell have you been doing?"

"Translating the Merlin tomb, or so I'm told," said Draco. He stuck his hands in his pockets, not quite knowing what else to say. He rocked back on his heels. "What have you two been up to?"

"What have we been up to?" the red-head demanded, tone incensed. "What the bloody hell do you think we've been doing?"

"Ron," said Harry in a reproving tone. He reached out and placed a hand on his shoulder, but the red-head, Ron, shrugged him off.

"We've been fighting a war! We've been fighting battles and saving lives and you asked what we've been up to? Where the hell have you been?"

"New York City, most recently," said Draco. "Before that, Toronto, Moscow, Seattle, Sydney, Boston, Chicago, Berlin, and -,"

"Well, maybe we should all go on vacations while the bloody world is ending!" Ron exploded.

"Ron Weasley," scolded a female voice. Draco looked up to a see a woman with thick curly brown hair descend the stairs. "You could at least ask what he was doing in a those cities before assuming it was for pleasure." She looked at Draco and smiled. "I am glad to see you. We were all worried that perhaps – well, perhaps you had been killed."

"No, still alive," said Draco. He spun around to survey the entryway once more, because it was really that grand, and then turned back to the three. "So…," he said.

Harry raised his eyebrows. Ron tipped his head to the side. The woman frowned. "Are you feeling okay?"

Draco shrugged a shoulder. "Hard to say. The trip here wasn't bad, but it's all a little…,"

"Hard coming home?" the woman asked, sympathetically.

And Draco didn't know if he'd use that word to describe a war headquarters, but he shrugged again, rocked back on his heels, and forced a pleasant smile. "Sure, something like that."

The woman paused. Ron reached for his pocket where his wand was sticking out. Harry's was already in his hand.

Draco took a step backwards.

"You aren't really Draco, are you?" Harry asked.

Draco narrowed his gaze, feeling slightly irritated. "You tell me."

"Is it polyjuice?" the woman asked. "Some sort of shape-shifter?"

"Shape shifter?" Draco asked. "You have… there are… shape shifters? Really?"

"Your cousin's a shape-shifter," said Ron. "What are you playing at?"

Draco raised his hands in a helpless gesture and dropped them again. "Apparently I'm playing a very bad game of catch-up."

"How do you now remember metamorphmagi?" the woman asked.

"Imperius curse," said Ron, drawing his wand.

"That wouldn't make him stupid," said the woman.

"Not stupid," Harry corrected. "Memory loss. You have no idea who we are."

Draco flashed him a quick grin. "You're sharp." He pointed at Harry. "You're Harry Potter." He looked at Ron. "Red-hair and pale and freckles. You must be a Weasley." He looked at the woman. "No idea who you are."

"You don't remember Hermione?" Ron spluttered.

"If he didn't remember his own cousin, he's not going to remember me," said Hermione. She held out her hand. "Hermione Granger."

Draco shook her hand. "Draco Malfoy. But you already knew that. Nice to meet you, or should I say, meet you again. I don't remember the first time."

He stepped back and did another turn around the entryway, because he kept noticing new things – like the chandelier. Was it actually crystal? And was it really gold, or just gold overlay? Surely some of it must be glass, or else the whole thing would be worth… well, it hurt Draco's head to think about it.

"This is a ridiculous place to have a Headquarters during a war," he said, and then turned back to the other three. They were looking at him rather oddly.

"That's why you're acting so bloody weird," Ron breathed out.

"Weird?" Draco asked.

Ron stepped forward and poked him in the shoulder. "It's like… it's like you're a real person."

Draco batted his hand away. "Of course I'm real. What the hell does that mean?"

"How much memory did you lose?" Hermione asked. "What happened? Was it a memory spell? Was it Death Eaters?"

Draco shrugged. "I know my name is Draco. And Bill filled me in on the whole - ," he wriggled his fingers in the air – "magic thing."

"Oh, Merlin," Ron groaned.

"That's… alarming," Hermione said.

Harry said nothing, but his face tensed. Draco watched his jaw work, and then Harry forced a smile on his face "Well, I'm sure we'll figure it out, right?"

Draco smiled back. "Sure, why not?"

No one felt comforted.

OoOoOoOoO

Severus strode through the manor, silently cursing the fact that it was so inefficiently large. He had to ascend from the dungeons, where his potions were brewing, walk through the entire East Wing, which was functioning as the temporary housing for displaced families of Order members, and then passed through the grand entryway and into the informal dining room.

His eyes swept the room. Bill was there, as well as Molly Weasley and the three Gryffindor golden students. And there, at the table eating a sandwich, was Draco Malfoy.

The pressure that had been building in his chest for every year Draco was gone eased slightly. Severus let out a breath. "So pleased you've deigned to return to the fold, Mr. Malfoy," he drawled, and continued into the room.

Draco looked up. "Uh, thanks, I guess."

Severus stopped, and then his wand was out and leveled at the impostor. "This is not Draco Malfoy."

The impostor dropped his sandwich back onto his plate. "Seriously? You too?"

"Severus, it's okay," Bill said.

Severus wanted to say it wasn't okay, because he knew Draco, and that wasn't him, but the impostor spoke up first.

"Okay?" he demanded, with far too much expression in his voice. It was easy to pick out the emotions, exasperation, irritation, and confusion. "Okay? How is it that I can be perfectly normal, even polite, and suddenly people are threatening me with wands? What the hell? Why does no one think I am who I am?" He pushed off from the table and stood. His hands were clenched by his sides. "Is there a code word I should be saying? Should I be speaking a different language? I know a whole bunch."

Severus lowered his wand. He studied the young man. It was Draco's form; he was sure of it. But none of his mannerisms. He was too normal, too expressive, almost as if he'd never been indoctrinated in Pureblood society.

"Ah," he said, reaching the correct conclusion. He lowered his wand. "You appear to be missing vital memories of your childhood, Mr. Malfoy."

"He's missing all of his memories," said Bill.

"I remember most things, if you want to get technical," Draco bit back, and yes, that was Draco. "I remember several languages, the physical principles of the world, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and a whole lot more. And yet, apparently, I'm not myself."

"You're too expressive," Severus told him. "The Draco we are familiar with is much more… contained."

"Frigid," Ron chimed in over him.

"Ron!" Hermione hissed, and then to Draco. "You're usually a little more… well, civil. And… aloof."

Severus watched the interplay of emotions of Draco's face. It was startling to see how easy he could read him now.

"I do hope your memory loss doesn't also encompass why you felt the need to leave for five years?" Severus asked, claiming a seat at the table and accepting a cup of tea from Molly.

His question was met with silence. Severus sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. He could feel a headache starting to bloom. He looked back up at the table. He was, not for the first time, startled to see that people were looking at him. No, not at him, to him. Ever since Dumbledore died, he'd been the de facto head of the Order. The reluctant, de facto head. Thankfully, and Merlin knew that this was a strange thing to be thankful for, but thankfully Potter had done a good deal of stepping up. Him and Bill Weasley, who had a decent brain in his head.

"Well, it goes without saying that the first mission is getting Draco his memory back," Severus said.

"Agreed," said Bill.

"The first question is, why did you go away in the first place?" Severus turned to Draco.

Draco groaned and dropped his head onto the table. "I don't know!"

"Second question," Severus followed up with, steadfastly ignoring the theatrics. "Where have you been?"

Draco picked his head up. "Where haven't I been?" he asked, and then shook his head. "Actually, before we even do this, is this everyone? I do not want to keep repeating myself over and over again, and I'd really like not to have people threaten me with magic and hocus pocus and whatever else simply because I'm openly expressing my state of confusion and frustration."

There was something derisive about the way he referred to magic that had Severus's expertly honed instincts screaming that this was trouble.

"Hocus pocus?" Molly asked.

"Ah, about that," Bill said. "So, when I found him, he didn't know what magic was."

There were a couple of shouts from those at the table. Draco thunked his head down on the table again, narrowly missing his sandwich. Severus considered all the ramifications of the fact that Draco, mastermind, skilled dueler, dark magic expert, and perhaps one of the greatest threats to Voldemort in the war, had no idea what magic was, and considered thunking his head onto the table as well. Except someone would need to keep all of their brain cells functioning and not give into theatrics, and it looked like it'd have to be him.

"Call an emergency meeting," he said.

OoOoOoOo

Please leave a review! I will hope to get another chapter up by next weekend.





4. Meeting the New Order

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. If I did... well, that'd be awkward. Considering I'm re-writing all the major plot points. And killing off characters.

Author's note: So... I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep up with weekly updates. As I'm writing, my chapters are getting longer and longer. The first chapter was two thousand words, the second was three thousand, the third was four thousand. And this one is five thousand words. I will try though. Because it'll keep me on track. And I feel I owe it to all of you for making you wait so long in the past...

oOoOoOoOoOo

One year ago...

Ginny nearly walked by the letter.

She was home late from work, and it had been a hard day. They'd lost the case against a group of young Death Eaters who had tormented and assaulted a young Muggle-born witch. Well, not lost it, per se. The young men had been convicted of assault, but not malicious assault. If she and Preston had been able to prove that these young men had been Death Eaters, then the sentence would have been five times as severe. But the judge had ruled in favor of the defense. He had determined that these young men were not really Death Eaters. They had just been drinking too much. They were guilty of bad judgment, but nothing more malevolent. Because this was their first offense, they had been sentenced to probation and community service. Nothing more.

It was a difficult blow. And it proved that the Death Eaters were getting smarter. They weren't Marking their new recruits. They were keeping their meetings and doctrine silent. They were hiring lawyers to get convictions on smaller crimes, and even taking plea deals to avoid getting a convicted of hate crimes.

It was disheartening, and Ginny planned on taking a very long, very hot shower. And then she wanted a home-cooked meal and a glass of wine. And then bed. With this plan in mind, she nearly walked straight passed the letter, but then stopped, and turned.

The letter was propped up on her vanity along with the rest of the day's mail. This letter had only her name written on the front, no sender address, but she knew whose handwriting that was. She had read and re-read the letter Draco had left her, four years ago, when he had first gone missing. She had memorized every word and every letter, and now here was another.

She crossed over to the vanity and picked the letter up with trembling fingers. Hope flared in her chest, bright and fluttering, but she quashed it back down, not wanting to be disappointed. She quickly opened it.

Dear Ginny,

If you get this letter, then it means I have been gone for too long.

Odds are, you are not going to get this letter, but I am writing it just in case. I have it dated for four years after my departure. If I am not back by now, then either I am not as smart as I thought I was, or I am dead. As I am a genius, both of these things are unlikely. Which really just proves my earlier point that you aren't actually going to get this letter. But let's put probability and logic aside. If you get this letter, it means something has gone wrong, and you deserve to know that.

I wish I could tell you why I left. And what will be occupying my time while I am away. I wish that I had said good-bye in person.

We both know that last statement was a lie because you know how rubbish I am at anything emotional. But I do wish I had kissed you.

A few things to say to you now: First, I know I said this in the first letter, but I am waiting for you. Please do not feel obligated to wait for me. You're young, smart, and gorgeous. And if I am not back by now, then there is a good chance I am not coming back at all. Please do not waste your life on me.

Second, I can't give you the manor straight out, because we aren't married, but I am signing over permanent guardianship to you. I gave it to Bill at first because I trust he'll run it well while I am gone these first few years, but if I am dead… well, I think you'd be more pragmatic about what needs to get done. And you won't be afraid to make changes. Also, I want to be able to leave you something good, and the manor is a lovely place. It is your home now, so make yourself comfortable and enjoy it.

Third, I'm sorry. I am sorry I left. I am sorry I am not back. I am sorry that I have failed. Most of all, I am sorry I am not with you now.

Lastly, and most importantly, you are the woman I love. I had never thought I could love someone as I love you. My love has always been a selfish, temperamental emotion. But you I love wholly and purely.

Please forgive me.

Yours,

Draco

Ginny dropped to her knees and sobbed.

oOoOoOo

Present day...

Funny, but to Draco, it looked a lot like he was actually sitting down to dinner, not an emergency meeting. He looked around at those already gathered, wondering if anyone else thought this was strange. No one seemed as confused as he was. Harry, Hermione, and Ron were at the end of the table, helping themselves to fresh bread and butter. Mr. Weasley was reading the paper. Mrs. Weasley was busying setting out platters and dishes while some truly wonderful smells were coming from the kitchen. Bill was helping set the table, and then he slipped into the chair beside him.

"This is the emergency meeting, right?" Draco asked.

Bill nodded. "Emergency meetings involve our strike teams, intelligence teams, Ministry liaisons, and logistics. Harry," he nodded down at the table, "runs one of the strike teams."

"Should I know what that means?" Draco asked, a little testily.

"If you had just waited a moment, I was going to explain it to you," Bill said.

"Oh."

"Strike teams are our rapid response and combat teams. The Ministry has its Civis Arma forces for rapid deployment, but they're primarily concerned with neutralizing the immediate threat, protecting civilian life, and reclaiming lost ground. We're more concerned with cutting Voldemort's power from under him, sabotaging his forces, and waging war."

"Civis Arma is the military waging a politically correct war, and you are the resistance fighters," Draco summed up.

"Exactly."

"How many strike teams are there?"

"Three teams, and they're on call in eight hour shifts. Harry runs one, and Ron and Hermione are on his team, as well as Sirius Black – he's the guy that just came in."

Draco looked at the man. Dark hair and eyes, fair skin, and a sense of laughter about him. The latter was proven when he leaned over Harry, said something to the three gathered, and they all burst into laughter.

"He's actually distantly related to you," said Bill.

Draco jerked a little in surprise, and then looked back at the man. He finally looked up, spotted Draco, and did a bit of a double take.

"Draco?" he asked.

"Wait, Draco?" asked another man, coming into the room. He looked to be about Draco's age. There was a rather sizeable scar on the side of his face. He saw Draco, and actually staggered back a step.

"Draco?" he asked. "Draco, is that-?"

Harry pulled him over to the side and whispered something in his ear.

"That's Blaise Zabini," said Bill. "You went to school together. Dean Thomas is behind him. They're on strike team two. And those two men coming in are Rudy Costace and George Parrish. They're Aurors, which are our police force, and members of the Civis Arma."

The two men wore faded red robes and serious expressions. Their shoulders were tensed, eyes alert. They looked surprised to see Draco, but nothing more. Draco was pretty sure that meant he didn't know them personally. He watched as Mrs. Weasley took in the state of the men, and immediately began fussing. The man called Rudy – the younger man – gave a bit of a roguish grin, clearly pleased with the attention. George looked a little more formal.

"And that's Pansy," said Bill with a bit of a grim note in his voice.

Draco looked over. A gorgeous woman had come in. No, not walked in, flaunted in. She paused for a moment in the doorway, shaking back long dark hair. She wore a business skirt-suit, but the skirt was two inches too short to be professional, and he couldn't tell if she had a shirt underneath her blazer or not. There was an impressive amount of cleavage. She wore an outer-robe that appeared to be silk.

Her eyes lit onto Draco, and something changed in her expression. He didn't know what it was, but she tossed her head back once more and continued her saunter into the room. She ran her fingers over Rudy's neck as she passed, and he turned, an appreciative look on his face. George elbowed him in the side. Blaise pulled out a chair for her and greeted her with a kiss on the cheek. He didn't look down her blazer, even though he had a perfect view. They must be friends.

"Pansy's in intelligence," said Bill. "Well, a bit of a freelancer, but helpful. She's not… she and Charlie… well, they were serious about each other. And then… when he died, she didn't take it too well."

Draco looked at her, wondering if he could tell that she wasn't doing well. She didn't appear to be upset. In fact, she looked fine. She was laughing and flirting with Rudy and George at the same time.

"That's the second third of our intelligence," said Bill as another woman came into the room. She had pale skin, a snub nose, and hair that was currently electric blue. "She's actually your cousin, Tonks."

"Shape shifter," said Draco, remembering the conversation he'd had with Hermione.

"Tonks does infiltration work, whereas Pansy … ,"

"Seduces her way into information?" Draco surmised.

Bill looked a little pained, but nodded.

"Who's the third member of intelligence?"

"Ginny," said Bill.

Draco raised his eyebrows.

"Ginny works in the justice department," Bill explained. "Specifically, trying and convicting Death Eaters. It gives her access to a lot of confidential information – overseas trips, business ventures, money transfers, that sort of thing. We've uncovered quite a few Death Eaters due to monitoring their finances."

"So Ginny will be here," Draco said, feeling something flutter a little nervously in his chest.

Bill shook his head. "She's in a closed meeting with a judge and Advocate Preston. We couldn't get word to her."

The flutter was replaced with a pang of disappointment, and then several more people were coming into the room.

Bill introduced them as Oliver Wood and Hestia Jones, who were on strike team three. Fred and George, more Weasleys and identical twins, were in weapons development, and Draco shouldn't trust anything they give him.

Fleur came in next. She greeted Bill with a kiss, and then Severus arrived, looking a little pinched around the eyes. He strode to the head of the table. There were a few empty chairs. Draco knew that Ginny should have filled one, but didn't know who else was missing. He was going to ask Bill, but then Severus cleared his throat, and the conversation around the table went silent.

"Thank you for your attention," he said in a drolling sort of voice. "By now it's obvious why we've brought you here. We would like to welcome the return of an important member, and also share some vital information with you." He paused. "Or should I say, lack of information.

Draco shot the man a glare, because that just seemed uncalled for. Every face turned to him, and he shifted a little, uncomfortable.

Mrs. Weasley inadvertently saved him by whisking an entire dinner onto the table. And suddenly everyone was more focused on serving themselves heaping plates of food and passing dishes than looking at Draco. And Draco came to the realization that this was not a conference table, rather a dinner table.

He leaned over to Bill and whispered, "Is it normal to have emergency war meetings over dinner?"

"Yes," said Bill. "You get used to it."

Draco shrugged a little, and then helped himself to a plate of roasted chicken, potatoes, and vegetables. The food was good, far better than the food that Draco had been feeding himself for the past three months – and probably the last five years. Mrs. Weasley was showered with compliments, and Severus, at the end of the table, looked a little annoyed at the interruption, but in a resigned sort of way.

The distraction the food provided only lasted about twenty minutes, and then as the diners started getting full, or moving onto second helpings, Draco noticed more and more people were looking his way. Blaise was trying to whisper something at him. Pansy raised her eyebrows at him, and Draco didn't know what it meant. He shifted in his chair a little and drummed his fingers on the table. He jounced his leg up and down. He sighed, slumped back in his chair, and tried taking in a few deep breaths. The two red-heads with identical faces gave him odd looks. Draco started fidgeting again.

Bill pressed on his shoulder to get him to stop. Draco did, rather ill-humoredly, and suffered through the rest of the meal. It wasn't long, thankfully, and then Mrs. Weasley was clearing the table and breaking out coffee and tea – and that seemed to be a cue for everyone else to start talking about work again.

But Draco noticed that the mood was different. Before there was tension and grim faces, now there were relaxed expressions and a few bits of laughter here and there. There was more energy as well. It made sense- from a biological view. Eating was a natural way to decrease stress and anxiety because it was a physical cue that the current environment was safe. Draco wondered if the dinners were deliberately held to distress the attendees, or just a happy accident.

"If we could now return to our previously scheduled conversation," Severus said, not bothering to rise from his chair this time.

The conversation died down again.

"As you can see, Mr. Malfoy has returned to us," Severus said. "So, here to explain where he's been for the past five years, is Mr. Malfoy – or the closest approximation we have to him."

Draco bristled, an angry report on his tongue, but Bill gave him a warning nudge. Draco bit back his response.

"Mr. Malfoy, you have the floor," said Severus.

Draco looked around the table. The faces were expectant, hopeful. He sighed. "So, I have spent the past five years deciphering the Merlin Tomb. I don't know why. I don't have my memories. Bill says that it's most likely that I mind-wiped myself, so until I get my memory back, I'm not entirely sure what the code is for or what it does."

There was a moment of silence. Draco could pick out varying expressions of horror and frustration from the people seated around the table.

"So… how much did you lose?" Blaise asked. His expression was falling more towards concern than frustration, which was nice.

"Well, I don't know who any of you are," said Draco.

"And he doesn't know what magic is," said Bill.

There was a general uproar from the table – at least, from those who didn't know already. Severus was quick to rein them in by tapping his wand on the table. It made a sound like a judge's gavel.

A magic noise spell.

Rather pointless, Draco thought.

"If Mr. Malfoy felt it was important enough to wipe his memory for the sake of this code," Severus said, "then it is safe to assume that it must be crucial to the war."

"Maybe it's a way to defeat Voldemort," said the man called Sirius Black.

"I think the most pressing concern is where are Mr. Malfoy's memories," said Severus. "Draco, do you have any clue where your memories might be?"

Draco frowned a little at his phrasing. "Still in my head, I'd imagine. Maybe there's a memory trigger or something to unlock them."

"People can pull their memories out and store them," said Bill. "It's actually more likely you did that."

"What do you mean, pull them out?" Draco demanded, feeling a little panicked.

"You could have left them here, or somewhere else," said Bill.

"Hope you didn't leave them in Hogwarts," said one of the twins.

"Yeah, that would be a problem," said the other.

They laughed, but Draco wasn't hearing them, not really, because he was still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that his memories were outside of his head.

"Boys, please," Mrs. Weasley scolded.

"Just saying," they moped together.

"Wait," said Draco, because this was really hard information to assimilate. "Memories can take on physical form?"

"It's a little complicated, but quite feasible to take out most of your memories," said Severus. "You would have had the knowledge and the power to do so."

"But if my memories are somehow physical, that means then can be destroyed," said Draco. "Or lost, or broken, or – how was this a good idea?"

"It's alright," said Bill, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. "We'll find them."

"But what if they were at this Hogwarts place? You said it was destroyed."

"You wouldn't have put them in Hogwarts. You didn't trust Dumbledore so far as you could throw him," said Severus.

"What if someone took them?" Draco asked, still panicking. "Or someone moved them, accidentally? Why on earth would I have taken my memories out of my head?"

"You might have feared capture," said Bill.

Draco paused. He didn't remember being captured, but something flickered in the back of his head. His arm went to his shoulder. He remembered pain.

"Draco?" Bill asked.

"Who would want to capture me?" Draco asked.

"Voldemort and his followers," said Bill. "Did you see them? Were they after you?"

The phantom pain slipped away, leaving no memory, just a blank wall. "Not in the past three months. But I can't speak for the other times."

"Wiping your memory might have been the best way to protect yourself," said Bill. "Or protect the code. You can't tell someone something you don't know, not even under Veritaserum."

Draco arched an eyebrow. "You guys have a truth serum? Like sodium pentathol?"

"Far more effective," said Severus with a slight sneer.

"First order of business then," said Bill. "We find Draco's memories."

"Two orders of business," Severus corrected. "Bill, you help Draco find his memories, and meanwhile I want some more information about this code. We'll probably need assistance from the Ministry."

"We'll tell Kingsley and King Arthur," said Rudy, giving a nod.

"King Arthur?" Draco asked.

"Head of the Civis Arma," Bill explained. "King Arthur is a title, not an actual name. It protects the identity of the leader."

"An identity we really should be privy to," said Arthur Weasley, a little sternly. "It would make these meetings more productive, don't you think?"

Rudy smiled and stood up. "That's on a need-to-know basis. When you have something that might stop Voldemort, we'll revisit the subject. But right now, we're concerned with government stability, and protecting our leaders."

"You mean busy negotiating with Death Eaters," Arthur said, derision in his voice, and Draco could tell there were a few other Order members who agreed with him.

"We're keeping the country together as long as possible, while you figure out the Prophecy," said Rudy, with the same good cheer as before. "And if Harry hadn't had already been an Order member, we'd be working with him too. But as he's got you all to help him, we'll focus on making sure there's a country left when this is all over."

He gave a short nod and left, George Parrish following him. Draco watched them go. There was an undercurrent to that discussion that hinted at an ongoing political debate. Part of him knew that he was probably good at politics, and yet it seemed to leave a bad taste in his mouth.

"Who's ready for dessert?" Mrs. Weasley asked, breaking the unsteady quiet that followed the two Aurors' departure.

She brought out a chocolate and raspberry trifle, and while Draco ate, he was bombarded with questions.

"You really don't remember me?" Blaise asked.

"Can you still do magic?" one of the twins asked.

The other twin shoved his brother. "He's lost his memory, not gone Squib."

"Do you remember Hogwarts at all?" Blaise asked.

And then people were trying to fill him in on all the latest happenings. Did he know that Seamus got married? Well, no. And he didn't even know who Seamus was. And Hermione had graduated valedictorian, and Filch had nearly been killed when Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts, but Mrs. Norris had saved him by biting any Death Eater that came close to him.

Why was she biting?

And the Quidditch World cup had been cancelled.

"What's Quidditch?" he asked, and that launched another round of explanation, and seriously? Flying brooms? Were they just trying to be stereotypical now?

Oh, and Dean was now a werewolf?

"What?" Draco demanded, because this was getting really ridiculous now.

"Fenrir bit him," said Harry.

Dean rolled up his sleeve to show him the scar.

"Werewolf?" Draco demanded again. "What, are there vampires now too?"

"Well…," said Harry. He trailed off, and looked a little sympathetic to his plight.

And then the door opened, and a very large man stepped through. A very large man with a very large beard, and someone that large couldn't be possible, could he?

"That's Hagrid," Bill whispered in his ear. "He's half giant."

"But of course," Draco snapped. "Giants and werewolves and vampires – and what else? Unicorns?"

Bill was suspiciously silent.

"Fuck this," Draco spat. He scooted his chair back.

"Oy, you're back, Draco," the large man greeted him. "Glad to see you!"

"Likewise, I'm sure," Draco managed, and then he strode out of the room and kept walking.

That turned out to be a mistake, because he didn't know where he was going. And the manor was big. No, more than big, it was the size of a shopping mall. He walked down far too many halls, and then ran into what must be some sort of refuge wing. Children were running in the halls and shouting and playing. A few parents were watching them, and then they stared at him, like he was a ghost.

Were ghosts real, too?

"Draco!"

Draco stopped and turned. Bill was jogging after him. Draco waited for him to catch up and glared a little.

"I'm sorry," Bill apologized. "I know it's a lot to take in. That was… we'll take it slower next time."

"Next time? Next time I lose my memories, you mean?"

Bill sighed a little. "No, tomorrow. Tomorrow we'll take it slow. I'll explain as we go. And Harry and Hermione can help. They didn't know about magic until they got their acceptance letters."

"Acceptance letters?"

"To Hogwarts," Bill explained. "But, how about for now, we just get you to your room and you can get some sleep?"

"Do I have my own room?" Draco asked.

Bill laughed. "Draco, you have a suite of rooms."

"Oh," said Draco, not quite knowing how he rated that luxury, but pleased none-the-less. "Yes, that sounds good."

"Come on," said Bill. "And I'll give you a bit of a tour on the way there, huh?" And for some reason, Bill found that funny, but Draco didn't know why. Bill pointed out where the family wing ended, which Draco made a mental point not to visit again, and then Bill pointed out which was the dining room used for meetings, and what dining room was used for regular dining. And he pointed out where the rest of the Order was living, and also directions to the dungeons, which was creepy.

And then they reached Draco's room.

"We'll catch up tomorrow," said Bill.

"Yeah, sure," said Draco.

Bill left. Draco turned to the door, reached out to the door handle, and it immediately swung open. Almost as if it was waiting for him.

Draco stepped inside and stared for a moment.

The room was huge. And the bed was… well, it was even larger than a California King. And there was a small sitting area in the room, as well as a very large bathroom and a study, all attached.

There were personal items in the room was well. Draco poured over them like they could return his memory, but he didn't remember winning any of the trophies. There were several for thestral riding (what was a thestral?) and even more for dueling (which sounded dangerous). And there were books – a lot of books. Make that a ton of books. The titles were foreign and just plain odd. Draco wondered if reading them would answer some of his questions, or make him more confused.

At the very least, he needed to sleep. He showered and changed into sleep clothes he found in the wardrobe. He was bigger than the clothes – a little taller and heavier, and wow – he must have been a skinny kid, because he was trim now, and these clothes looked ridiculously small. The seams expanded to fit him, which weirded him out a bit. Magical seams, apparently.

Draco dropped onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling. It was carved and gilded with gold accents. He contemplated the fact that this was his life now.

And then the door was flung open. Draco rolled off the bed, startled, and a young woman rushed inside.

"Wait – Ginny!" Bill called after her.

Draco had just enough time to realize that this was Ginny and to get an impression of her face – pretty, dark eyes, red hair – and then she was in his arms.

He caught her, of course he did, and then her lips were on his, and her hands in his hair – and he was caught off guard for a moment. And then his brain caught up and he returned the kiss because this… this was good. She kissed him like she was drinking him in, and her body was warm against his, and he could feel her trembling a little.

"Ginny," Draco heard Bill say, somewhat urgently in the doorway.

She pulled away just a little and stared up at him. Draco took in her face. Her eyes were a bright brown. She had a dusting of freckles across her nose and cheeks. Her lips were pink with a cupid's bow, and her hair was a gorgeous red-gold. She was altogether captivating.

"Hello," Ginny said, her voice no more than a whisper.

"Hi," Draco whispered back, and he didn't know her yet, but oh, how he wanted to.

"Ginny," Bill said again, this time sounding pained.

"I missed you," Ginny said again, still that same whisper.

And Draco couldn't say it back, not really, because he hadn't missed her. He'd missed the idea of her, sure, but not her in particular. He reached up and touched her face.

She tipped her head to the side, and her eyes searched his, like she was looking for something. Draco knew what she was looking for. Recognition. She pulled back half an inch.

"You don't remember me, do you?"

"No," said Draco.

He watched her fight to keep a neutral expression, but he could read the devastation there.

"Are we," he asked, "by any chance, married?"

She laughed once, the way someone laughs when they first hear bad news because they don't know what else to do. And then she stepped back. Her hands rose to cover her face, but he could see the tears welling up in her eyes.

"I'm sorry," said Draco, lacking anything better to say. It was the wrong thing to say, because that made her sob, and then she was whirling around and running out of the room. Bill chased after her and the door swung shut behind them.

Draco let out a heavy sigh and flopped back onto the bed. He stared back up at the ceiling and fell asleep with the overwhelming sense of wretchedness at having disappointed a whole house full of people. And he didn't even know who those people were.

oOoOoOoOoOo

Ginny listened to Bill's story about finding Draco. She listened to his theories about his memories. She listened to him make wild speculations about the code. She listened to his platitudes and words of reassurance, and then she went to her room, shut herself up in the shower, and cried.

She cried for a full hour, drowning her tears in hot water and lavender-scented bath soap.

And then, after that hour, she felt a little bit better. Once the initial disappointment and grief and hurt had passed, the logical side of her brain kicked in.

Draco was alive. He was alive when Ginny had feared the worst – had, in fact, been told to believe the worse, by none other than Draco himself in the letter he'd sent her a year ago.

But he was alive. And she believed what Bill believed, that Draco had wiped his memories himself. And there was no way that Draco, genius that he was, would have wiped his memories without a way to retrieve them again.

She looked at herself in the mirror. "Be happy," she told herself sternly. "Draco is alive, and everything will work itself out in the end."

She nodded once, and then rummaged around for some clothes to wear. But what did one wear when they were seeing their boyfriend for the first time in five years and said boyfriend had amnesia? And it was late at night. She couldn't exactly dress up for the occasion.

She settled on comfort over fashion, leggings and a soft, over-large sweater. She braided her hair and debated whether or not she should put make-up on. A glance at the clock told her it really was too late, so she left her room and walked next door to Draco's.

She knocked on the door. There wasn't an answer, so she pushed the latch and stepped inside.

She had kept Draco's room the same. No one had changed a thing. Sometimes she came in to sleep on his bed – when she was worried or frustrated or scared. She'd even sprayed his cologne to keep the room smelling like him.

She gently shut the door behind her. The lights were still on and Draco was lying on his bed. Not properly though. He was sideways on the bed, pillows to his left. She could see that his eyes were open, but he didn't move, just stared at the ceiling. He'd been sleeping, that much was apparent by his loose-limbed sprawl.

She crossed over to the bed. "Sorry to wake you."

His eyes finally slid over to her. They were tired and dulled and full of pain, and so much more expressive than she'd ever seen him. It was both foreign and impossibly familiar.

She crawled up onto the bed and sat beside him. He returned his gaze to the ceiling. "I don't remember you."

His voice was flat and instantly recognizable. Ginny felt the urge to grab his hand, but refrained.

"I know," she said instead.

He reached a hand up to scrub at his face. "I don't know anyone."

"Bill told me."

He sighed and then propped himself up on his elbows to look at her. His expression was so frustrated and exhausted and so Draco, that she immediately wanted to make him laugh. It was an urge she often had when Draco was at his most serious, so she leaned in and asked, "Am I hotter than you pictured?"

For just a moment, he stared at her, and then he dropped back onto the bed and laughed. He laughed long and hard, and Ginny's breath caught just watching him. He'd never looked so easy and careless before, so free of expression. She couldn't help but laugh as well.

He pushed himself up and sat in front of her, both of them cross-legged, their knees touching. "I was afraid to picture you," he said. "But yes, much hotter."

"Well, good," said Ginny. "I'd hate to disappoint."

He watched her for a moment and Ginny watched back.

"This is weird," he finally said. "I feel like… I feel like I need to learn you all over again."

"That's fine," Ginny said. "I probably need to learn you too."

"Bill says we can probably find my memories," said Draco, and then his face screwed up, almost boyish in distaste. "But… I don't know. I guess I don't have much faith in something I don't understand."

"That's very like you," Ginny said.

"Are you… or rather, how upset are you that I'm not myself?" Draco asked. And then he glanced away, like he didn't want to know her answer, but she could see himself tensing, preparing for the worst.

Ginny reached out and grabbed his hands. He looked back at her, and didn't shy away from her touch.

"You're still you," Ginny said. "You're still the same, I can see that. You're just… a little more comfortable, is all."

Draco didn't look entirely convinced. She lay down next to him. He had no problem pulling her close so that her head rested on his shoulder.

"I miss you, of course," she said. "And I'm angry that you left. And that I thought you were dead. And obviously this was not the re-union I was hoping for, but you're here now, and we'll get your memories."

"Just like that?" he asked.

"Just like that," she agreed.

OoOoOoOoOoOo

Yay Ginny and Draco, back together... sort of. Please leave a review on your way out!





5. Seductions and Surprises

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I own a couple really cool Christmas gifts though, so that's pretty cool. Like a pineapple vase. Seriously, guys. A vase in the shape of a pineapple. Amazing!

Apologies for the delay. I blame the holidays and also Pansy and Percy - because their story line just got way more complicated than I meant it to get. Hope you enjoy.

oOoOoOoOoOo

Nine Months ago…

Pansy stared at Percy Weasley. It wasn't the first time she'd stared at him. She'd been making a habit of it for the past few weeks. When he was aware of her, or when others were in the office, she just looked. When no one else was around, like right now, she glared. It was the most therapeutic part of her day.

This was the man that had gotten Charlie killed.

The Ministry had fallen just a few months ago. That was how Charlie had died – in the battle – along with hundreds of others. But Pansy didn't care about the others. Just Charlie.

She kicked her legs lightly as she glared and the desk she was sitting on, a cheap metal thing, protested under her weight. And she didn't even weigh that much. The desks at the original Ministry building were built of finely crafted cherry wood. They, and the rest of the building, had all been lost in the battle.

Now, at this new, make-shift Ministry, things weren't so nice. In fact, they were all hand-me-downs. The Ministry had been relocated to the top half of the Auror Academy building, and all of their office furniture was either acquisitioned from the students and faculty, or donated from the public.

Kingsley Shacklebolt had led the move. The other members of the Ministry – the cabinet and the councilors and the Wizengamot – had wanted a replacement building that was equally as grand and opulent as the original Ministry building. There was a big push to take Blenheim Palace from the Muggles.

But Kingsley had simply stated the Auror Academy would do, and moved in. He'd scoped out the small lecture room on the top floor and claimed it as his office. There was nothing special about it. It was modestly furnished with a desk up front, and a set of long tables and chairs for the students. There were windows, sans curtains, and the view was dismal and bleak.

Kingsley had pulled a table over to a window, dragged a chair behind it, and declared himself ready to work. And with that sort of example from the Minister himself, no one else could complain.

Pansy hadn't witnessed that event herself. It had become legend though.

Percy Weasley had worked magic in the room though. Not actual magic. He'd simply found people who wanted to do some good for their Minister after the attack. An antique desk set had been given to Kingsley from the museum – it was Lionel Holstead's desk, a great wizarding general. Several philanthropists had donated art works from their personal collection to the office, and a few furniture suppliers had volunteered their goods as well – curtains, lamps, chairs, area rugs, and more. In short, Percy had turned an old classroom into a real Minister's office, and he'd turned the interior decorating of the Minister's office into a patriotic duty. A few feel-good articles about the nation coming together to create the Minister's office had run throughout the papers over the next weeks, and so he'd also orchestrated a lift in the country's morale as well.

As an Assistant Minister, Percy Weasley was an irreplaceable miracle-worker. But being an excellent Assistant Minister didn't mean he was a good brother, and that was the criteria by which Pansy was judging him.

She watched him work from the open bullpen outside of the office. His own desk was in the front of the room, making him into a receptionist of sorts for the Minister. There was an entire row of filing cabinets behind him, and he was flipping through them now, going more by touch than by sight. He snagged the folder he wanted, flipped through a few pages, and then sighed.

"Ms. Parkinson," he said, voice testy.

He hadn't even looked her way, not really. She was visible to him, directly in his line of sight. The classroom-turned-office had a large doorway, and the doors were usually open. Kingsley wanted to be easily accessible due to the amount of crises that occurred on a daily basis.

Pansy was currently sitting on the desk belonging to the public relations officer. She wasn't in public relations. She was, however, dating said officer. Not that dating was the right word for it. Seducing was a better fit.

Now that her name was called, she hopped off the desk she'd been lounging on and stepped into the Minister's office. She spared a quick glance at Kingsley's desk, but it was empty, as she suspected it would be. Kingsley would have been gone home for the night, whereas her day was just beginning.

Percy Weasley's day might last him another hour or so. His workdays were unparalleled by anyone else in the office. He consistently arrived before Kingsley, who arrived promptly at seven each morning, and stayed an hour or two later than Kingsley as well. And Kingsley usually left at eight pm. When there were emergencies, Percy didn't go home at all.

No, Pansy could not fault him for his work as Assistant Minister.

She stepped up to the desk and flashed a coy smile. "We're making a habit of meeting like this."

Percy scowled at the file in his hands. "You're making the habit, Ms. Parkinson. And as I do not have the time, energy, or interest in ascertaining why you're making it a habit, I ask that you spit it out and stop wasting my time." He sat down at his desk and began paging through the file.

Pansy placed her hands on the desk and leaned down. Her loose blouse gaped, offering an enticing view of her cleavage. "I'd never waste your time, Assistant."

Percy glanced up, no doubt about to say something bland and boring, and was caught off-guard by the display of cleavage. He frowned a little and his lips pursed, like her breasts were a particularly puzzling budgeting problem he needed to solve.

That was not a reaction Pansy was used to getting. Her cleavage once caused a Seeker to fall straight off his broom mid-game. During the qualifying games for the World Cup, no less.

Percy sat back, pulled his glasses off, and pinched the bridge of his nose. "State your piece, and then leave."

"The Order is planning on striking Hogsmeade."

"I'd heard," Percy said shortly. He placed his glasses carefully on the desk and glanced at her, eyes not entirely on her face, but also not on her cleavage. "I do get the updates from the Civis Arma." He made a flicking motion with his fingers, brushing her off.

No, she wasn't going to be able to seduce him. How irritating. That was usually the fastest way to a man's weaknesses. And she would find Percy's weakness. She would find the crack in his armor, slip into his psyche, and find all the faults he kept buried deep within. And then she would reveal them to the world, thereby ensuring his ruin.

Because he had killed Charlie.

"There are several key members opposed to the strike," she revealed. "They think it's too soon after the battle at the Ministry."

Percy paused a moment. He fiddled with a black leather portfolio on his desk, latching and unlatching the silver clasp. It was a tell. He was interested.

"Who's opposed?"

"I gave you that piece for free," said Pansy. "Anything more might cost you. Say a drink? Dinner?"

Percy sat back in his chair. "Why are you asking me to dinner, Ms. Parkinson? What could you possibly gain from speaking with me?"

His voice, for a moment, took Pansy off-guard. It was a weary voice. A strained voice. A voice that said he was not interested in her little games, and Pansy… Pansy felt a flash of anger. She was used to sparking interest. She made it her job to make men interested in her. Even Charlie –

She broke away from that train of thought because it hurt. But she knew that the only way to make it stop hurting was follow the thought to its conclusion. So she finished the thought: Even Charlie had been interested in her.

Charlie had been interested in her for different reasons of course, not just her carefully maintained beauty. But here was this man, this bookish, boring, sniveling coward of a man, who had gotten Charlie killed, and he wasn't paying her any attention.

She bit back her anger, but she must have paused too long, because Percy looked up. He had blue eyes, like half of his family, but his appeared duller, less focused, less sharp. Somewhat vacant even. But he frowned at her, his eyebrows knit, and suddenly his gaze sharpened. For a moment, Pansy wondered if he was looking right through her.

"Ms. Parkinson," he said, and now his voice was taking on a gentler tone, "if there's something wrong…,"

"Forget it," said Pansy with a shrug and a laugh. She felt oddly uncomfortable at that look. She wanted to get away. "Can't blame a girl for trying, can you? Just thought you might fancy a date or a shag. It's the end of the world out there, you know."

She picked up his glasses and slid them back on his face. He blinked at her, first at her cleavage, because once again she was bending over the desk, and then he blinked up at her face. And suddenly his expression cleared, like he had solved that budgeting problem from before.

"You're in trouble," he said. "That's why you're talking to me."

Pansy paused for a moment, taken by surprise. Not because he was right, but because he was so far from the truth. He took her pause as confirmation.

"Who's giving you trouble?" he asked, leaning forward.

Pansy suddenly realized that this was how she got to Percy Weasley. Not through the typical seduction, but by playing the damsel in distress. And she could play that role.

She pulled back quickly, and gave a too-forceful laugh. "Trouble? Why would you say that?" She made a show of glancing at the clock. "Oh, is that the time? I hadn't realized it was so late. I have…," she cast around, pretending that she couldn't think of an excuse, and finished with a hurried, "I have to go."

She left the office, toning down the natural sway in her hips to make it look like she was in a hurry. She ducked her head and hid a little smile. She had him. Now his interest was piqued. She'd take a couple of days off, stay away from the Ministry, and let him obsess over her on his own.

She was always good with foreplay.

oOoOoOoOo

Draco woke up early the next day. Ginny was still lying beside him, and he took a moment to study her face. She had a pretty face. No, a beautiful face. And he was pretty sure she had most of the constellations scattered in the freckles on her nose and cheeks.

If he'd memorized those freckles before, he couldn't recall doing it.

Draco sighed, silently, and then stretched a little. A fancy clock on the bedside table told him it was morning, so he rolled to get off the bed. He actually had to roll several times because it was that large. It was frivolous. No one needed a bed that big. Although… it had been really nice to sleep on. Maybe there was something to be said for having their Headquarters in a veritable mansion.

The shower was similarly large and decadent. Draco washed up under a shower faucet that had twenty different settings, and thought maybe he could get used to all of this luxury. And then he dried himself off on the largest and softest towel he'd ever held, and decided that yes, he liked this Headquarters.

There were even clothes waiting for him on a small bureau in the bathroom, like they had appeared by magic.

Which they had.

Draco picked them up. They were weird clothes. Very formal. The trousers were black and had the faintest of pinstripes. The shirt was pale blue and actually had embroidery around the cuffs and collar. He put them down in distaste. He pulled on the underwear though. At least that was familiar – something similar to boxer-briefs. And perhaps made out of silk?

He stepped out of the bathroom, toweling off his hair as he did, intent on hunting down different clothes. He was greeted by a wolf whistle from the bed. He looked over. Ginny was propped up on her elbows, giving him a decided once over.

He flushed. He knew he did. There was no helping it with skin his pale. She laughed at him. He tossed his towel at her, and then started rummaging through the wardrobe for a pair of jeans.

"Your tattoo isn't moving," Ginny said.

Draco paused in his hunt. His tattoo. The one on his back, the trees and the sword and the snake, the one that was also oddly struck through with old scar tissue in an X formation.

He turned around. "Should it move?"

She nodded. "Very slightly. It's an heirloom mark, a signum. It's magic."

"And the scars?"

"You were disinherited for a while," said Ginny.

"Huh," said Draco, and he started his rummage again.

She came up beside him, and touched his shoulder. He looked down. There was a spider web of scars on his right shoulder. "These are new. Do you remember what happened?"

He shook his head. "What about this one?" He held out his left arm.

She winced a little, and ran her finger lightly over the vaguely snake-shaped scar that was visible on both sides of his arm. "Voldemort ran a knife through your arm. The knife blade was heated, which is why the scarring is so severe."

Draco gaped a little, because that was vicious sounding, and his hand clenched over the scar on reflex.

"You have a habit of making him angry," she said.

"Maybe I should get a different hobby."

She laughed a little and then strolled into the bathroom. "I'll meet you in the dining room for breakfast."

Draco nodded and went back for his search of casual clothing. He found a pair of white trousers made out of stiff cotton that appeared to be the closest to jeans he would find, and pulled them on. A short sleeved gray shirt followed that – far too soft to be anything but some kind of magical cloth. He didn't bother with shoes – not when he remembered the entire walk down was full of plush carpet. He did run a quick hand through his fast drying hair to get it to settle in place, and then walked down to what Bill had pointed out as the informal dining room.

There were people gathered already, and it looked he was one of the last to arrive. Fred and George had pushed their plates away and were sketching out something on a piece of newspaper. Bill was chatting with Fleur, both of them just had coffee cups in front of them. Harry and Hermione were still eating, so Draco snagged the seat next to them.

"Morning," he said to Hermione.

"Good morning," she said back. She handed him a plate from the stack in the center of the table. There were several dishes of breakfast foods. Eggs, sausage, ham, toast and jam, and some type of porridge. Draco stuck with the eggs and toast. There were a few newspapers as well, so Draco snagged one to read as he ate.

He didn't get past the first page.

"Moving pictures," he said in awe. He leaned in close and squinted at it. "Granted, it's not much different than a gif, but it's on paper. How does that work?" He looked over at Hermione and Harry. "Is it the paper that's magic? Or the photo itself?"

Harry looked a little startled. "You know, it never really occurred to me."

"Both," said Hermione. "The paper is charmed to be able to contain the magic, but it's actually a photographic spell that provides the image itself."

"Huh," said Draco. He took a long sip of coffee, and then tried to make sense of the headlines. Someone named Kingsley – who was the Minister, he remembered – was meeting with organizers of neighborhood watches to keep communities safe. Below the front article was a smaller piece about the Minister's Assistant ,Percy Weasley, who was successful in getting more French aid.

"Weasley," said Draco. "How many of them are there?"

"Ah, they don't talk much about that brother," said Hermione.

Draco frowned. He remembered something Bill had said, about Percy no longer being home. "What happened?"

She hesitated, then said in a low voice. "About a year ago, the Ministry fell. During the attack, Charlie Weasley was killed. Instead of attending his funeral, Percy publicly accepted an award for heroism."

Draco frowned a little. "That's it? I mean, it's a dick move, to be sure, but is it worth disowning someone over?"

Hermione glanced around, like she was afraid someone would walk in, and then said in an even lower voice, "Percy was one of the few people who could initiate the self-destruct in the Ministry in case of a Death Eater attack. But he didn't. Not until hundreds of people died in the ensuing battle, including Charlie. He didn't hit the self-destruct until he was safe. And… well, that's what they're mad about. Charlie was at the Ministry, trying to save Percy, and Percy sacrificed hundreds of lives to get himself safe before destroying the Ministry building."

Draco absorbed that information, and then extrapolated from it. "So, the Weasley family is upset because one son didn't kill himself quick enough to save hundreds of lives and save the other son, who was trying to save the first son to begin with." He gave her a look to show he wasn't impressed with that reasoning.

"It's not like that," Hermione said.

"Do they even know what caused him to delay the self-destruct?" Draco asked. "Or why those other people didn't bring down the Ministry when they had the chance?"

"Percy's always been selfish," Hermione said. "And he started the rift between himself and his family. He disowned them first."

"I might too, if they made a habit of assuming the worst about me," said Draco.

Hermione gave a little huff of air. "Well, you're just the same," she pronounced.

Draco had a feeling he shouldn't take it as a compliment. He felt inclined to do so, though.

"You and Percy get along," said Harry, speaking up from the other side of Hermione.

Draco looked over at him. Harry shrugged. "You talked with Percy on occasion. You didn't know each other long, but you probably would have been friends if you did. You think similarly, more practical than emotional, which is good and useful, but you both can… alienate people without really meaning to."

That seemed like a very fair and reasonable explanation. And some very useful insights. Draco gave him a smile and a nod of thanks. Harry seemed a little startled, but he smiled back as well.

Draco turned back to the paper and saw that he'd rated a side column. There was a blurry picture of him from outside the Leaky Cauldron that stated, 'The Return of the Malfoy Heir?'

So he was important enough to rate his own news article? Weird. And what was he heir of?

His musings were interrupted by Ginny. She slid into the seat next to him, kissed him on the cheek, and then stole a piece of his toast.

Draco paused for a moment, because that felt… not familiar. But it felt good. So he kissed her back.

He couldn't help but notice the silence that followed. He looked around the table and figured it was probably a little weird for the Weasley boys, seeing their little sister kissing someone at the breakfast table.

"That's not really Draco, Gin-gin," said one of the twins.

"Call me that again and I will bat-bogey the hell out of you," Ginny said in a faux-pleasant tone of voice. "And it is Draco. Just… lacking certain personality quirks."

"And lacking a great deal of knowledge as well," said Severus, striding into the room. "We really should see about rectifying that situation as soon as possible. Is everyone here?"

Everyone was not here, apparently. Draco didn't know quite who else they were waiting for, but Bill got up to ring a bell on the mantle of the fireplace. Severus glowered while they waited, and Draco finished his breakfast. Everyone else turned out to be Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Blaise, Sirius, Ron, and last to arrive, Pansy, who sauntered in still dressed for the night before in a sparkling black slip of a dress and heavy make-up.

"Don't mind me," she said, waving off everyone's attention with an attractive flutter of her hands. Blaise pushed a cup of tea in her direction. He was rewarded with a bedroom sort of smile that he only rolled his eyes at.

"We should begin with a list of places to look for Draco's memories," Bill said, spearheading the conversation.

Draco tightened his fingers around his cup of coffee, still not liking the fact that his memories were somewhere outside of his head.

"Here is the most likely place to search," said Severus.

"How long is that going to take?" Draco asked, thinking of the size of the Headquarters. And then, "how big are memories? Are we talking an actual physical object, or more of an essence?"

"Essence," Hermione provided. "Usually strand or liquid form. The vessel could be no bigger than a shoe box."

Draco tried to incorporate 'strand' and 'liquid' into his concept of memories.

"His memories could still be in his head as well," Ginny said. "Draco's signum is frozen. He probably did that before leaving – when he signed his estate first to Bill and then to me for temporary custody. If we re-activate his signum, maybe that would unlock something."

Bill nodded. "Okay. We'll contact the law offices about the signum, and we'll start searching here in the meantime. Where else?"

"His place in France," said Harry.

"I have a place in France?" Draco asked.

Bill nodded again. "It'll take us a while to get the visa request through, seeing as the borders have been tightened, but we'll see if Kingsley can expedite it. Anyone else think of a place to check?"

"Gringotts," Ron offered.

"What's that?" Draco asked.

"Wizarding bank," Harry supplied. "It's guarded by goblins and dragons, but it's been attacked a few times. I don't think you'd put anything important there."

"Not unless he wanted to fool anyone else looking for his memories," said Pansy.

Draco looked over at her. As did the rest of the table.

She shrugged a shoulder, and the thin strap of her dress slid down, dangerously low. Blaise pushed it back up for her.

"If Draco wiped his memories, it's because they're important," Pansy said. "Well, what if the people he was hiding his memories from realized he had taken out his memories? They would know that he hid them somewhere, so in hiding them, Draco might have put them someplace he wouldn't expect anyone to look. Like in plain sight. Or at the bank."

It was a twisted sort of a logic that actually made sense.

"Draco does have new scars," Ginny said. "He could have been captured or attacked while he was away, and if he was, it stands to reason that the Death Eaters could know that his memories are gone."

"So then we need to look somewhere obvious, like Gringotts," said Ron.

Bill added it to the list he was writing. "Where else would Draco definitely not hide his memories?"

"Hogwarts," said Harry.

"I thought that taken over," said Draco.

"It's abandoned now," said Severus. "Dumbledore activated most of the wards before it fell, so now it's mostly dead."

"How can a building be dead?" Draco asked, but Severus waved him off. "Put Hogwarts as one of the last options. It will be difficult to get to and search through, and we shouldn't spare the time or energy unless it's absolutely necessary."

"Agreed," said Bill. "Any other suggestions?"

There was silence. A great deal of it. Draco finally asked the question he'd been wondering since he'd arrived. "Do I have any family? Would I have left it with someone I trusted?"

He immediately knew he had said something wrong because the whole table froze. Draco tried to guess what the reason was by the look on their faces, but none of the expressions were easy to read. If they had just looked at him pityingly, he would have known that his family was dead, but these expressions were far more complex. There was hesitation, disgust, pity, frustration, and anger.

Pansy broke the silence. "Draco, darling, we in the Pureblood society don't always have families we trust. More like families that will stab you in the back at the slightest opportunity."

"So I have family," said Draco.

"Sure," said Sirius. "You've got a sister in law and a niece. They're great."

The table laughed. Draco wasn't in on the joke until Ginny leaned in to tell him that Sirius was dating his sister-in-law.

"Long distance," Sirius said. "They're in the States. But before you ask, you wouldn't have left your memories with them. Far too dangerous for them."

"So they're my only family?" Draco asked. "What about my parents?"

"Your mother is…," Bill started, and then trailed off. "Well, that's a complicated situation. Your father is…," and then he stopped, obvious frustration on his face.

"Either they're alive or dead," said Draco. "And either they're good or bad. It's not that complicated."

"Your mom's alive, but she's bad," Ron piped up. He was scolded by half of the table, but he shrugged it off. "It's the truth. And your dad… well, he's sort of inbetween both of those things."

Draco opened his mouth, wanting to ask how someone could be 'inbetween' life and death, but Severus interrupted him.

"That's a story better served for a different day. Suffice it to say, no, you would not have left your memories in the care of anyone not already at this table."

His tone offered a sense of finality that had Draco immediately rebelling against it. How was Severus to know that he hadn't had friends or family members that he trusted? In fact, how were any of these people privy to his relationships with his parents? Draco refused to believe it was as simple as they were making it out to be, but he kept his mouth shut. He had a feeling he'd have to be clever about learning about his parents. And he could be clever.

"So, any last things to add to the list?" Bill asked.

There was silence again. Draco looked around the table. He didn't know if there weren't many places to look for his memories, or if no one knew him well to offer any other suggestions.

"Do I have a house here in England?" he asked.

There was a dumbfounded pause. And then everyone looked his way, mirror expressions of bafflement on their faces.

"I mean, shouldn't that be the first place to look?" Draco asked.

There was one more beat of silence, and then laughter. Peals of laughter.

The Weasley twins fell out of their chairs they were laughing so hard. Sirius threw back his head and guffawed. Ron and Blaise both slapped the table in their mirth. Pansy hurriedly hid her face in her hands, and when Draco looked over, Ginny was wiping tears from her eyes.

Draco thought the laughter would die down, but then the members looked at each other, and laughed even harder, sharing the same joke.

The only one who wasn't laughing was Bill. Draco heaved a sigh, looked his way, and raised his eyebrows, wondering in wordless curiosity what he had just said.

Bill looked thoroughly thunderstruck. "How did you not know?"

"Know what?" Draco challenged.

"I told you when we arrived," Bill said.

"Told me what?"

"I said, 'Welcome home'."

"You said we were at Headquarters," Draco corrected.

Bill shook his head. "I said 'Welcome home'. Draco, this," he gestured out around him, "is your house."

Draco frowned at Bill. And then he looked around the room. The wallpaper was ornate ivory and gold. The dining table and chairs were deep black wood, intricately carved, and obviously antique. Maybe even hand carved. The fireplace was marble. There was a pair of vases on the mantel that appeared to be silver and encrusted with precious stones. There were two very large, very expensive looking oil paintings, both landscapes, hanging on the walls. The frames were gold.

Beyond this room, there were hundreds of rooms, most of them boasting even finer decorations and furnishings.

Draco looked back at Bill. His mind refused to accept what Bill had said as truth. He must have misheard. Or misunderstood. "Sorry. What did you say?"

"He said this is your house, mate," one of the twins said.

"You're a veritable prince, Malfoy," said the other.

They appeared to be telling the truth. At least, Draco could see no obvious signs of falsehood in their faces. He looked to the other members at the table. Most of them had stopped laughing. Several of them were nodding at him.

Draco turned back to Bill. "That's just absurd," he said. "What does one do with a house this big? Are there sightseeing tours that run? Is it a bed and breakfast during the summer?"

There was more laughter. The twins cackled even louder. Draco didn't think it was that funny.

"Merde, the upkeep on this thing must be astronomical," he said. "Not to mention the property taxes. How is this place even sustainable?"

He looked around the table, wanting to demand answers from those gathered. His mind was whirling with the responsibilities that came with owning a home this big. The cleaning. The staff he must employ. The taxes and daily expenses. The grounds. The insurance.

Something like panic seized his lungs and squeezed. He tried to take in a breath, couldn't quite manage it, and thought, for a split second, that he was going to pass out.

And then his body shut down and his mind kicked in. A wash of cold logic swept away the hot fear.

"Right," he said, voice coming out clipped. "I'm going to need to see some expense reports. And the tax logs. Does anyone have a ballpark figure of what my gross annual income is, because I'm calculating the upkeep on this place to be in the millions – and that's in American dollars, and not in whatever strange currency magic works in."

"If we could focus on the matter at hand," Severus said, voice disapproving, but Draco stood up.

"I'd apologize, but I just learned that my overall financial worth has to be bigger than that of a small country, so I'm assuming I can afford any offense I'm about to give. I'm going to call whoever my lawyer is and get a hang of…," he swept out a hand, "all of this. And then we can talk about my memories."

Severus bristled. "I hardly think that's the most productive use of our time."

"His memories could be with his lawyer," said Blaise. "Especially if his first instinct is to figure out his finances."

Draco looked around the table. There were several nods.

"I'll go with him," said Ginny. "We can see about getting his signum re-activated as well, and maybe kill two birds with one stone."

"Very well," said Severus, sounding a little displeased, but that was fine. Draco had bigger things to worry about than upsetting people.

Like, if his house cost millions of dollars in upkeep, then he must have some sort of employment. Or investments. And if they weren't handled correctly, then most likely a lot of people would feel the effects of it.

Ginny took his hand and tugged him out of the room. "Everything's been kept for you," she said. "I should have figured one of the first things you'd want to do is check over your books."

"Does that make me a terrible person?" Draco wondered out loud.

"No, just particular," said Ginny.

Draco looked around at the hall they were walking through. A very expensive hall.

"Does all of this make me a terrible person?" he asked.

"No," said Ginny again. "Still just particular."

"Small mercies then," said Draco. "I could have turned out to be a real bastard, huh?"

Her peals of laughter said that he might still be a bit of a bastard.

oOoOoOoOo

The letter came. It had taken longer than expected, but it was here now.

Pansy had to let a breath out before daring to pick the letter up.

The writing on the front was plain. Percy Weasley wrote practically, without any sense of flair or character.

Charlie's handwriting –

Pansy took a breath and forced herself to continue the thought.

Charlie's handwriting had been slanted and heavy. He didn't like to write. He preferred dictating quills, and so when he did put quill to parchment, his writing was fast and hurried.

This script was basic. Plain. All letters perfectly uniform, like Percy had learned to write by emulating a typewriter.

Pansy opened the letter. It, like the calligraphy, was short and to the point.

Ms. Parkinson –

My Floo address is 'the Eaves'.

I will expect your arrival at 8pm.

Percy

Pansy glanced at the clock. It was only 10am. Plenty of time to prepare.

oOoOoOoOoO

See - I told you Pansy and Percy were getting complicated. Hope you enjoyed the chapter, and please leave a review. Thanks!





6. Surprise Attack

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. But you already knew that...

Author's Note: Well. This is late. I've no one to blame but myself and poor time management. I will really, really try to get the next chapter out in a week. Thanks for being patient!

OoOoOoOo

Three months ago…

Something flickered out of the corner of his eye. Percy glanced over, but saw nothing unusual. Well… that wasn't quite true. Seeing the full Wizengamot Court packed into the Aurors' ramshackle lecture hall was still unusual, despite the fact they'd been having the weekly meetings here for a full four months. Percy just didn't think he'd get used to the juxtaposition of dignified wizards and witches crammed into shabby lecture chairs.

He turned back to the meeting at hand, wondering if he was getting an over-sensitive startle reflex. He wouldn't be the first. The attack on the Ministry, and the loss of life and the destruction of the building, had made everyone slightly paranoid. There were full time counselors at the make-shift Ministry now, and several more who volunteered their time for free sessions on the weekends or after work hours. The counselors were part-healers and part-aura readers. It was their job to seek out anyone who appeared to be overly stressed or frightened and do what they could to ease the emotional trauma.

Of course, the first thing Percy had learned to do, after developing his own ability to read auras, was to learn to mask his own.

He pulled his mind from that direction of thought. No need to travel down that memory path right now. Not when the Minister of Finances was advocating for the selling of war bonds. It was an interesting concept, one that the wizarding world had never implemented before. The Minister of Finances was describing how it had been a rousing success in the Muggle world.

Most of the Wizengamot, and most of the cabinet, looked unconvinced. And that was because the Minister of Finances was using the Muggle world as an example. It was a rookie mistake. And it really was too bad he had made it, because war bonds would actually help off-set a lot of the expenses that were currently racking up.

War was expensive. More and more Aurors were being hired, and more and more Aurors were being killed and injured. The Civis Arma was a volunteer group, but they also had expenses that the Ministry was covering. Combat training, combat healing, combat gear, etc.

And that was to say nothing for the damage that followed an attack. Buildings collapsed. Business went under. Bridges were burnt. Civilians needed rescuing. Homes and possessions were lost, people displaced. Refugee centers needed staffing and funding and resources. People needed food and clothes and shelter. Insurance companies didn't want to pay out claims for fear they'd go bankrupt. Stores weren't producing as much as usual. People weren't buying as much as usual. The economy was circling the drain.

Percy had gotten a sizable pledge from France – thank Merlin for their neighbors next door. He would probably go to America next to see what help he could drum up, but they couldn't keep asking for handouts. They needed a revenue source. War bonds could offer that revenue.

Something flashed in his vision again. He glanced over. Still nothing. He frowned a little, trying to figure out if anyone was wearing anything that was catching the light. Last week one of the staffers had gotten engaged and spent the day trying to get her ring to bounce light into everyone's eyes, just to show off the diamond.

He saw nothing.

The Minister of Finances finished his pitch. There was an uncomfortable silence. Percy turned in his seat, trying to gauge the interest of the court. Blank stares, frowns, and some eyes closed, sleeping. Not good.

The Minister of Finances awkwardly stood in the middle of the floor. This was his first presentation, and he was too green to realize that now he was supposed to ask for someone to second his motion. But that, actually, Percy could work to the country's favor. Percy glanced at Kingsley, who was seated next to Judge Whitcomb in the front of the room, facing the court. Percy raised his eyebrows at the Minister, and Kingsley gave a slight nod.

It was typically Judge Whitcomb's duty to oversee these meetings – to call anyone disruptive into order, and to prompt the presenter to ask for a second. But it was Percy's job to help Kingsley run the Minister, and right now, they were ten minutes past their scheduled break.

So Percy got up and strode to the front of the room. "As it's already past break time, we'll suspend the motion to second until our return. We will reconvene in fifteen minutes."

There were several sighs of relief and an immediate scrape of chairs and rustle of robes as the court members tried to diplomatically outrace one another for the small break room.

And it was a small break room, far too small to comfortably accommodate the large number of court members, and they would all want a cup of tea. The fifteen minute break would last thirty, which would hopefully be enough for the Minister of Finances to save his motion.

Percy snagged the young minister before he could join the throng leaving the lecture hall. "Mr. Gregory, a word."

Everett Gregory obediently followed him towards a quieter corner of the room. Everett was the replacement of the original Minister of Finance who turned out to be a Death Eater sympathizer. As such, he looked a little nervous at Percy's attention.

"Assistant Minister," he said, clutching at the stack of papers he was holding. "Is there something the matter?"

"Something is always the matter," said Percy. "That's the nature of working in politics. The current trouble at hand is the matter of war bonds. We need them."

Gregory looked surprised. "Well, yes."

"And yet, when you ask for a second to your motion, you will not find one. Do you know why?"

Gregory paused, and looked a little uncertain. "Because they don't agree with me?"

"Because you did not present the matter with the appropriate facts. You are speaking to a group of people who are nearly all from wizarding families. Only about five percent are Muggle-born. Yet you used all Muggle examples to defend your idea."

Gregory bristled a little. "Now, wait just a minute-,"

Percy held up a hand, forestalling him. "Listen without arguing, Mr. Gregory. I am not casting aspersions, nor am I insulting anyone. And to be completely honest, if you're getting riled up already, when I have only quoted statistics, then you're not going to last long in this business. And that would be a shame, because I think you are exactly what this country needs right now."

Gregory shut his mouth. He blinked a little, took in a breath, and then released it. "Thank you, Assistant Minister."

Percy nodded in approval. "Were this a peaceful time, Mr. Gregory, the court may have taken a chance on something so far outside their comfort zone. But this is war time, and as such, the court is playing it safe. What you need to do is find some precedent for your war bonds that occurred in wizarding history. Give the court a wizarding example, and then they will listen to you. Understand?"

Gregory nodded. "I understand. But you said we're voting as soon as we reconvene."

"I'll be able to give you a quick ten minutes before the Minister of Safety presents, so make your pitch short and sweet. If you need some help, go down to the legal department, and let them know that I sent you. They've studied finance law, and should be able to help you locate a good example."

Gregory nodded again, eagerly. "I'll get right on it. Thank you, sir!"

He hurried off, cutting through the throng of Wizengamot members still trying to get out of the doors. Percy caught Kingsley's gaze. The Minister was currently in conversation with several foreign ambassadors. Percy gave a nod. Mission accomplished.

Something flashed in his vision again, and Percy turned, irritated, and then realized that there was nothing flashing in his vision. Rather, his vision was flashing.

He was coming down with a migraine.

'Of all the worst possible times,' Percy though with an inward groan, but then had to correct his thinking. Actually, now that the war bond crisis was solved, Percy could miss the rest of the meeting and catch up on the minutes at a later time.

He stopped by Judge Whitcomb, who was still sitting at his desk in the front of the room. He appeared to be napping, feet propped up and eyes closed. Percy knew he was awake.

"Mr. Gregory will get another ten minutes when the Wizengamot returns," he told the Judge.

Whitcomb opened his eyes. "You know the Minister of Safety will protest."

"The Minister of Foreign Affairs went over time. We just want to be fair," said Percy.

Whitcomb smiled. "Ten minutes after you talked to him. No doubt he'll use that ten minutes to make his case for war bonds using a more historically relevant example, and the Wizengamot will actually realize what a grand idea it is, and pass the motion. When will you run this country outright, instead of hiding the shadows?"

"I'm hardly running the country, Your Honor."

Whitcomb snorted. "Just like you didn't get Tierney overthrown?"

The lights flashed in his vision again. Percy frowned. "Really, Your Honor-,"

"You know that the most obvious tell is?" Whitcomb asked.

Percy raised an eyebrow at the judge.

"You're wasting away, that's the tell. No one looks like you unless they're working themselves to death."

"Ten minutes to Mr. Gregory," said Percy. "And to prove it to you that I'm not working myself to death, I am going to take a second lunch break."

He gave the judge a nod and turned on his heel.

"Don't think I didn't see you skip lunch earlier today!" Whitcomb called after him, drawing the attention of several minor officials still in the room.

It was something his mother would say. If his mother was still talking to him.

Percy stopped by Kingsley before leaving. The Minister held up a hand, pausing the ambassadors, and turning to Percy.

"I'm taking lunch," Percy informed him.

"And Gregory?"

"He'll get ten minutes before the war bonds are put to a vote. He's down in legal now, learning how to pander to the traditionalists who get scared of anything Muggle."

"Good work," said Kingsley. "Now go eat something. You look pale."

That was also something his mother would say. Sometimes Percy wondered how very obvious it was that he'd practically been disinherited from his family. And why everyone felt the need to make up for it.

"Natural state for gingers," Percy reminded him. He gave a quick nod to the ambassadors, and then slipped out of the room.

The meeting would take another two hours. Enough time for strong medications and a nap.

He kept the vials of pain reliever in his desk drawer, so he quickly skirted the press of officials and court members, took the stairs up to the top floor, and unlocked the door to the Minister's office. The doors were only ever closed when Kingsley was away.

Percy didn't bother to close them now. He'd be going home in a few minutes to nap more comfortably there. He pulled open the top drawer of his desk, snagged one of the vials of bright yellow liquid, and quickly downed the contents. More lights flashed in his vision, so he gingerly took a seat and waited. He was cautiously optimistic. He'd gotten the potion before the pain had started – it meant he might skip the throbbing headache completely.

"That particular kind of pain reliever is restricted," came a feminine voice.

Percy silently cursed himself for not shutting the door behind him. He looked up at Pansy Parkinson. She smiled at him.

"We're making a habit of meeting this way," she purred, and she did shut the door behind her, and then she slunk forward, hips swaying.

"You are making a habit of it, Ms. Parkinson," Percy corrected. For the past six months she'd been intruding on any moment of privacy he had. She was always impeccably made-up, and scandalously attired, and never said what she wanted from him.

He didn't know why she sought to hound his every step. He didn't know what she was – other than a serial seductress. He was sure there must be something else, something beyond her beauty, because Charlie wouldn't have fallen for her if there was nothing else. Charlie had always been the most emotionally intelligent of the Weasleys.

Percy tucked the empty vial back in the drawer. "Can I help you, Ms. Parkinson?"

She shrugged a shoulder and stepped up to the desk. She trailed a finger along the edge. Her nails were deep red, and slightly pointed. Percy knew it was supposed to be a sexy look, but he always found it rather evil-looking. "Maybe."

Percy couldn't help the exasperated sigh that left his mouth. More lights flickered in his vision, so he dropped his head into his hands and pressed against his temples. "Speak plainly, Ms. Parkinson."

There was silence. He risked a glance up.

"Migraine," she surmised. "And not an illegal pain-potion addiction."

She sounded almost disappointed.

"You sound upset that I'm not an addict," Percy said.

"Just trying to figure you out," said Pansy. "It'd make sense, really, if you did have a potion's addiction. The long hours at work, the stress, it all takes a toll."

"Potions don't help me do my job."

"No, but they'd make you human."

Percy couldn't help but laugh at that. "I get migraines from the stress, Ms. Parkinson. How much more human do you want me to be?"

She paused again. Percy watched something very vulnerable steal across her face. As soon as she saw him looking though, she pushed it away behind her usual flirtations. "Humans need company, too," she said, and leaned a little over the desk.

Percy stood up to get out of the line of sight. She had an annoying habit of letting him see down her shirt. "What do you need from me?"

She glanced his way, the seduction gone. "If I needed to… leave the country suddenly…,"

"There's a wait on traveling papers," Percy said. "To keep Death Eaters from escaping."

"Yes, I know," said Pansy. "But… if it were life and death, would there be a way to get the travel papers pushed through faster?" She perched on the desk and leaned over to place a hand on his. Percy froze for a moment. Her hand was warm. Her skin was soft.

She turned his hand over, palm up on the desk. Percy watched, somewhat curious, as she stroked her fingers down the center of his palm and down his fingers. It was a teasing sensation, both tingling and sensual. He looked up at Pansy. "Tell me why you're targeting me. There are other men to seduce that can get you what you want." He thought for a minute. "Sanderson, down in visas. He could push travel papers through. And he's a big flirt already – and half the secretarial staff swoons over him. Wouldn't that be easier, Ms. Parkinson? And more enjoyable for you?"

She pulled her hand back. Percy closed his hand into a fist, trying to get the sensation of her fingers off his skin, but the tingling sensation remained. He wondered if she'd used some kind of lotion.

"You're definitely a challenge," she said. "You remind me a little bit of Draco, really."

Percy raised an eyebrow. "Wouldn't be the first time someone compared me to a Malfoy. Although last time it was Lucius."

Unbidden, the memory came back. Fire and spells. Pain and fear.

Something throbbed in his head. He sat down and dug his fingers into his scalp, trying to push away the migraine.

"Who said Lucius?" Pansy asked, sounding curious.

Percy flicked his free hand at her, waving her curiosity off. "Doesn't matter. How about you tell me why you need travel papers, and why you're coming here to get it?"

"You're not Lucius," said Pansy. "And you're not Draco either. You're a Weasley with power. That's what I need."

Percy frowned. "But why?"

She only shook her head. "I'm saying too much as it is. Maybe I'll find Sanderson."

She hopped off the desk, having to pull down her skirt as she did to avoid flashing him. He still saw a glimpse of her underwear. Black lace.

It was so expected he couldn't help but laugh a little at the cliché. She turned, startled, and Percy waved her off again. And then he sat down and continued to rub at his temples because the migraine was setting in.

He had a sneaking suspicion that, as he'd taken the pain reliever, this headache was caused by Pansy Parkinson.

OoOoOoOoOo

Present Time…

Draco shifted a little in the chair and rolled his shoulders back.

Ginny glanced at him from behind the stack of papers she was reading. "Does it hurt?"

Draco shook his head immediately. "No."

The signum didn't hurt. He'd been afraid it would. Sitting in the office, shirt off, someone pointing a wand at his back, he was afraid that it would burn or sting. But all he had felt was the sensation of a dried-over scab being pulled from his skin, and then…

Movement. Across his back. A faint flutter.

And then a buzzing in the back of his head.

And then a feeling of connection. Belonging.

It'd been explained to him that the signum connected him to his land, connected him to the spirit of generations of Malfoys before him. And he felt that connection. And it was…

"It feels weird," Draco decided on, going for flippant instead of introspective.

Ginny gave him a side-long look that said she wasn't impressed.

He shifted again. "It's… like I was connected with a part of me I didn't know I was missing. And… I feel like I belong. Like I'm home. Even though I don't remember it, I feel like I'm home."

Ginny put down the magazine she was reading. "I'm glad."

Draco rolled his shoulders again, and then gingerly sat back in the chair. He looked around him at the office lobby.

His lawyer, the one that would explain his wealth and possessions to him, was one of several offices that shared space in the quite-impressive building. It was four stories high, and the lobby was marble and glass and full of small gardens dotted about the area, making it look like a rather expensive green house, expect for the sitting areas and receptionist kiosk.

And the fireplaces along the far wall.

Traveling through fireplaces, of all things.

"Mr. Malfoy?"

Draco turned and looked up. A woman was paused on the open staircase. She was dressed in a severe sort of business robes. She gestured for him to follow.

He and Ginny followed her up the stairs to the second floor. They traversed down the wide hallway, past several other offices, to the end of the hall. She led them into the corner office, a grand collection of rooms decorated in shades of hunter green, deep burgundy, and lots of mahogany.

"Mr. Malfoy," said a middle-aged man, stepping forward, hand outstretched. This was Atticus Fletcher, his lawyer.

Draco shook his hand and gave a cold sort of smile. Ginny had said it'd be best to keep his memory loss a secret, and he'd been practicing cold and distant expressions all morning.

"Did you have a good holiday?" Fletcher asked.

"More of a work holiday," Draco said.

Fletcher nodded and motioned him into the back room. It appeared to be Fletcher's private office. There was a large desk, a collection of bookshelves, and two grand windows, currently covered with heavy tapestries.

Fletcher directed them to sit in the chairs in front of his desk. He then opened up a large ledger book.

"Not many changes have been made to your investments," he said. "Miss Weasley did pull out of some of the more risky investments. I believe she wanted slow, steady gains while you were away."

"I didn't want to blow through your whole fortune," Ginny told him. "I told Mr. Fletcher anything safe and certain, and to keep it that way until you came back."

"Same with the business ventures and land holdings," said Fletcher. "If you like, I'll walk you through stocks and investments first, and then move onto more physical holdings, business, land, and so forth."

Draco nodded. "Proceed."

He glanced over at Ginny, and she nodded once in approval of his acting.

Fletcher took his seat behind the desk, and then gestured to a few lines on the ledger book. "Here are the most recent stock returns in the past quarter. I can walk you through the full five years, if you'd like."

"A simple copy of the reports should suffice," said Draco absently.

There was a beat of silence. Draco looked up.

"All of the reports are duplicated in your own ledger book," said Fletcher. He frowned a little.

Draco inwardly cursed. Another thing he didn't know. But he kept his indifferent mask on. "I'd like a direct copy from your office." And he provided no reason, letting Fletcher make his own assumptions.

Fletcher did. "Our ledger books are resistant to nearly all modification spells."

"Yes," said Draco. "Nearly all."

Fletcher nodded. "As you wish."

There was a knock on the door. It opened and the receptionist stepped through. "Miss Weasley, there's a Floo call for you in the foyer. From Advocate Preston."

Ginny winced. "I did take today off."

"Go ahead," Draco told her.

"I'll be back in a few." Ginny followed the secretary out, and the door shut behind her. Draco turned back to the lawyer, and Fletcher walked him through the past quarter of stocks, investments and then his real estate holdings.

It only took a few minutes because everything was laid out cleanly, and precisely, but also cleverly. Draco was both pleased and relieved at the set up. Fletcher had just turned to the matter of business when the door opened again. The receptionist smiled apologetically.

"Mr. Fletcher. Agnes Jones is in the front room."

Fletcher sighed a little. "My apologies, Mr. Malfoy, but this matter does require immediate attention."

Draco waved him off. "No problem."

And he'd forgotten his acting right there. Fletcher gave him a startled look, but then continued out of the office. He shut the door behind him.

Draco waited for a moment, and then he started flipping through the ledger, not looking at the monetary information, but looking for more personal information. There was a page in the front of the letter that held some personal information. His date of birth. His citizenry. His parents.

Underneath Lucius' name were dates. Birth and death dates, but Draco remembered what Ron had said. That his father wasn't exactly dead. So had he faked his death? Or was he a ghost? Ghosts had to be real, right? Seeing as unicorns and werewolves and vampires were?

There was only a birth date underneath his mother's name. No place of residence or address. He pushed the ledger aside and flipped through the other books. There was more financial information, but nothing further about his mother.

It stood to reason though, that if she was still alive, she must be getting some money from the estate. He'd seen no obvious payments so far, but he'd be able to look more closely when he had his own copies. And he would find her.

He put the books back where he'd found them, and then turned to the door, wondering when his lawyer would return.

A muffled roar sounded, and an explosion rocked the outside of the building. The floor pitched under his feet, and he could hear the sharp crack and shatter of glass exploding.

Draco ran to the windows, and pulled the tapestries back. At first, all he saw was gray. For a split second, he thought that the windows were fake, but then saw that the gray was moving, billowing and rolling. It was smoke so thick that he couldn't see the sky.

A flash of orange crossed the pane, and then in quick succession, a streak of blue and red.

Magic.

A magical battle was taking place outside.

Draco pulled his own wand out. He needed to find Ginny. And then they needed to get out of here.

He turned towards the door just in time to see it burst open. Two dark-robed people ran in – and he immediately knew they weren't there for anything good. He lashed his wand out, the same way he had at the shop. "Ventas!"

The wind spell tossed the two figures backwards, but a third appeared in the doorway. This figure flicked his wand, and a shield of bright gold flashed. The wind spell was deflected, and then the figure yelled out, "Expelliarmus!"

It was a woman's voice, Draco realized, even as he instinctively ducked behind the desk. The spell hit the desk, and then so did a few other spells. The wood creaked and groaned, but held, and when there was a lull in the casting, Draco risked a glance over, and tried the 'Expelliarmus' spell himself.

The magic that left his wand was weak, much weaker than the woman's spell had been. It fizzled out halfway, and Draco had to duck behind the desk again as more curses were cast. His mind whirled. Why hadn't it worked?

The desk gave an alarming lurch against his back.

Wand position, Draco realized. That's what he had done wrong.

He jumped up, tried the spell again, and this time it work. One of the Death Eater's wands was flung out of his grasp. Draco cast it again, in the direction of the others, but then the woman yelled out, "Incarcerous!"

One minute Draco was standing. The next ropes were flying at him. Draco flinched back and threw up his free arm, trying to stop them, but the ropes had a mind of their own. They twined about his arms, jerking them back. They tightened around his hands, and his lost the grip on his wand. They twisted around his chest, and he lost his balance. He fell onto the plush carpet, trying to struggle, but the more he fought, the tighter they became, like a boa constrictor strangling its prey.

Draco forced himself to go limp, and then the ropes stilled. Draco was kicked over onto his back, his arms trapped awkwardly beneath him. He stared up at the Death Eater. The mask was removed, revealing a woman with pale skin, black eyes, and tangled black hair.

"Well, hello again."

Draco stared at the woman. She looked crazed, her lips stretched into a maniacal grin and her eyes sparkling with an unholy sort of glee.

"You don't recognize me," she said, her smile growing. "Just like before."

Draco stared. "Before?"

"You've wiped your memory again," said the woman. She bent down, grasped the neckline of his shirt, and yanked. The shirt tore. She pressed her wand against the scars on his shoulder. "That was me."

Draco immediately started to struggle again, but the bonds only tightened. His chest was constricted. The blood flow cut off from his hands. He forced himself still, even as her mouth smiled cruelly.

"You didn't know anything then either," she said. "And you managed to leave rather quickly. But you don't have an emergency portkey now, I'd expect."

She looked over her shoulder. "Are the anti-apparition wards down yet?"

Draco couldn't quite hear the response, but her face twisted. He assumed it was a no and let out a little breath of relief. He didn't want to go anywhere with her.

"Then make a portkey," she commanded the others. "We need to get him back to the Dark Lord." She turned back to him, reached out a hand, and patted his cheek in a parody of tenderness. "In the meantime, how about you tell your dear old aunt Bellatrix what you've been working on all this time?"

Draco stared in shock. This woman was his aunt?

She laughed, and patted his cheek again. "Come now, I'm family. You can tell me."

Draco shook his head. "I don't have any memories, you know that. I don't know anything."

She pointed her wand at his chest. "Crucio."

Pain.

There was so much pain, Draco was startled by it. He screamed as it rolled over his body and set his nerve endings on fire. His body jerked, as he tried to escape the curse, and the ropes around him tightened again. He could feel his wrist bones grind together, could feel his ribs compress until he couldn't bring any air into his lungs.

His scream died out, because he didn't have the breath to yell. He could only wheeze in gasps, and then the curse ended.

Draco went limp, his mind in shock. The ropes loosened. He heaved in desperate breaths of air.

"Really, Draco," said Bellatrix. "I know you know some things. Tell me what brought you back. What were you working on all those years? What do you have planned?"

Draco didn't have anything planned. And he wasn't entirely sure what the code did, but he knew that telling her about the Merlin code was a bad idea. He shook his head again. "I don't know."

She raised her wand again.

"No – wait!"

Draco's protests were caught off with her cold, "Crucio."

Another wave of fire rolled over him. Fire and lightning this time because his nerves were still raw, and he screamed again. His body jerked uncontrollably. The bonds tightened around him again until he couldn't feel his fingers. His breath was cut off. He couldn't even wheeze in air. His ribs groaned, and then he felt something snap in his chest. It was a stabbing pain on top of the fire-pain of the curse.

And then there was a flash of blue.

Bellatrix was tossed backwards, and the curse ended. The pain stopped, but it seemed to echo in his body. His limbs still twitched. He still couldn't breathe. His vision went spotty.

And then there were hands on him, roughly hauling him up, nails biting into his skin.

Bellatrix.

She screamed something, something at Draco couldn't quite make out. She was shooting evil colors of green at whoever was fighting her. Draco understood then that she was using him like a shield, and if she got the chance, she would take him and run.

He didn't want to go with her, so he snapped his head back. The back of his skull hit her in the face, enough for her grip to loosen. His legs sagged, and then she dropped him. He crumpled fully to the ground. There were more spells. He heard her scream again, and then she shattered the window and leapt out of it.

Ginny was suddenly beside him. She immediately spelled the ropes off of him, and he gasped in air so quickly he choked. She pulled him up to a sitting position while he gulped in air, his chest heaving and eyes stinging. No tears though.

"Are you okay?" Ginny asked.

Draco looked at her. Her eyes were wide, but determined. Her hair had fallen out of the twist she'd been wearing this morning. There was a shallow cut running along one cheek. Her clothes were a little soot-stained. She must have been near the explosion.

And yet her jaw was set. Her expression fearless. Draco fell a little bit more in love with her.

"Ginny, is he okay?"

That was Harry's voice, calling from beyond the remains of the desk. Draco struggled to get up, couldn't quite manage it at first, and then Ginny helped him up.

Draco saw Harry and Ron standing at the ready, wands drawn. They were wearing matching emerald jackets with a symbol on the shoulder, a bird rising from flames. A phoenix.

"You alright, Draco?" Harry asked.

Draco managed a smile. "Sure."

Ginny ducked down and retrieved his wand for him. Draco looked at it. "I really need to learn how to work this thing."

"That's probably a good idea," said Ginny.

"We need to get you to the lobby so you can Floo out," said Harry. "Death Eaters are mostly retreating, but there are a few stragglers."

Draco gripped his wand a little tighter, not quite feeling up to another battle. Harry turned to Ginny. "We'll do a protection detail."

Ginny nodded, and then suddenly they were on the move, and Draco was being guided into place by a firm, but gentle push from Ginny. And Draco realized that he was the one being protected.

Harry took the lead, clearing the way down the hall. Ron took the left side of Draco, and Ginny brought up the rear. The office hall was smoky, thanks to a blown out window that was letting the smoke from outside come in. Debris was scattered along the floor.

Harry made them pause anytime they walked past an office door. Most were empty, only one held a Death Eater still wanting to battle. Draco was pushed back by Ron, and then he and Harry took the Death Eater out while Ginny stood guard beside him.

Draco tried to see the battle himself, wanting to learn what spells were used, wanting to learn more about dueling, but Ginny kept him out of the line of fire, and by default, out of the line of sight.

They made it to the stairs where three wizards in bright red robes were gathered. Draco recognized two from the Order meeting, Rudy Costace and George Parrish. They were with a woman, quite stunning with a blonde bob. She was frowning a little bit.

"Oy, Potter," Rudy called, with a wave. "How's the hunting?"

"Really," said the woman, rolling her eyes.

"We're getting Draco down to the Floo," said Harry. "Looks like he was being targeted, so the sooner we can get him out of here, the sooner the rest will disappear."

Draco started a little. "Wait, what?"

"You're adorable, Malfoy," Rudy said.

"The lobby is cleared," said the woman. "We're heading up to sweep the rest of the building, if you care to join us."

"We'll get Draco situated first," said Harry.

The woman nodded. Despite her assurances, Harry still took the lead down the staircase. Draco stared out over the lobby at the carnage. Smoke was thicker here, as nearly all the glass panes had been shattered. The receptionist's kiosk was in shambles strewn across the floor, and nearly all the small gardens had been completely trampled. There were more red-robed wizards and witches gathered, and some in bright yellow robes that were tending to injured civilians.

Harry took them down to the fireplaces. "We'll help the Civis Arma clean up here," he told Ginny. "Should be back in an hour or two."

She nodded, and then retrieved Floo powder from the mantle over the fireplace, and tossed in a handful. "Malfoy Manor. South Parlor."

She gestured for Draco to step in first, and he did, using the Floo for the second time that day. He stepped out into a room in his house that he hadn't seen yet. Ginny had called it a parlor, but it looked more like an infirmary. There were several beds set up in a row with privacy curtains pushed back. There were two whole shelves of strangely colored liquids. There was a faint astringent scent to the room.

Ginny emerged behind him and then rang the bell on the mantle. Draco turned to her. She let out a heavy breath.

"Well," said Draco. "Not exactly how I pictured the day going."

oOoOoOoOoOo

Bill paged through the journal. He'd been forcing himself to take it page by page, but frustration was setting in now.

And just an hour ago, Strike Team One had been deployed.

Bill was assigned to Strike Team Two. When the alert was sounded during his shift, it was his job to condense all relevant information into a quick sixty second summary while the team was gearing up, and then continue to correspond with them through their deployment, taking in any additional information and sending it their way.

When they'd first developed the strike teams and assignments, it was hard not to jump up at every alert, and assist any team that was deployed, regardless of shift. In fact, Bill had run down for every alert for about the first month.

And then he had burnt himself out.

Now, years into the implementation of the strike teams, it was easier to compartmentalize. It was easier to ignore the alarms when it wasn't his team on shift, easier to ignore the stress and chaos. He didn't know if it was a good or a bad thing that he'd come so accustomed to the state of danger around him.

He pulled his mind from his wandering thoughts, and back onto the work at hand. The Merlin code was brilliant. It was second-to-none he'd ever encountered, and Draco had done a good job with the decryption key. And the grammar rules were well parsed out too. He just had no idea what this code did. Or why Draco had erased his memories.

Bill sighed. And then the medical alert bell sounded. Bill felt his stomach flip, the way it always did when the bell sounded. Someone had been injured. He knew it wasn't a bad sign that the emergency bell had rung here at the Manor though. Had it been a life threatening or severe injury, then the team would have gone to St. Mungo's. Still, he didn't like to think that anyone was injured. Especially as Ron was on Strike Team One. Bill didn't think his parents could handle another loss.

He absently copied down a rather beautiful hieroglyph that was the written word for water. He had no hope of actually pronouncing the language himself, but he could enjoy writing it.

The fireplace in his office flared. His mother's face appeared in the frame. "Bill, come down to the infirmary."

Bill started. "What – why?"

But his mother's face was already gone. Panic clenching at his heart, Bill abandoned the journal and ran for the south parlor.

His mother was tending to someone lying on the bed. Bill expected to see Ron's red-hair. Instead, it was white-blond. Draco.

"What happened?" Bill demanded, hurriedly crossing over to the bedside. Draco's shirt was off. There were lines of bruises cut across his chest and around his wrists.

Draco shot him a comforting smile – and Bill didn't think he'd get used to that. Draco's usual methods of assurance were eye-rolls, a sharp, "I'm fine", or a diatribe on why no one should be worried about him.

"Apparently I have a crazy aunt."

"Bellatrix?" Bill asked, shocked.

"They must have been tracking us," said Ginny. She came over, holding a gauze pad to her face.

"You okay?" Bill asked.

She removed the gauze to show him a shallow cut on her face. "Flying glass," she said. "They separated us at the lawyer's office. They faked a Floo call, so I left, and then they attacked. They were trying to get Draco alone."

"Wanted to take me to the Dark Lord," Draco confirmed, and then he winced as Molly dabbed potion on his ribs.

"How's he doing?" Bill asked her.

"Bruising consistent with an incarcerous spell," his mother said. "One cracked rib because of it. And some minor muscle damage from the Cruciatus."

"Shit," said Bill.

"Is that what it's called?" Draco asked. He dropped his head back onto his pillow and stared up at the ceiling. "I really need to learn more spells."

"Strike Team One arrived along with the Civis Arma," said Ginny. "They're finishing up now. No casualties on our side that I was aware of."

Bill let out a breath. "Okay. Good."

"I'm serious about learning spells," said Draco. "I'm not going out there again without being able to at least attempt to defend myself."

Bill looked at him. This incarnation of Draco wasn't good with hiding his emotions. Bill could read fear in his eyes. He nodded. "You're right. You should be able to protect yourself. We'll add it to the list. Find your memories, figure out this damn code, and help you learn dueling."

Spoken out loud, it sounded a bit overwhelming.

"I bet you pick it up rather fast," said Ginny.

Bill and Draco looked over at her. She shrugged. "A lot of it will be muscle memory, so I have a feeling you'll be a quick study."

She had a point. Bill nodded and then swiped his hands through his hair. "Okay. You recover, then we'll talk."

Another bell sounded. The Strike Team had returned back to the Manor. Bill let out another sigh. No more emergency bells. Everyone was okay for the time being.

His mother patted him on the shoulder. "I'm going to give Draco some sleep aid so his rib will heal up faster. Go get yourself something to eat."

Bill glanced at the clock. It was past lunchtime. He nodded and left, but detoured by his office, planning on taking the journal down to lunch with him. He opened his office door, stepped in, and the carpet squished underneath his feet.

Bill stepped back, startled. The entire carpet was sopping wet. What had happened?

A faint trickling sound came from the desk. In fact, Bill could make out a small stream of water trailing from the surface of the desk, but there was no overturned cup or pitcher, no source of water, especially not to soak the whole floor.

He stepped forward, shoes squishing through the sodden carpet, and then stared at the top of the desk. The water was coping from the notepad he had written on, more specifically, it was coming from the hieroglyphic he had copied down. The one for water.

He picked the notepad up, and the water continued to flow, as if emerging from the glyph itself.

Bill felt his mouth drop open. What sort of new magic was this?

OoOoOoOo

Well, these chapters are getting longer because I keep thinking of things to add, lol. This one is over 7,000 words. Which is crazy... I obviously have a problem. Please leave a review. And next chapter we will get a little bit of what Pansy has planned for Percy...





7. Starting to Unravel the Mysteries

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. Sometimes I wish I did.

Author's Note: I did not proof read this one as much as I usually do. Because I really wanted to get this up ASAP because I've been falling behind on my updating. Feel free to laugh at bad grammar or spelling mistakes, both out-loud and maybe in a review?

OoOoOoOoOo

One year ago…

The battle at the Ministry was not going well.

Charlie ducked down behind a desk, narrowly escaping a barrage of curses. He threw a few shield charms over the desk, and then paused for a moment to catch his breath. Who would have thought that battling Death Eaters would be just as much of a work out as training dragons?

He glanced over to his left. Bill was behind another desk, bleeding a little from the arm, but it appeared to be a shallow wound. He glanced to his right. Harry and Ron were working in tandem, pushing back the Death Eaters in the doorway with well-placed hexes.

Charlie raised his arm to wipe sweat from his forehead. For one brief second, he wondered if he should have argued so passionately about helping the Civis Arma defend the Ministry. If he'd known there was a risk he'd be trapped in the Ministry's bullpen for the accountants, he would have hesitated. Offices, cubicles, and paperwork gave him hives.

Helen Adams peeked her head up from the back of the office, a smear of blood on her cheek. That was Fred's blood. She was patching him up from a rather vicious slashing hex. "I'm getting an emergency beacon!"

An emergency beacon meant an Auror was down and needed assistance. They'd been losing Aurors left and right because the Death Eaters were deliberately targeting the Aurors. It was clear that the Death Eaters intended to win the Ministry building. And if they controlled a building as powerful as the Ministry…

Charlie channeled the anger and frustration he felt into speed. He jumped up from behind the desk and sent out a flurry of nasty hexes that he usually reserved for out-of-control dragons. The Death Eaters fell back screaming.

"Where?" Charlie demanded.

"This floor!" Helen called. "Two rooms left."

Charlie glanced at Bill, and they both nodded.

"Cover us, Harry," Charlie called, and then he and Bill were fighting their way through the hole in the ranks that Charlie had just created.

It was a messy fight, made only messy by the fact that there were still civilians in the Ministry, defenseless civilians now that the Aurors were being taken out. It had been one of the reasons Charlie had advocated for the Order to help. Sending Strike Teams to the Ministry was no different than helping other civilians in office buildings.

Besides, their brother worked here.

Charlie wondered if he was the only one who remembered that Percy was still a Weasley. Percy was cursed with a strong sense of right and wrong, same as the rest of the family, and cursed with the same desire to help. He just had a different way of showing it.

When Percy was twelve, he was convinced he should get a job to help with the finances at home. He'd gone as far as to submit several resumes for accounting work by owl, arguing that as he was better at math than most adults, no one would be any wiser. And he desperately wanted new textbooks, not the hand-me-downs Bill and Charlie had already half-destroyed.

Bill and Charlie – if they had a want for something – had learned to nick it, or save up their paltry allowance, or do odd jobs here and there around the neighborhood. But they'd never really wanted as anything as expensive as new textbooks, and they had definitely never mentioned the lack of finances to their parents' faces. Not the way Percy did.

He'd told their father and mother that with the money he made from the job, he'd get his own textbooks, and there'd still be some leftover for the clothing budget. "We could all get new clothes and no one would think we're poor anymore," Charlie remembered him saying.

Their parents had been mortified. And defensive.

It was, perhaps, a little unfair to Percy that he was the third boy. Bill got all new clothes, and Charlie got his hand-me-downs. As Bill was largely responsible, and the clothes Charlie got were still in decent shape. Charlie was not so kind to the clothes, being a more active, outdoorsy type of boy, and so the clothes Percy did get were quite shabby.

Percy might have got new clothes, if the twins hadn't been born. Having two babies, when one was expected, was a financial drain on the family, especially as the twins seemed to get into a mess or break something every day.

That day, when his attempt at getting an accounting job was discovered, was not the first time he had brought up the lack of money to his parents, nor was it the last. Percy was a quieter type, preferring to read inside, and he was privy to a lot of conversations between the Weasley parents. It made sense that he would overhear the talk about finances and try to help.

Charlie just didn't know why Percy, who was usually so good at being diplomatic, didn't understand why all of his efforts to help with the finances were met with anger from their parents. Percy must know their parents often felt guilty they couldn't provide for their children the way they wanted to. He must understand that the guilt was why his parents were so defensive and angry when he brought it up. He must know that, on some level, he was painting a picture of himself of a son more interested in money than in family values.

Or maybe pushing the point, was Percy's way of being a Weasley. He wouldn't let that bone go until someone validated his point.

Whatever the reason, Percy was here now. Somewhere in the Ministry, and Charlie was going to keep fighting until he was safe, and until all the rest of the civilians were safe. And until the damned building self-destructed. It should have self-destructed half an hour ago. It was obvious that the Death Eaters were winning.

He and Bill fought their way to the office two doors down, and then ducked inside. Bill shut the door and pulled up several powerful wars. Charlie swept the room – it was in shambles – and spotted the Auror tucked behind a filing cabinet. He ran over – recognizing the face. Rudy Costace.

Charlie knew a few basic medical spells. He used them now to stop the bleeding from the Auror's shoulder, reduce some of the swelling on his face, and then finally rouse him into consciousness.

Rudy gasped a little, his eyes flickered, and then he latched onto Charlie's jacket.

"Get out of here, Percy."

Charlie blinked a little in surprise. "It's Charlie."

Rudy stared at him. His eyes seemed to focus a little better. "Where's Percy?"

"I haven't seen him," said Charlie.

"He's here?" Bill asked, coming over to join them.

"Self-destruct," said Rudy. "It's not going off. I was taking him down… the sixth floor. He should have… he should have hit it by now."

Charlie felt something cold clench in his stomach. He turned to Bill.

"Maybe he's laying low somewhere," said Bill.

Charlie couldn't quite tell if it was aiming for optimism, or if he genuinely thought Percy would hide when he had such an important job to do.

"We're going after him," Charlie said. "Get the others. We're going to find Percy."

oOoOoOoOo

Draco leaned in. The entire Order leaned in.

"Is it supposed to do that?" he asked, staring at the hieroglyphic Bill had written on the piece of paper. Water was welling up from the ink. It was pooling on the page and still spreading.

He looked around the table having learned that he needed to gauge his level of incredulity with the reactions of those around him. His shock was mirrored on their faces. Not just shock. Fascination and bafflement.

"So it's not supposed to do that," Draco surmised. "Apparently you don't have a magical written language?"

"No," said Hermione, leaning halfway over the table to look at the parchment. "Not at all."

"Why is it doing that?" Harry asked, looking interested but not quite as captivated as his girlfriend.

Bill shrugged. "As far as I can tell, the words themselves are a form of magic. Watch this." He wrote out another glyph on the page. Fire sparked from the ink and then drowned out in the rapidly spreading pool of water. "That word is fire," Bill explained needlessly.

"That's all well and good," said Sirius. "But how do you turn it off?" He pushed back from the table as the water started flowing in his direction.

Bill reached over with the quill and struck through the glyph.

The water stopped.

Draco looked at the pool of water on the table and considered all the implications of having a magical written language. Would the effect be non-stop? Would water continue to flow from a written word for all eternity?

And for that matter, where did it get its energy from? Surely it had to draw power from somewhere.

His musings were interrupted with a flash of magic. Molly Weasley had the water cleaned up in two expert flicks of her wand.

"And now we know what the Merlin Code is capable of," said Severus, his drawling voice taking on a pensive sort of note. "Now the only question that remains is what are we supposed to do with it?"

Draco could tell the Order members were trying very hard not to look over at him, but most of them still did. Draco shrugged at them, and then winced. Just a few hours ago, his rib had been fractured. The potion had healed it, but it was still uncomfortable.

"We'll find your memories," Bill said. "But at least we know why you had to wipe your memories."

Draco blinked. "We do?"

His confusion was echoed by the rest of the Order, so Bill slid him a piece of notebook paper. "Write the glyph for water."

Oh.

That made sense.

Draco felt a little stupid for not realizing it sooner. He took the quill and wrote out the glyph.

Nothing happened.

Draco tipped his head, studied the glyph, and then the very smallest hint of moisture emerged from the ink.

"You still don't accept magic," Bill said.

"I accept it," Draco said. "I just… struggle with not knowing how it works."

"What did that prove?" Ron asked.

"Draco erased his memories to erase his knowledge of magic," Bill explained. "The glyph's won't work if there's no intent behind them. Without the knowledge of magic, these glyphs are just shapes on a page."

"And Draco couldn't work with the glyphs if he kept drowning himself in water every time he wrote the word water," Hermione said, understanding dawning on her face.

Bill nodded. "No witch or wizard could work with these glyphs without regular magical catastrophes. There's a reason this code is kept in the Department of Mysteries. It's quite dangerous on its own."

"There's a whole journal of that language that Draco brought back," said Harry. "Will that start to magically explode?"

"No," said Draco. "I didn't know what it was when I was writing it, so the glyphs are inert. It's safe."

"And that's also why you had to keep erasing your memory every three months," Bill said. "While you were working with this code, you would have been starting to grasp the concept of magic, and that would have given the glyphs power. You had to keep wiping your mind to get rid of those hints."

"Okay," said Draco, because that made sense. "But why did I keep jumping cities?"

"Power," said Severus. Draco glanced over at the Potion's Master. Severus met his gaze. "That's very powerful magic you were working with. That's traceable."

"Bellatrix said she'd found me before," Draco said.

"If you accidentally learned too much about magic and accidentally imbued one of those glyphs with power, it would have been similar to lighting a beacon. It would have been easy for the Death Eaters to find you."

"So I had to keep myself dumb," Draco concluded.

"I doubt anyone could ever accuse of you that," said Bill.

Draco smirked a little. "And now we just need to know how to use the code."

"We'll start searching the Manor tomorrow," said Severus, getting up from the table. "If your memories are here, we'll find them. But I have potions brewing."

"And it is getting rather late," said Molly. "Does anyone need some tea before bed?"

Draco glanced at the clock. It was not even eight pm. Normally he wouldn't even think about turning in so early, but his body was still tired from the chaos of the day. His mind was sharp though, thanks to the nap he'd taken in the infirmary.

The Order dispersed. Draco began the rather long walk back to his room, and Ginny fell into step beside him. And then she took his hand. Draco smiled at her, swung their hands a little, and then stopped short to avoid Pansy who was hurrying down the hall. She was wearing a black sheath dress that wasn't nearly as indecent as it could have been. Draco was sure that was odd for her.

"Where you going?" Ginny asked.

Pansy shot them a mercenary kind of smile. "I've got a hot date with a red-head."

"What's that supposed to mean?" Draco asked, but she simply flounced down the hall.

"Best not to think about it," Ginny advised him.

She followed him into his room. Draco flopped onto his bed. Ginny sat beside him. "How are you holding up?"

"Oh, you know, discovered a couple of days ago that magic existed, and then I got tortured with magic by a crazy aunt this morning," said Draco.

Ginny winced a little. "I am sorry I left you."

He frowned up at her. "Don't feel guilty. It wasn't your fault."

"I know," said Ginny. "I understand that… I just wish I could protect you more."

Draco pondered that for a moment. "Did you protect other-Draco?"

It was Ginny's turn to frown. She leaned over him, so that her head filled his vision. "There is no other-Draco. You are Draco. Just because you don't have your memories doesn't make you a different person."

Draco sat up, forcing her to sit back. "Doesn't it though? I mean, I don't act like him."

"Like your usual self," Ginny corrected.

Draco waved her off. "No, what makes a person a person is their memories. I have no memories. No prior experiences, no knowledge to draw on. I'm someone different." He paused a moment, but then continued his thought. "I'm someone who might not be good enough right now. There's a war going on, and I can't even protect myself."

Ginny shook her head. "When you were panicking earlier today, about learning that this house is yours, you shut down and went cold instead of getting anxious. That's you."

Draco huffed a little, not convinced.

"The way you want to know things," Ginny continued. "Your curiosity, your desire to learn, your quick-thinking. That's you."

Draco shifted a little, slightly abashed at the praise.

Ginny smiled. "The way you're uncomfortable right now, because you always get uncomfortable when someone says something nice about you, that's you."

Draco met her gaze. She smiled wider and leaned in for a kiss. He obliged, all to happy to press his lips against hers, to drink in her warmth, to have his vision clouded with the red of her hair.

She pulled back. "The annoying habit you have of kissing with your eyes open – that's very much you."

Draco laughed a little, and then pulled her in for another kiss.

A knock on the door separated them. Harry poked his head in. His face looked pinched. "Do you have a minute, Draco?"

"Sure."

Harry came into the room and shut the door behind him. He looked at Ginny, and then at Draco. "What I'm about to tell you is a little sensitive."

Draco glanced at Ginny as well, but then looked back at Harry. "I trusted her with my castle of a house and my finances. I think I'm okay with her knowing what you're about to say."

"You don't have to tell me if you don't want," Ginny told Harry, much more accommodating.

Harry shook his head. "No. It's good you're here too." He paused, a little awkwardly, and then sat on the bed as well. "I think I know the reason you left."

Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry. "And the reason you're just telling me this now is…?"

"Five years ago you told me not to say anything," said Harry. "Well, not in so many words, but it was implied that the reason you were leaving was secret and that I shouldn't tell anyone."

Harry stopped for a minute and rubbed his forehead. Draco found his gaze drawn to the lightning bolt scar that appeared almost carved into his skin.

"What did I tell you five years ago?" Draco asked.

"Five years ago, before you left, you told me that I was the Chosen One," Harry said.

"Was I a fan of stating the obvious?" Draco asked.

Harry laughed a little, but hollowly. "No. You were telling me that because some people thought I might not be the savior."

Draco took in that information, confused. He hadn't thought it was up for debate. Neither did Ginny, apparently.

"Who thought that?" she demanded, something like outrage in her voice.

Harry met her gaze. "Dumbledore."

Ginny stared at him. Her eyes went round.

"Dumbledore told me before he died that I had to be willing to die myself, because I might not be the savior of the wizarding world."

"That's insane," said Ginny firmly. "You've been the one defeating Voldemort this whole time. Of course you're the savior. You're the Boy-Who-Lived."

"That's the problem," said Harry. "I'm not… I'm not just me. When Voldemort killed my parents, he split his soul."

"And made a horcrux," Ginny said, nodding.

"Sorry, what now?" Draco asked.

"It's a piece of Voldemort's soul kept in a vessel," said Ginny. "We tracked them down in your final year of school. It was very impressive. There was a dragon and everything."

Draco wanted to ask about this whole 'soul-splitting' non-sense, but found himself completely sidetracked.

"Dragons," he breathed out. And yes, that was a good thought. Much better than unicorns and werewolves. Dragons were real. "Ginny, is it possible to buy a dragon?"

She flicked him in the ear. Draco glared at her, but she tipped her head meaningfully at Harry. He looked pale, distraught.

Draco reluctantly pulled himself back to the topic at hand. "Right. Sorry. Go on. You were talking about horcruxes."

"The reason I can't kill Voldemort is because I am a horcrux," said Harry. "Dumbledore told me that before he died. A part of Voldemort is in me."

Draco winced, because that sounded gross, but he didn't know how outside the realm of normal this was, so he looked over at Ginny. Her hand was over her mouth. Her face was losing color.

"Oh, Harry," she breathed, and reached out her hand to clasp his knee.

"Sorry to hear that," Draco told Harry, trying for commiserating. "That sounds… very serious."

"It is," said Harry, his face constricting. "Dumbledore said he didn't know how to separate me from the horcrux. Because of that, any magic that I do against Voldemort is… neutralized." Harry took in a breath and steeled himself. "The worst part is – as long as I am alive, Voldemort will be alive. And to kill Voldemort completely, I have to die as well, so every piece of him is gone."

He looked up at Draco and Ginny. "That's why I'm not the savior."

"Then who is?" Draco asked.

Harry gestured at him. "Dumbledore thought it was you."

Draco laughed at the thought. "That's…," he stopped, because Harry wasn't laughing. He looked over at Ginny. Her eyebrows were knitted, expression concerned and confused.

"Dumbledore said I shouldn't hold onto something that isn't mine, that the role of hero isn't mine. And you knew, Draco. You knew about the horcrux five years ago, but you didn't tell me."

There was anger in his voice, and betrayal.

"What did I say?" Draco asked, curious. "What did I say all those years ago?"

Harry sighed. "You said not to believe anyone who said I wasn't the savior. You said… you said you were going to make sure that I was the savior. And that's why you left. I think you were looking for a way to rid me of the horcrux."

Draco nodded. "Okay. I don't suppose I left any hints with you before I left?"

Harry shook his head. "I don't even think you knew then that you'd have to wipe your memories. I think that came later. I don't even know if you knew about the Merlin code then."

"You did," said Ginny. "The last night… the last night you were here, you asked Bill about his journals. And the next you left."

"So I must have realized that the Merlin Code could help Harry."

"You really didn't want to be the savior," Harry confirmed.

"Smart of me," said Draco. "So that gives us something to work with, right? There must be something in the code, or something the code is used for that can separate Harry from the horcrux." He looked at Harry. "We should probably keep this between us for now."

"I thought I should actually tell the Order," said Harry.

"What?" Draco asked. "No – terrible idea."

"I haven't told anyone else what Dumbledore told me because it wouldn't have solved anything," said Harry. "There was no one else to be the savior and… and as long as I'm alive, I'm holding Voldemort to a sort of … stalemate. Neither of us can get the upper-hand, seeing as our magic neutralizes each other. But now you're here."

"What's that supposed to mean?" Draco asked.

Harry shrugged. "What if you didn't find a way to separate me from the horcrux? What if you found a way to defeat Voldemort, and you are the savior?"

"That's ridiculous," said Draco. He turned to Ginny. "Tell Harry that's ridiculous."

"It is ridiculous," Ginny agreed. Harry looked surprised, so Ginny sighed. "Harry, as much as I love Draco, he is not the hero of the wizarding world. That position has always been yours. And if Draco told you five years ago that he was going to make sure you were the hero, then that's what he did."

Draco nodded. "So, no more arguing. You're the savior, and we're going to keep this between us because we're in the middle of a war. I'm not going to tell a bunch of people that their secret weapon is a dud until we know we can fix it." He looked at Harry. "No offense."

"You just wiped all of your memories and spent five years on the run to save my life" said Harry. "You're really not going to be able to offend me."

"Pretty sure it wasn't just altruism on my part," said Draco. "Pretty sure if I save you then the world gets saved, including me. So you could just say I'm very selfish."

"Huh," said Harry, looking at him a little curiously. "You know, you said nearly the same thing five years ago."

"Good to know I was a genius then too," said Draco.

oOoOoOoOo

Pansy stepped out into the living room of Percy Weasley's flat.

It was… unexpected.

She'd been expecting something Spartan and minimalistic. Percy was conservative in his dress and appearance and she had assumed that his home would reflect that. She'd been expecting a sparse and clean environment, maybe done in shades of whites and grays with plenty of glass accents.

Instead, the only word to describe the room was 'comfortable'. It was decorated in shades of blue and brown, with accents of ivory and mint. Bookshelves lined the walls, holding an eclectic collection of books, photos, and knickknacks. The sofa and chairs looked soft and plump, and they were covered with a variety of throw pillows, all charmingly mis-matched. There was a collection of knitted blankets as well that appeared to be handmade. Pansy was pretty sure they were Mrs. Weasley's handiwork, which meant they must be painstakingly cared for, seeing as Percy and the others hadn't been talking for over five years.

"Ms. Parkinson."

Pansy turned. Percy was standing in the doorway to the kitchen. He was still in his business robes, and there was a slight pinch to his features that suggested he had just arrived home himself, and that it had been a hard day at the office.

"I'm impressed," said Pansy with a flirtatious sort of smile. "Most single men live in pigsties."

"Haven't you heard?" Percy asked wryly. "I live at the office."

Pansy laughed a little at the self-deprecation. ""I believe another theory says you're a remarkable life-like golem that sprang up out of the paperwork one night."

Percy laughed as well. It was a startled, unpracticed sort of sound. He cut it off rather quickly. "I apologize, but I haven't had dinner yet. I was planning on eating now. Did you want anything?"

Pansy crossed over to the kitchen, sashaying just a little. She made sure to brush by him so that he'd catch a whiff of her perfume. "What do you have?" She opened the refrigerator uninvited. It was stocked with the basic sort of supplies. Pansy looked it over with a critical eye. "How do you feel about chicken alfredo?"

Percy looked like he wanted to object, so Pansy turned with a fetching smile. "I'll cook. You go change."

Percy's frowned deepened. "Ms. Parkinson, there's no need to cook. I assure you, now that I am aware of your circumstances…,"

He paused. Pansy carefully hid a triumphant smile. She had been leaving a trail of false information for Percy to find. He thought of her as a damsel in distress, so she left clues that would only confirm his suspicious. He would have put all the pieces of the puzzle together and been convinced that Pansy was trying to escape an arranged marriage to a particularly cruel and powerful Death Eater.

It was all false, of course. But Pansy realized that she could find nothing on Percy. Nothing to prove he was the coward that his family painted him to be.

There was nothing but Percy's own memories to prove that fact. And to get his memories, first she needed to get Percy alone. And in relative privacy. So she'd painted herself as the victim to get close to him. And now she was here. In his house.

"You have my assistance," Percy told her, voice serious. "You don't have to put yourself out."

Pansy shook her head. "Let me return the favor."

"I haven't done anything for you yet," said Percy.

"You will," said Pansy. She shooed him out. "Go change. Get comfortable. I'll cook."

Percy acquiesced with a short nod. Pansy watched him walk down the hall and then step into his bedroom. The door closed behind him.

Good.

Pansy had no intention to cook, but she did want it to look like she was about to. She put a pot of water to boil on the stove. She flicked her wand to cut up the chicken and then put it in the oven.

She finally skimmed over the selection of wine in Percy's cabinet, selected a semi-dry white, and opened the bottle. She poured two glasses. In Percy's glass, she added a vial of blue liquid. It disappeared instantly.

She heard Percy's bedroom door open and quickly made herself look busy. She didn't bother turning around until he was in the kitchen, and then she started a little because…

Because Percy was wearing a pair of scuffed trousers and an old Quidditch t-shirt. And he had a tattoo.

Percy saw her gaze and her bafflement, and then he laughed a little. "It was Charlie's fault."

And then he stopped.

Pansy felt the familiar twist of pain in his chest, and if she were to guess, Percy felt it as well because he swallowed hard. "My apologies," he said softly. "I didn't mean to bring up any memories for you."

Pansy was a little unnerved that he knew that much about her, but it made sense. He did get the reports from the Civis Arma. It stood to reason he knew that she and Charlie had been serious.

"Don't apologize," she said, brushing it off so he wouldn't know how deep the pain was felt. She handed him the glass of wine. "Hope you don't mind I opened a bottle." No one ever suspected their own wine was poisoned. If she'd brought her own, he'd be more suspicious. "Tell me about the tattoo and why it was Charlie's fault."

He shook his head and raised the glass to his lips. He paused a moment. "Well, it wasn't all Charlie. It was a stupid attempt to try and be cool." He looked over at her, and there was something a little derisive in his look, like he was mocking himself. "Charlie was always cool."

He put the glass down on the counter without taking a sip of it. Pansy felt frustration well up in her chest, but she forced a smile. "Charlie was very cool," she agreed. It was easy to agree, because Charlie was… Charlie…

"Charlie was so completely comfortable in himself," said Percy.

"Yes," said Pansy, because that described Charlie perfectly.

"Charlie didn't care what anyone else thought of him," said Percy. "I always… well, I always cared too much. But when I was younger and I saw Charlie and his coolness and his tattoos, I mistakenly thought that his tattoos made him cool, and not the other way around. So I got myself a tattoo as well. And of course, I chose the nerdiest tattoo there was, so it did not help my cool factor at all."

Pansy raised her eyebrows, both at Percy's strange openness around her and because she was interested in the tattoo despite herself. Percy pulled up the t-shirt sleeve so she could read the Latin script around his bicep.

"Ipsa scientia potestas est. Knowledge itself is power." Pansy didn't bother to hide her smile. "Yes, a little nerdy."

Percy shrugged and sighed a little. "Well, you're practically family, so I guess you'd learn about it someway or another."

Pansy froze for a moment. Why did he make the comment 'almost family'? She suddenly wondered what else Percy knew. In piquing his interest, had he learned too much about her?

She covered her panic by raising her glass of wine. "To Charlie. And his coolness."

Percy huffed a bit of a laugh, and then picked up his glass as well. "To Charlie and his coolness," he repeated, clinking his glass with hers. They both took a swallow of wine.

Percy lowered his glass and frowned at the oven. "You know, I think you need to turn that on to make it work."

Pansy laughed a little. "So you do. Silly me."

Percy reached for the oven controls. "What temperature-,"

The wine glass slipped out of his hand and hit the floor. It shattered into hundreds of pieces. Wine and glass sprayed out in every direction.

"Whoops," said Pansy.

Percy looked down at his hand, confused. "I'm sorry. I don't…," He swayed a little. And then realization dawned. He looked up at Pansy, his expression shifting from confusion to shock. "What did you do?"

His eyes blinked rapidly behind his glasses, like he was trying to stay awake. His expression shifted to fear and he took a step backwards.

Glass crunched underneath his foot, and Pansy glanced down. He just had socks on his feet. Blood pooled from under his foot.

Percy backpedaled quickly, away from the glass. He stumbled into the china cabinet, lost his balance, and tried to catch himself. The cabinet toppled under his weight and they both went crashing to the floor. Nothing shattered though. The cabinet was charmed.

Percy clamored over it, the drug and desperation warring in his body. He managed to draw his wand, but it fell from numb fingers. Pansy watched him crawl into the living room leaving a trail of blood behind him. He grabbed onto the sofa and tried to pull himself up. He hissed in pain. His legs gave out.

He sank onto the floor.

Pansy stepped over the china cabinet and stood over him, watching him dispassionately. His eyes blinked slowly up at her.

"What did you do?" he asked, voice hardly more than a whisper.

"I drugged you," said Pansy.

She watched his eyes roll back for a moment. She watched him struggle to focus on her. "Why?"

"Because I'm going to end you," said Pansy. "I just need to know how."

She pulled out his wand and leveled it at his head. "Legilimens."

The first few thoughts were weird. In fact, they weren't thoughts at all, but sensations, sounds and smells and touch, but no sight. Everything was black except for a few splashes of color here and there. She pushed past it, and then found was she was looking for. The battle at the Ministry.

She watched Percy fight his way through the Ministry, and then she watched him stop fighting. She watched him walk down the last flight of stairs to the sixth floor, and watched him be surrounded by Death Eaters. And then Voldemort was in front of him. She watched Voldemort's smile stretch into a thin, cruel sort of smile.

"Percy Weasley," Voldemort said.

"Voldemort," Percy responded, quite perfunctory, as if they'd just ran into each other at the park.

The response from Voldemort was a flash of red. Pansy both saw Percy fall back, a spray of blood flying from a cut on his chest, and felt it herself – an echo of the pain Percy had felt in that moment.

She watched Percy get to his feet.

"That's Lord Voldemort," Voldemort corrected.

Percy stared at the Dark Lord. "The English Wizarding Ministry doesn't recognize titles since the Edwin Accords in 1922 when the aristocracy was abolished. And as your attempt at a coup has failed, you are in no position to re-write English law."

Pansy held her breath, wondering what sort of fool Percy Weasley was to quote historical facts at the Dark Lord. But Voldemort didn't respond in violence. Instead he threw back his head and laughed.

"I knew I'd taken the right one," he said.

And Pansy felt the dread Percy had felt pool in her stomach.

OoOoOoOoOoOo

Awful place to stop it, I know. But next chapter will be about the attack on the Ministry and everything that happened. Honestly, getting it up in one week might be beyond me. Two weeks, I'm thinking.





8. The Fall of the Ministry, Part I

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a caffeine headache right about now. Must…have…more…coffee.

Author's note: So – sorry this was late. I got an epic virus that knocked me out for several days. This chapter is a part one, just an FYI…

OoOoOoOoO

One year ago…

"And how are you this morning, Minister?" Violetta Gabny asked. Her silver hair was in its usual perm of tight, silver curls. A blend of blue and purple eye shadows reached up to her eyebrows. Her lips were bright pink, matching the gaudy brooch on her knitted cardigan.

"I can't complain, Vi," said Kingsley, watching as she expertly poured him a cup of coffee from the silver carafe.

She tutted a little at his response. "You're the Minister of Magic, not a saint. You're allowed to complain."

"Yes, ma'am," said Kingsley, smiling at her chiding.

Violetta turned to Percy. "And how are you, dear?"

Kingsley smiled wider at Percy's weary expression. Violetta never called Percy by his title, it was always 'dear' or 'darling' or 'honey'.

"I'm quite well, thank you Ms. Gabny," said Percy, quite perfunctory. Percy never called Violetta anything but 'Ms. Gabny', a passive-aggressive protest at the terms of endearment.

"I can tell you didn't sleep well last night," said Violetta, pouring his coffee. "You have such circles under your eyes. You should drink some lavender and unicorn hair tea before bed. That will set you right to sleep."

She patted his hand with her soft, wrinkled one. Percy's face remained carefully neutral. Kingsley kept on smiling. Violetta was the Minister's personal server during the first shift of the day, which covered breakfast and lunch. She had held the position for fifty years, and didn't seem inclined to retire any time soon.

Now that the coffee was poured, Violetta set out the serving tray holding tiny pitchers of cream and small bowls of sugar. She nestled the tiny stirring spoons in expertly folded serviettes and then turned to pull the drapes open more. Bright sunlight streamed through the windows, lighting the small, decadent room unofficially known as 'The Breakfast Nook'.

It had once been a small receiving room, but had been turned into the Minister's private dining room sometime in the 1800s. Kingsley routinely took his breakfast in the room, and his lunches, when he wasn't dining with the cabinet. Previous Ministers sometimes dined with the wives and children in the room, and others dined with their paramours. But Kingsley had no family. And there was a war going on, so it seemed prudent to work through the meal. That was why he always invited Percy to eat with him.

Well, that and Percy was the son of Arthur and Molly Weasley. Although things were strained between Percy and his family now, Kingsley knew that Molly Weasley would want someone making sure her boy took his meals regularly and wasn't working himself to death.

Percy waited, as usual, for Kingsley to take his cream and sugar first before doctoring his own coffee. Kingsley watched Percy's choices carefully because he could always tell what sort of day it was going to be by the way Percy took his coffee. A splash of cream in his coffee meant it was going to be a relatively easy day – not that governing a country in a civil war was easy, rather that there wasn't anything too daunting on the daily schedule. Black coffee meant Percy was too focused on the schedule or projects at hand to remember to add cream. Those days were busy and chaotic. If Percy took his coffee with both cream and sugar, it meant he was bracing for something truly awful.

Kingsley watched Percy reach for the cream – ruling out the chaotic day. He held his breath for a moment, wondering if Percy was going to reach for the sugar next. Percy didn't. He simply stirred his coffee into a light, almond brown shade, and then set his spoon down on his saucer.

Kingsley let out the breath silently, relieved, and caught the way Violetta ducked her silver head to hide her smile.

"Well, Percy," said Kingsley, taking a sip of his own coffee. "Tell me what we're up against today."

Percy flipped open the weekly calendar that sat next to him on the table. "At nine, you're meeting with the local governors to address the current emergency protocols, particularly the Auror and medi-witch response policies, but I can imagine they're also interested in knowing if they will receive any more funding for the emergency personnel. The answer is no – not until you meet with the Minister of Finances. There will probably be a small photo op when you meet with the governors."

Kingsley frowned a little, because he hated shaking hands and smiling for photos. It seemed disingenuous when there was a war being fought. Violetta caught his frown and slid a plate of egg-whites, turkey bacon, tomatoes and wheat toast in front of him. Kingsley frowned even harder. She slipped him an apple danish. Kingsley grinned at her.

"You're meeting the Minister of Finances at one," said Percy, "so you can ask him about funding for the response teams then. He'll probably say no, not until you can tell him how much foreign aid is coming in. At three, you have a meeting with the Secretary of the Protection of Magical Animals to discuss the illegal use of magical animals for personal protection and defense of private domiciles."

"Really?" Kingsley asked.

Percy looked up from the calendar and Violetta took the opportunity to slip his breakfast plate in front of him. It was brimming with eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast and muffins. Far more food than even Kingsley could eat. Violetta, being the grandmotherly type she was, constantly tried to 'fatten' Percy up.

"You remember the article about a dragon being used as a guard dog?" Percy asked, absent-mindedly reaching for his fork.

"Ah," said Kingsley. He did remember that article. He took a bite of the danish, relishing in the too-sweet, too-sticky pastry. Damn the nutrition Healers and their stupid diets.

"And at six you have a dinner meeting with the German Minister to discuss what financial aid his country is willing to provide."

Kingsley paused, mouth full of danish. He chewed, swallowed, and then asked, "Isn't my day a little backwards?"

"Yes, yes it is," said Percy. "Would you like to know why it's backwards?" He had that particular glint in his eye that came with wrangling uncooperative bureaucrats.

Kingsley knew, right then, that Percy was going to tell him all about that hell that was organizing the Minister's schedule and finagling with other Ministry officials. Kingsley braced himself for the diatribe, but was saved by a loud, ringing alarm that suddenly rang throughout the entire Ministry.

That was the evacuation alarm.

Kingsley didn't bother rushing. He down half of his coffee, popped a piece of turkey bacon in his mouth, and then got up from the table, taking the rest of the danish with him. Percy muttered something under his breath about Death Eaters and inopportune times. He tucked his calendar under his arm and followed Kingsley to the door, coffee in hand. Violetta hurriedly put covers over their breakfast plates and followed them out the door.

Kingsley led the way to his office, the two Aurors who were his bodyguards for the day falling into step beside them. Kingsley didn't bother running. Hardly a week went by without some sort of emergency bell ringing. It was almost routine at this point.

"What is it this time?" Kingsley asked the first Auror, a fresh-faced boy who hardly looked old enough to take his OWLs.

"Skirmish at the checkpoint, sir," said the Auror.

Kingsley nodded, already expecting that answer. Three years ago, a string of assassinations had rocked the minor offices of the Ministry. In response, Kingsley had stepped up security. Anyone who entered the Ministry was checked for weapons, contraband, and polyjuice potion. While the Aurors had gotten very good at keeping the Death Eaters out of the Ministry, it didn't keep the Death Eaters from constantly trying to sneak it.

"We'll have you out of here in no time, sir," the Auror promised, striding over to the fireplace. The second Auror took up a guard position by the door.

Kingsley turned to Percy, who had a pinched look about his face that said he was trying to re-arrange his schedule today. "Maybe it will be a quick trip."

Percy frowned. "We better be back by eight-thirty if you want to be on time for your nine o'clock."

"Oh, dear, I'm afraid breakfast will be cold by then," Violetta fretted.

The guard tossed a handful of Floo powder into the flames. "The Mi-,"

Violetta whipped her wand out, stunningly fast for a woman over seventy. "Incendious!"

The fireplace exploded.

Kingsley was knocked back several feet by a blast of heat, energy, and smoke. He hit the floor and immediately rolled away from the flames. He grabbed his wand and stumbled to his feet. He could see Violetta through the smoke. The second Auror was trying to stun her. She threw a killing curse. The Auror fell.

Kingsley shouted a stunning spell but it was blocked. She responded with a barrage of dark curses. Kingsley stumbled back, his shield charm flickering alarmingly, and then something Quaffle-sized struck her in the head.

She dropped to the ground. Kingsley could see the projectile was a marble bust of the third Minister. He looked over. Percy was on the floor, the pages of his calendar strewn about him. His wand was halfway across the floor – he'd lost it in the blast.

"Nice throw," said Kingsley.

Percy gave him a look that said he didn't appreciate light-hearted banter while the Ministry was under attack. "We need to get you to the secondary egress."

A siren-sort of alarm started wailing then, its tone discordant with the evacuation alarm. That was the fire bell.

Kingsley tightened his grip on his wand.

This was anything but routine.

OoOoOoO

The alarm rang right as Ginny got to the third courtroom of the Ministry.

It was early – just turned eight o'clock – but the courtroom was already near to full capacity. The trial of Brad Turner, wizarding heartthrob/model, was a high profile event. He was accused of aiding and abetting known Death Eaters and participating in assaults against Muggle-born wizards and witches. Due to his popularity and fame, the media was following the proceedings very closely – along with hundreds of school-aged fan girls.

Said fan-girls started screaming when the alarm rang and ran for the doors. The Ministry employees, who were used to the alarms by now, simply rolled their eyes and began packing up their belongings before heading towards the doors. Ginny pushed opposite the crowd to get to the prosecution table where Advocate Preston and his secretary, Hilda Lovely, were packing up their papers.

"Miss Weasley," Preston said, giving her a bland smile. "Right on time to leave again."

"Do you think it's actual Death Eaters, or just Turner-tweens trying to rescue their fantasy boyfriend from trial?" Ginny asked. She took half of the stack of folders from Hilda.

"I wouldn't put it past them," said Preston.

They trailed the rest of the occupants of the courtroom out into the hall. There was a little bit of chaos and a little bit of pushing, as was typical. The stairwell was narrower than the hall, and a little bit of a bottleneck was expected.

"Do you think they lit a garbage can fire?" Preston asked. "Or perhaps used some of your brothers' smoke bombs?"

Ginny shook her head. "The fire alarm isn't ringing. My bet is they stormed the holding cells."

"I think they dosed the guards with love potion and set Turner free," said Hilda.

Ginny laughed a little at the mental image, and that was when the second alarm started. It was a siren-sounding alarm that clashed horribly with the ringing of the evacuation alarm.

"Ha," said Preston. "Fire bell. I win."

The pushing and shoving increased again as the second alarm spurred even the weary Ministry employees to pick up the pace. They reached the stairwell and started climbing. About half of the crowd ahead got off at level nine, wanting to take the lift up to the atrium. It was only one more floor up though. Ginny didn't really see the point.

Preston and Hilda obviously agreed because they followed the half of the crowd taking the stairs. They were only halfway up when the crowd stopped moving.

And then there was screaming from the people above – terrified, high-pitched screams, and then people were shoving. The kind of shoving that came when people were trying to escape something truly horrible.

Ginny was knocked backwards. She dropped the folders in favor of catching herself on the railing. People rushed past her, pushing and screaming and terrified, and she pushed herself into the corner of the ninth floor landing and let the crowd push past her. She couldn't see what was causing the panic, but she could smell smoke, and she could feel a faint tremor in the wall of the stairwell. Something was happening in the atrium.

The last of the crowd pushed passed her, back down to the courtrooms. But there weren't any exits in the courtroom. The people would be trapped there.

Ginny glanced up the stairs. Her hand tightened on her wand.

"Miss Weasley."

Ginny looked over. Advocate Preston was holding onto Hilda. She had a hand over her face. Blood was dripping from her nose. No doubt she'd been struck in the chaos.

"We should move to the lower level until the Aurors come," said Preston.

"And if they don't come?" Ginny asked him. "Or if whoever is causing all that chaos upstairs comes down before the Aurors?"

Preston shook his head. "I'm not a soldier, Miss Weasley. Neither are you."

Ginny transfigured her high heels into flats. "I'm an excellent soldier, Advocate Preston. Try to lock the door behind you."

She started up the stairs, wand in hand. The door to the atrium came into a view, a thick wooden door that proclaimed 'Atrium' in gold lettering. Noise leaked through the door, nearly drowned out by the squealing alarms. It was a rumble of indistinguishable destruction. She placed her hand on the doorknob and carefully eased it open a crack.

The noise of a magical battle hit her – the shouted curses, the crack of spell-fire, the screams that followed a direct hit, the crumble of marble when the spell hit the walls and floors instead.

Ginny could see Death Eaters. Dozens of them. Maybe even a hundred. They were tearing through the atrium, targeting anyone in their sight. Ginny shut the door and cast a quick locking spell. She was an excellent soldier, but she wasn't going to be able to fight that battle alone.

OoOoOoOoO

Bill ran into the conference room and immediately did a quick head count. He had to start over again when Ron and Harry burst into the room, and then Sirius. Dean and Blaise followed a couple of seconds later.

Bill restarted his count and came up with a full Order. He turned to Severus and nodded.

"The Ministry is under attack," said Severus without preamble. "Initial reports put anywhere from fifty to two hundred Death Eaters on site."

There were several dismayed exclamations. Bill felt the tension in the room tighten.

"The strike teams should focus on getting the civilians out of the Ministry," said Arthur, leaning over the conference table. "We'll leave the fighting to the Aurors."

Bill glanced at his father, surprised. The Strike Teams had never shirked from battle before.

"We've never done that before," Charlie said, verbalizing Bill's thoughts.

"We've never been fighting at the Ministry before," Arthur said. "There's no sense risking our lives when there are supposedly trained professionals to handle the combat."

"The Aurors don't have that kind of manpower," Bill pointed out. "Not at the Ministry itself. And it's going to take time to recall re-enforcements from the local offices throughout the country."

"And whose fault is that?" Arthur challenged. "We've been warning them about needing to have more manpower for years now. And what about the Civis Arma? They're stationed at the Ministry, aren't they?"

"The Aurors and the Arma will have home field advantage," Sirius offered. "It may make sense to let them do the majority of the fighting."

"But not all the fighting," said Bill.

"You're just sore that the Ministry isn't handling Voldemort the way you want them to," Charlie said to Arthur.

"How many times did we pay the price for their inaction?" Arthur asked. "Do we risk our small force because of their mistake?"

"Without the Ministry, the general public will have no sort of protection," said Hermione. "We need to do something to help them."

"And how much protection does the Ministry truly offer?" Arthur asked. "Even with Kingsley as Minister, convicted Death Eaters are still running free."

"Let's take a quick minute," Bill said, ready to turn the conversation to something more productive. "Severus, were you aware of any plans Voldemort has for the Ministry?"

"No," said Severus. "The Dark Lord-," he stopped. His face went pale and his hand went to his arm.

"If Voldemort is just calling you now…," said Bill.

Severus nodded, completing the thought. "Then what he has planned is big. Very big. Big enough to keep a secret from anyone he doesn't truly trust. I will let you all argue this out."

He swept from the room. Bill frowned and caught Charlie's gaze.

"Voldemort is making a play for the Ministry," said Charlie.

Bill nodded.

"I say let him have it," said Arthur.

"A war zone is not a time for petty grievances," said Charlie. "People are going to die today, and you're content with only providing half of the support we could offer? All for what? For your injured pride?"

Bill saw his father's face turn red, both anger and embarrassment – when the Weasley temper was at its finest.

"Why not?" asked Pansy, sidling forward with a bit of a wicked grin on her face. "I say, screw the Ministry. Let them burn for not listening to reason, right? All those peons, working in their tiny cubicles, blind to everything that's happening around them… that's what they get for not choosing the right side. Let them be killed. Maybe then the rest of England will listen to us."

"Absolutely not," said Molly, looking rather offended.

"We're not going to leave the civilians in harm's way," said Arthur. He took in a breath, let it out slowly, and then gave a nod. "We coordinate with the Aurors on hand. If the need us to fight, then we'll fight. We'll take the high road on this one."

"How dull," said Pansy.

Bill watched her saunter over to Charlie and lean up to kiss him, a rather self-satisfied smile on her face. She'd just played Arthur Weasley. Bill shook his head a little. He often wondered – now that Charlie and Pansy were getting serious – what it would be like having her as a sister in law.

"The Ministry has safety protocols in place in case of a Death Eater attack," said Hermione. "The focus will be on getting the Minister to safety, and then other key personnel, the cabinet and Wizengamot and so forth. Once the officials have been evacuated, the focus will be on the civilians. And if the Ministry is over run, or if they fear that Voldemort is winning, they'll set the building to self-destruct. So if you hear a banshee scream, you have only three minutes to get out."

"What sort of self-destruct?" Ron asked.

"The building will shut down," said Hermione. "All of the magic will be leached from the building, doors and windows will be sealed shut, the lifts will stop working, no one will be able to get in or out."

"Like Hogwarts," said Harry.

"And then poisonous gas will fill the building," said Hermione.

Harry raised his eyebrows. "Hogwarts didn't do that."

Bill rubbed the back of his neck to ease out some of the tension. "We're going to have to be smart about this. We'll split into our strike teams. Those of you who aren't on a strike team, find your designated captain. We want to make sure that each group contains people familiar with the Ministry layout, just so no one gets lost."

He stopped because Pansy was leaving the room and she was one of the people who knew the Ministry best. She waved as she left. "I'm sitting this one out."

Molly hurried after her, asking if it was still the flu she had from last week.

Bill turned back to the task at hand and suddenly felt very ill-equipped to handle it.

OoOoOoO

Chaos. It was absolute chaos.

Smoke was billowing. Alarms were blaring. Spells were flying.

The Death Eaters had taken out both emergency egress points on the second floor. Percy didn't know how they had known where the emergency exits were – but he also didn't know how Violetta had been impersonated. He was sure she had been impersonated. He didn't want to think that he'd been completely blindsided by a grandmother's face and sweet nicknames. A Death Eater must have used polyjuice to take her form. Or she'd been struck with the Imperious curse.

After the first exit had been lost, a contingent of ten Aurors had arrived, intent on getting the Minister to safety. By the time they had fought their way to the second and third egress points, the entire second floor was in flames or shambles. And the contingent of ten Aurors was down to four.

The fourth emergency exit was on the third floor.

"Stop, stop, stop!" Rudy hissed.

Percy did stop, halfway down the staircase to the third floor. He put out a hand, signaling Kingsley to stop as well.

The Minister let out an irritated breath. Percy knew that Kingsley wanted to fight – and as a former Auror, Kingsley had far more experience in battle scenarios than Percy did. Still, it was Percy's job to get him to safety. And that's what he was going to do.

Rudy glanced out the doorway to the third floor. Percy waited, his fingers cramping around his wand and sweat trickling down his neck. Or it could be blood. They were all a little scraped up – from the explosion at the fireplace and the battles at the second and third egress points.

"Okay, quick," Rudy said, and then they were moving again. Rudy and Auror Constance Eames were in the lead. George Parrish and Peter Holloway brought up the rear.

The fourth egress point was disguised as a maintenance closet deep within the third floor. Percy kept Kingsley back from the lead Aurors by half a hallway, knowing that the Aurors needed space to battle whatever threats they came across.

This time the threat was a basilisk. It struck around a corner, taking Constance and Rudy both by surprise. Kingsley reacted quicker than Percy did. Percy felt a hand snag his collar and yank him back as the basilisk lunged.

George and Peter ran forward, making a second line of defense between the basilisk and the Minister. Percy felt Kingsley step forward, and this time he yanked the Minister back.

"Stay," he told Kingsley.

Kingsley rolled his eyes, obviously telling Percy that he wasn't a child that needed to be protected. Percy rolled his eyes back because he knew Kingsley wasn't a child in need a protection. He was the Minister, for Merlin's sake.

A sharp, pained scream sounded, and they both whipped around. The snake had sunk it fangs into Peter's arm. The Auror was flung to the side. The others closed in, their spells coming out faster and stronger. Desperate. Percy began thinking of the other emergency exits. It appeared the Death Eaters had somehow managed to learn the Ministry's secrets. Would they have all the exits covered?

Another scream. A female's voice. Percy took in a quick breath, steeled his nerves, and then looked over.

Constance was down.

But so was the basilisk.

George was bloodied, bracing himself against the wall with one arm. Rudy was still standing. He looked at George, then at Percy and Kingsley, and then turned and ran further down the hall. Percy knew he was looking for the basilisk's retainers, the Death Eaters responsible for setting the snake loose. There were a few shouts, and few curses, and then Rudy called out.

"Clear!"

Percy moved out first, stepping quickly around the basilisk, not quite running but not walking either. Kingsley followed, matching his pace. Rudy was ahead, two dead Death Eaters at his feet. His face was grim, but once Percy and Kingsley caught up, he started down the hall at a run. They were all more than ready to get out of the Ministry.

Rudy turned left, Percy and Kingsley rounded the corner, and there it was. The maintenance closet.

It was padlocked shut with an old combination lock. The cleaning staff had one code that would open up the maintenance closet. Percy had the other code, the one that activated the closet into a vanishing cabinet. The twin cabinet was in an old stone manor, deep in the country. The Minister's safe house.

Percy entered the combination and then pulled the lock off the door. He pulled the door open and then stepped back. He turned to Kingsley. The Minister balked for a moment.

"I will stun you," Percy told him.

"I will fire you," said Kingsley.

"Let George go first," said Rudy. "Then the Minister."

George stepped through, his wand at the ready – just in case. His steps were only mildly unsteady for the amount of blood he seemed to be losing. Kingsley huffed out a breath, but then followed.

Rudy gestured for Percy to go next, but Percy didn't move forward.

There were alarms blaring throughout the Ministry building. The ringing evacuation alarm, the siren-like fire alarm, the piercing alarm that indicated there were hostile combatants, and the dinging alarm that announced medical emergencies.

There was no screeching, bashee alarm.

Percy knew that the Ministry had been lost. There were too many Death Eaters and too much damage. The building needed to be shut down. In fact, it should have been shut down at least half an hour ago. Something was wrong.

"Technically you should go in there too," said Rudy.

Percy looked over at him. "Technically this building should be dying by now."

They both paused a moment, and then Rudy reached out and shut the door. He re-hung the padlock. Percy felt a small measure of relief. The Minister was safe.

He turned to Rudy. "I need to get to the seventh floor."

Rudy nodded. "I'll take you there."

OoOoOoO

Ginny didn't start fighting until the Aurors arrived on scene. It made no sense to try to fight the battle alone, but once she saw the telltale red robes, she darted out of the stairwell and into the fray.

She'd gotten good at operating in battle scenarios. She knew to move along the perimeter of the room, so that she didn't have to watch her back, and she knew to conserve her energy. No big, sweeping curses or large, violent spells, rather small, directed hexes when she had the clear shot. It meant she'd save her energy while the enemy got tired.

She wasn't the only civilian fighting. This was the Ministry of Magic. Powerful witches and wizards took office here – and once the Aurors showed up and began pushing the Death Eaters back – several others rallied as well.

But the Death Eaters were fighting hard – and it made logical sense. The atrium held the largest entrance and exit points. Any emergency personnel who were trying to get in to help would have to enter through the atrium. And all the civilians, hoping to escape, would try to leave through the atrium. She could see that the Death Eaters were already trying to sabotage the long rows of fireplaces along the atrium walls. The Aurors noticed as well. They split into formations of three and began targeting the Death Eaters.

Ginny stayed back with the other civilians. She focused on the stray Death Eaters – the ones trying to dart through the atrium and delve deeper in the Ministry. She snagged one with a disarming spell followed by incarcerous. The second she stupefied.

The atrium was loud, full of blaring alarms and shouted spells and screams of pain and rage. She didn't hear the roar of flames until she felt a blast of heat from behind her. She stunned a third Death Eater and then whirled around to see a veritable tower of flames in the back of the atrium. That was where the lifts were stationed, leading to the rest of the Ministry.

There were a handful of wizards and witches that were feeding the flames. They weren't dressed like Death Eaters, but Ginny knew that's what they were. Only the Death Eaters would try to trap civilians in the Ministry – cutting them off from their main exit.

"The fire!" Ginny called to the other civilian fighters, grabbing their attention.

She shouted out a water spell, her curse combined with a dozen others. The flames faltered, but didn't die out, not when they were being fed by magic, so Ginny turned to the Death Eaters instead, intent on cutting them down.

The Death Eaters responded by whipping the flames at the rag-tag group of civilians. Ginny threw herself to the side, knowing that a protego charm couldn't shield her from those flames. She grabbed a middle-aged witch on the way down, both of them hitting the floor rather hard – but safe from the flames. She heard anguished screams that said not everyone was so lucky. She turned her head. Two of the civilian fighters were down, their bodies blackened and charred beyond recognition.

The flames grew higher, lapping at the ceiling now. The fire needed to be stopped before it took out the entire floor.

Ginny jumped to her feet and fired out a quick volley of hexes. Only one of the six landed, and then the flames were being whipped towards her again.

She called up a shield charm – a rather dark shield charm – one that Draco would have used. The flames hit and were completely absorbed by her ward. She captured the force of the fire in the shield and then thrust it back out – back towards the Death Eaters.

She caught them off guard. Three of them fell, not expecting her use of dark magic. A fourth whipped a slicing hex at her, and Ginny knew she was going to be too late to call up a shield charm. The dark magic had taken too much of her attention. She couldn't pull back in time, but then a voice rang out.

"Protego!"

A brilliant white shield was flung up around her. The slicing hex rebounded onto the caster. Ginny took the final Death Eater out and then whirled around. Bill was running towards her, an emerald green jacket on. He wasn't alone. It looked as if the entire Order was with him. Ginny could hear the cheers from around the atrium as the Order began helping the Aurors push back the Death Eaters.

"Need some help, sis?" Bill asked.

Ginny grinned.

OoOoOoO

Rudy held up a hand. Percy paused and watched Rudy's count, preparing himself. On three, Rudy stepped into the intersecting hallway, sent out a series of curses, and then safely crossed to the opposite side. On zero, Percy followed his same steps, but ducked in low to catch any remaining Death Eaters off guard.

Rudy had only left him one Death Eater. Percy caught him neatly with a stunning hex, and then joined Rudy on the other side.

The Auror didn't give him any sort of acknowledgement for a job well done, just turned and kept forging his way through the Ministry.

Percy didn't know where he got his energy. Percy felt exhausted. He felt tired and scared and sick to his stomach, and still they kept on, fighting floor after floor, working their way to the fourth, and the fifth, and so close to the sixth. While Percy was ready to drop, Rudy didn't appear to be flagging at all – and he was doing most of the grunt work. He was quick on the draw and powerful on the spells.

He was a little impetuous though. He preferred to throw himself into the thick of things instead of measuring up what was coming next and planning accordingly. That was what made him take the slicing hex to the arm on the next intersection.

Percy immediately covered him, taking out the two Death Eaters and hustling Rudy into a relatively protected doorway.

"Can you still use it?" Percy asked.

Rudy looked at him, expression tight and eyes pained, but his lips quirked up in a smile. "Yeah, not a problem."

Percy didn't call him on the obvious lie because he still needed the Auror.

They kept fighting their way to the back stairwell. Blood loss took Rudy out before they reached the stairs. Percy shoved him into an empty office, activated the beacon on his robe that would send help his way, and continued into the stairwell on his own.

He crept down to the sixth floor. It was conspicuously empty.

By the time Percy realized what that meant, he was already headed down the seventh.

So he continued.

He didn't even bother to stop when the Death Eaters took off their camouflaging robes and fell into step behind him. He made it to the seventh floor, pulled open the door, and then stepped out into the main hall.

Lord Voldemort was waiting for him in the lobby. Two dozen Death Eaters stood in rank behind him. Voldemort's face stretched into a parody of a smile. "Percy Weasley."

Percy didn't like that Voldemort knew his name. He logically understood that being Assistant Minister meant most of the country knew his name, but he felt a thrill of fear at Voldemort's use of his name. How much did Voldemort know about him?

Voldemort said nothing else. Percy glanced behind him, at the door to the stairwell now blocked by another dozen Death Eaters. He stepped further into the lobby, crossing the floor to face Voldemort. His fingers tightened on his wand. "Voldemort," he said, trying to stay calm and keep his voice even.

Voldemort whipped his hand out and a flash of fire seared across Percy's chest. He fell back with a cry, feeling a welt of seared flesh rise on his skin. He gasped, in both shock and pain, and then he was being hauled upright by two Death Eaters.

"That's Lord Voldemort," Voldemort corrected.

Percy took a minute the catch his breath. He tried to think of what to do. Surely others would be coming soon, the others who could initiate the self-destruct. They might even have Aurors with them. He just needed to stall.

Percy looked up at Voldemort. "The English Ministry doesn't recognize titles since the Edwin Accords in 1922 when the aristocracy was abolished. And as your attempt at a coup has failed, you are in no position to re-write English law."

And then Percy tensed, waiting for another flash of fire. Instead, Voldemort threw back his head and laughed. "I knew I saved the right one for last," he told his Death Eaters, and they laughed too, maliciously, like Percy was the butt of a joke he didn't understand yet.

Voldemort swept his robes to the side, and Percy saw four bodies on the ground behind him. Percy recognized those bodies. Those four were the only other ones who could trigger the self-destruct on the Ministry. The only other person with that power, apart from Percy, was Kingsley, and he was safely ensconced away to the secondary site.

Percy looked up at Voldemort in dawning horror. Somehow Voldemort had learned where the self-destruct trigger was hidden, and somehow he had learned who could activate the self-destruct. He had then simply waited for all of them to arrive – to kill them – to ensure that the Ministry would stay standing.

Voldemort was going to seize the building, and all of the power that came with it.

The country would be defenseless.

Percy felt terror wash over him. He lashed out with his wand in a last-ditch effort to stop the Dark Lord, but he was flung back with a simple wave of Voldemort's hand. His wand was torn from his grasp and went clattering along the floor. Percy hit the wall and dropped down. He caught himself on his hands and knees. He sucked in a breath and looked up at the Dark Lord. "What do you want?"

"I want this building," said Voldemort. "And now that I have you, the very last person who could foil my plan, I want information."

Percy pushed himself to his feet. He swayed a little. He didn't know if it was from fear, from hitting his head on the wall, or the spell-fire across his chest. "I'm just the Assistant. I don't know what you expect to gain from holding me hostage."

Voldemort stepped forward. "You are a very good assistant, Percy Weasley. That's what sets you apart from the others here." He gestured to the bodies, and then looked back at Percy, staring him in the eyes. Percy felt a shiver steal over him.

"I know all about you," said Voldemort, in a low, strangely hypnotic sort of voice. "I know that Fudge was a fool, and yet with your help, he became quite the successful Minister. So much so, that I needed to get rid of him. And I know how Oswald Tierney tried to break you, and I know that he couldn't succeed. You managed to overthrow him without ever raising a finger yourself, or revealing your part in his demise. And I know that you are the reason I can't seem to break this Ministry."

Percy laughed a little wildly. He couldn't help it. "That's… that's ridiculous," he managed. "I'm just the Assistant. I'm not the Minister, or anyone important. I help. I assist."

"You got enough foreign aid to replenish the Auror department," said Voldemort.

Percy paused for a moment, a little taken aback that Voldemort knew that fact. The Foreign Affairs Minister had been injured in a Death Eater attack, so Percy had gone in his stead and been able to talk the French Minister into a tidy sum of financial aid. "Well… yes," he allowed.

"You managed to create new policy to allow the Aurors to function as an army," said Voldemort.

Percy shook his head. "That wasn't me. That was -,"

"Don't say Howard Perkins," said Voldemort. "His idea was terrible. You turned it into something different."

"I suggested a few things," said Percy.

"It worked," said Voldemort.

"Well… yes."

"You set a curfew," said Voldemort.

"That was pretty unpopular."

"But effective. You also made supporting Death Eaters to be an act of treason."

"That one still hasn't worked completely," said Percy. "It's been difficult to prove in court."

"You still managed to take out some of my key financial support."

Percy shrugged a little. He didn't want to brag or anything –

Percy stopped that thought. This was Voldemort in front of him, and it was likely that he was going to kill Percy before too long, so what did it matter if he gloated?

So Percy looked Voldemort in the face and gave a little laugh. "I cut your funding in half."

Voldemort's eyes seemed to flash in anger. "Crucio."

Pain.

Pain so severe that Percy dropped to the ground like his strings had been cut. It felt like every nerve ending had just been branded and all he could do was scream.

And he did scream. Violently. His limbs writhed and shook.

Dimly, a part of his brain told him that Voldemort hadn't even used a wand, and that just made him scream harder.

The pain ended so abruptly that it felt like he was plunged into ice-water because the fire in his body was gone so suddenly. It left him shivering on the floor.

"You can see why I'm irritated with you," said Voldemort.

"Seems… understandable," Percy said, his teeth chattering together from the twitching nerves in his jaw.

"You're like… Lucius Malfoy," said Voldemort.

Percy didn't know what he was talking about. He didn't know if he cared what Voldemort was talking about.

"You are so very good getting in my way," said Voldemort. "And yet… you have so much knowledge. So much I need to know."

He knelt down beside Percy. Percy tried to flinch away, but Voldemort grabbed his face. He peered into his eyes, and Percy wondered if Voldemort could see how terrified he was.

"Yes, you're scared," said Voldemort. He placed a hand on Percy's neck and squeezed. Percy choked, tried to fight him away, but his hands were grabbed and pinned down with only one of Voldemort's hands. The Dark Lord was far too strong to be just human. He was something else. Something supernatural.

"I need to know who is in the Civis Arma," said Voldemort. "You have been a thorn in my side with your political machinations, but the Civis Arma is the true threat to me."

Percy wheezed in a breath. "I don't – I don't know that," he said, voice coming out strained from the pressure on his neck.

Voldemort shook his head. "You must know."

"No, no I don't," Percy protested. "The Civis Arma is secret. They don't release names. They're called by the round table – you must know the lore behind it."

Voldemort released the pressure on Percy's neck and stood. Percy gasped in air.

"I do know the lore," Voldemort said. "But I also know that you are an intelligent man. You must know who is in the Civis Arma, even if it is supposed to be secret."

"You want me to guess?" Percy asked.

"Yes," said Voldemort. "I want you to make educated guesses and give me a list of names. Then, I will murder every person you name so that there will be no more Civis Arma."

"Okay," said Percy. "Thompson Kincaid."

"Crucio," said Voldemort.

The fire returned and Percy screamed. His muscles seized and shook and cramped. He kept screaming until he ran out of breath, and then his body reflexively sucked in air, and he was screaming again.

The curse ended.

Percy sobbed in relief.

"Thompson Kincaid is mine," said Voldemort. "Don't try to play games with me."

"You're playing a game with me," Percy managed. He wiped the tears from his eyes. "Pick a name and watch you kill that person?"

"This is war, Percy," said Voldemort. "And I have seized you, a key player in this war. You're mine to use now." He knelt down again and patted Percy's face. "A pity no one quite realized how valuable you are. So, yes, names. I will have them."

Percy sighed and closed his eyes. There was only one thing to say now. He knew as soon as he said it he would die, and it wasn't going to be pretty. It wasn't going to be easy. He was going to be in pain, and he could only hope that he could last long enough not to hate himself when he died.

He opened his eyes. "No," he said, and then he felt tears fall down his face. Hot, miserable tears. Percy didn't want to die. He had never wanted to be a soldier or a spy or a vigilante fighter. And yet here he was – captured by Voldemort, tortured by Voldemort, and going to be killed by Voldemort.

A small childlike voice in the back of his head said that it wasn't fair.

Percy dropped his head against the cold marble floor and wondered for a moment at that voice. He was a middle son in a family nearly full of sons. He had never expected life to be fair.

Voldemort stared down at him, dispassionate and unfeeling. "Crucio."

Pain.

It rolled over him and consumed him.

OoOoOoO

I know, I know. This is a terrible place to stop. But come on, you know that Percy survives, seeing as all this drama took place a year ago. But it is a cliff-hangar. I will try to get the next chapter up by next week – and if I can't, I'll give updates via my profile page if there are any delays. Also - no Draco in this chapter. So weird!





9. The Fall of the Ministry, Part II

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do have a cuddly dog at this moment, so I'm not horribly disappointed.

Author's Note: Character death ahead. You know the one.

OoOoOoOoO

Pain.

Percy screamed from it. He couldn't help but scream from it.

He screamed louder than he thought was possible and longer than he thought was possible. He ran out of air. His lungs sucked in reflexively and the air seemed like sandpaper on his raw throat.

And then he screamed again, long and loud and hard.

How long had he been screaming?

The spell stopped.

The pain stopped, but his body stung in the after-effect. Percy curled in on himself, wishing he could melt through the marble floor. He gasped in a ragged breath.

"Will you answer me, Percy?" Voldemort asked, towering above him.

How many times had he been asked that?

Percy pulled in a couple of quick breaths to brace himself. He shook his head instead of answer because his voice was cracked and hoarse and he was already in so much pain he wanted to spare himself that small piece of discomfort.

"Crucio," said Voldemort.

Percy screamed.

OoOoOoOoOoO

Ginny sent out several hexes, and then dropped back, letting Bill sweep in and take the Death Eaters by surprise. His blasting hex shoved two of the three Death Eaters back, but the third responded with a sudden fire hex. Ginny darted in and called up a shield charm. The fire hit, flared up around the shield, and then dissipated. Ginny dropped the shield.

Bill cast a stunning charm, the Death Eater blocked it, but Ginny was already sending a second. The Death Eater wasn't expecting it. The spell hit and the Death Eater dropped.

Ginny ran forward, Bill outpacing her and reaching the Death Eater first because he wasn't wearing a pencil skirt. Ginny felt the slit in the back of her skirt tear even further as she reached the downed Death Eaters. She stunned the two that had been toppled by Bill's blasting hex and then quickly bound them with an incarcerous spell.

She immediately looked up once she had finished, wand at the ready, but for the first time since the Aurors and Order had arrived, the fight in the atrium had stopped. Instead of finding the next skirmish, Ginny instead found herself staring at the aftermath of the battle.

Bodies littered the marble floor, and Ginny was briefly reminded of her fourth year – when the DA had gone to the Department of Mysteries – but this was bigger. Much bigger. At least half of the Floos were out, the fireplaces destroyed by the Death Eaters. Smoke was rising from several locations, staining the air gray and stinging her eyes. The marble floor was cracked in places and smeared with blood in others. Nearly all of the lifts had been destroyed, and the elevator wells were nothing more than charred tunnels. The fountain in the center of the atrium was broken and spraying a constant hiss of water onto the floor.

The bodies were the worst though. Some were in the black robes of the Death Eaters, some in the red-robes of the Aurors, but most were in neutral-toned business robes. Just regular people who had come in for a regular day of work.

Ginny paused for a moment, because now that the adrenaline was fading, the horror of war was sinking in.

"Get me a standing Floo to St. Mungo's," a voice rang out.

Ginny turned. Hermione was standing beside one of the fireplace. Her face was smudged with dirt. Her emerald green jacket was torn on one sleeve. For a moment, no one moved. And then an Auror strode over – Ginny recognized her. Helen Adams, one of the Civis Arma.

"Yates, Carson," she said, voice commanding, "I want all the injured triaged for a Floo trip to St. Mungos." She reached over to the fireplace and pulled out Floo powder. "Pulaski and Rivera, I want every live Death Eater in shackles and put somewhere out of the way."

And then there was purpose again. The Aurors began moving, began tending to those on the floor. The civilians, those that were mobile, began helping, still looking a little stunned. The Order members wandered closer to Bill, waiting for their next task. Ginny followed them, taking stock of who was present – Dean and Blaise and Oliver and Tonks. The other Order members must be elsewhere in the Ministry.

"Weasley."

Ginny and Bill both turned. Helen crossed over to them, two Aurors trailing behind her.

"What's the situation?" Bill asked.

"This was just one group of Death Eaters," said Helen. "We're getting reports that Death Eaters are on every floor."

"Kingsley?" Bill asked.

"The Minister has been evacuated, as well as most of his cabinet and most of the Wizengamot. But we have hundreds of civilians still trapped in the building and at least a hundred Death Eaters on site. They're trying to take the Ministry – and in doing so, they're trying to take as many civilians hostage as they can."

"What can we help you with?"

Helen brushed her hair out of her face. "We need to get as many civilians evacuated as possible. And we need to set the self-destruct on the Ministry."

Ginny felt something break in her heart. First Hogwarts. Now the Ministry. Would the losses ever stop?

"How do we set the self-destruct?" Bill asked.

"There are six Ministry officials who know where the destruct is located and can initiate the countdown. We're trying to locate them now, but we're probably going to have to go floor-to-floor."

Bill nodded. "We'll help you find them. Who are we looking for?"

Helen hesitated. It was clear she was warring with herself because revealing that kind of Ministry secret was treasonous, but then desperation won out. "The Minister himself."

"Who's already safe," Bill said.

"The Minister's Assistant."

"Percy?" Ginny asked in surprise.

Helen nodded. "Then John Kelley, Head of the Cabinet. Flora Chaucer, Secretary of the Cabinet, Gregor Lee, Head Councilor of the Wizengamot, and Licester Jones, Vice Councilor."

"And if we can't locate them?"

Helen looked grim. "Then we'll have to take back every inch of this Ministry."

Ginny looked around her. Already the battle for the atrium had claimed too many lives, and had taken too long. How long would it take to reclaim the full Ministry? Days? Weeks? Was it even possible?

"We'll go with you," Bill said. "We rescue civilians as we go, we find those officials, and then we help set the self-destruct."

Helen nodded.

"There are at least a hundred civilians in the courtrooms," Ginny said, thinking of Advocate Preston and Hilda.

"You focus on getting the civilians out," Bill told her. "And hold the atrium. We'll be sending more down to you as we clear out floors. But be careful. I have a feeling the Death Eaters will be back. They've already proven they want to take out as many egress points as possible."

Ginny nodded. She recognized that as well.

"Finn and Petrov will help," said Helen, gesturing to the two Aurors behind her. "The rest of us… the Ministry is lost. Let's go take it out, huh?"

oOoOoOo

Pain.

Percy screamed.

He wondered if it was possible to die from screaming.

He wondered if he would die screaming, or if his voice would give out first.

It was hard to breathe. His vision was graying out.

He kept screaming – and then the curse lifted.

He screamed a few seconds longer, because the pain took too long to stop, because the nerves in his body were fried. And then the pain finally began to recede and he could stop screaming.

"See?" he heard Voldemort say. "I knew he was the right choice. He fights so hard because he has so much to protect."

Voldemort stepped back, and then suddenly there were hands on him. Percy tried to jerk away, but couldn't quite manage it. He was propped up against the wall. It let him see his legs twitch and jerk. The after effects of the cruciatus.

Voldemort dropped in front of him, and Percy recoiled for a moment because –

Because for a second, it seemed like Voldemort was covered in twisting, violent colors – like an abstract paining, all red and black and green.

But then the colors were gone and Percy was left blinking in fear and confusion. Was he going mad? Was he going to lose his wits?

Was he going to end up like the Longbottoms?

Voldemort smiled and then withdrew. "Severus, the veritaserum."

Percy started in fear. He couldn't help it. He could hope to hold out against a Cruciatus curse, but veritaserum? There was no hope for it.

A Death Eater approached him, and Percy tried to jerk away. He tried to escape, but then there were more hands on him, holding him still, and suddenly the colors were back in his vision. The Death Eater uniforms were no longer black, but they were a twisted, writhing mass of blood-red fire. And the men in the robes had charred black souls shot through with the yellow of fear.

Percy gave a hoarse shout because the colors were too much – they were too overwhelming – but then hands were on his face and… and the man in front of him had a verdant green soul.

"Green," Percy whispered, inanely, and then a vial was being forced into his mouth and suddenly the green was gone, and Severus Snape was in front of him.

Percy tried to struggle, just once, but then the potion was on his tongue. The taste was familiar – the bitter-sweet taste of the truth. Percy knew the taste of veritaserum, having sworn several oaths of office. He wasn't expecting the potion to sour on his tongue – but that's what it did. It left him grimacing, and then it left him surprised.

This wasn't veritaserum. Or rather, it wasn't just veritaserum.

Percy blinked a couple of times, integrating this new piece of information. Snape stepped back and Voldemort took his place.

"Names," said Voldemort. "Tell me the names of everyone in the Civis Arma."

The answers rose up in Percy's mouth. Me, he wanted to say. And you just killed the leader, John Kelley, there he is – one of the four that you killed.

Percy clamped his mouth shut, and surprisingly, it stayed shut.

"Tell me who you believe is in the Civis Arma," Voldemort amended.

Percy kept his mouth shut.

Voldemort's eyes seemed to flash, and suddenly Percy saw those colors again, and this time, he knew what they meant. Greasy black hatred. Yellow-green evil. Blood-red anger.

The colors married together, twisted and twirled together, and then they sparked brilliantly as Voldemort whirled on Snape. "Crucio!"

OoOoOoOoO

Ginny ran along side the civilians, wand out, waiting for trouble. She followed them up the stairwell from the tenth floor, into the atrium, and then towards the row of fireplaces. The flames were already lit – the destination set to the Auror Academy.

Ginny broke off from the group and stood guard with the two Aurors as the civilians pushed and shoved their way through the fireplace.

The ding of the only working lift was all the warning she got. Four Death Eaters emerged from the elevator, spells flying. The civilians screamed and panicked.

Ginny ran forward to meet them.

OoOoOoOoOo

They couldn't get to the seventh floor. Bill didn't understand it. It was just one floor above the atrium, but the stairway was completely walled off with something impenetrable. He'd tried all of his curse-breaking spells, and hadn't even made a dent in it.

If there had been more time, Bill could have studied the ward and figured out something. But they didn't have time. People were in danger and time meant lives.

Helen took them up the private stairwell – the one that went straight from the atrium to the Minister's office on the first floor.

And then they started working their way down.

They ran into the other strike teams on the third floor and combined forces and finally they began making real progress.

OoOoOoOoO

"It's pure, my lord, I swear!"

Percy sat huddled against the wall, gratefully forgotten as the Dark Lord tortured Severus Snape.

"Why isn't he talking?" Voldemort demanded.

"I don't know!" Snape pleaded. "But the potion is pure. I swear. Test it yourself and see!"

His form flared green again, and Percy tried to blink the color away. Aura, his mind supplied helpfully. The colors were auras. Trelawny had said that he should be able to see them.

A Death Eater was brought forward, a young man, hardly out of school. He was forced to his knees, and the veritaserum forced down his throat, and he suddenly started babbling – he was only a Death Eater because all of his friends were Death Eaters, and the Dark Lord terrified him, and there was actually this girl he liked, and she was really pretty, but she was a Muggle-born and –

The Avada flashed – the same yellow-green tone as the evil in Voldemort's soul. The Death Eater fell, and his soul colors – a little blue, a little red, a lot of yellow – went dark.

Percy blinked again, trying to push the auras away. They were distracting.

Voldemort turned to him. His chest was heaving with angry breaths and the blood-red in his aura flared so viciously that Percy couldn't help but flinch back.

"Tell me who is in the Civis Arma!" Voldemort demanded.

And the answers were there, on Percy's tongue, and he knew that if he opened his mouth the truth would spill out, like rain from a storm cloud. But he didn't want to answer Voldemort, so he clenched his jaw together and pressed his lips closed.

"Crucio!"

Percy was rocked back with the force of the curse. He slipped down the wall, unable to keep himself propped against it. He ground his teeth together, still not trusting the truth from spitting out, but then he couldn't keep the scream back anymore, so he screamed.

And then he was so busy screaming that he couldn't even thinking about speaking. The names were safe, as long as he screamed.

So he screamed.

He screamed over every name the potion wanted him to tell, including his own name. He screamed over every secret he had the Voldemort could use.

And he kept screaming.

OoOoOoOoO

Bill and Charlie reached the sixth floor – where Rudy had told them he'd last seen Percy. There was no sign of Percy, but there were Death Eaters. Too many Death Eaters.

Bill ducked behind a wall, grimacing as all of his curses got him no-where. He absently flexed his left hand. His arm had taken damage. It throbbed uncomfortably. He wiped the blood that dripped down his hand onto his trousers.

Charlie called out a few spells and then joined him, similarly stymied and similarly scuffed. He'd taken a wind charm to the chest and been knocked back over a desk. He had a few impressive scrapes and bruises, but they were both mobile and still at the top of their game.

"Hodgemon's offense, you think?" Charlie asked.

Bill was a little thrown by the Quidditch term, but then realized what Charlie was proposing. He shook his head. It wouldn't work. "Letterman's attempt," he countered.

"Hardly," Charlie said.

A barrage of curses hit the wall they were leaning against and the wall gave an alarming sort of crack.

As one, Bill and Charlie both darted out, sent out their own flurry of spells, and then ducked back down.

"Hodgemon's," Charlie said again.

"As if!"

Bill and Charlie both looked over. Helen Adams was crouched in the hallway opposite to them. Fred and George were behind her. Fred still looked a little pale, but he was upright and mobile again. Helen had done a top-rate job patching him up.

"Harry and Ron are coming in from the left," Helen said. "We are obviously pulling a Ferrara maneuver."

Bill considered that, and then nodded. "That could work."

"That's going to be brilliant," Charlie countered. He glanced over at Bill, his eyes bright. Charlie was always the most excited before something truly dangerous. "You ready?"

Bill opened his mouth to say yes, but then something twisted in his stomach. A dark and foreboding thought in the back of his head said something bad could happen. He paused for a moment.

Charlie grabbed his shoulder. "Percy could be down there."

Percy. Percy, their little brother who could be so smart, but also so stupid. Percy who tried so hard to fit in, he became awkward with his attempts. Percy who tried so hard to keep up with Bill and Charlie in friends and sports, but couldn't quite manage it. Percy who finally found success in his studies and then at work, and surpassed all of his brothers, but was so hungry for validation that he couldn't let anyone forget how successful he was until everyone was sick of hearing about it.

Percy who could be in trouble right now.

Bill sighed. "Okay."

He barely heard the countdown that Helen provided. He gripped his wand, sent up a quick prayer, and then they were moving in tandem. Bill and Charlie sent out of the first volley of curses, and then Helen and George provided the shielding. And then, when the Death Eaters were focused on them, Harry and Ron snuck around from the left and came at them hard and fast.

The Death Eaters fell back, caught unawares. They retreated down the hall, their movements chaotic and frantic. Bill moved forward with the others, pressing the advantage.

The stairwell door was ahead. They could get to the seventh floor.

Bill didn't know what had him glance behind.

Maybe it was that same dark feeling in his stomach, maybe it was a flash of something reflected off the wall, or maybe it was just the feeling that this was going too smoothly.

But he glanced behind them for one second and caught a glimpse of a black robe.

"Behind us!" he shouted, whirling all the way around, but he was too late.

The Death Eaters had caught them in a pincer move.

The yellow-green light of the Avada Kedavra curse filled the hall.

It flashed inches away from Bill.

It hit Charlie, still turning to meet the new threat.

Charlie dropped.

And Bill, not thinking, no longer present, grabbed his younger brother, not quite grasping what had happened.

There was shouting around them. Helen had stepped in front of Bill. She was expertly dueling the Death Eaters back. Harry and Ron were still keeping the first set of Death Eaters at bay.

"Into the office!" Helen demanded.

George and Fred pushed Bill back. A door was opened. Bill staggered backwards, into the empty office, still holding Charlie's body. The others ran in. The door was slammed shut. Helen stood guard, Harry taking position beside her.

Bill dropped onto the ground, Charlie's body cradled in his grasp. He looked up at his brothers – Ron, Fred, and George – their faces pale and shocked.

Bill looked back down at Charlie. His eyes were open, staring at nothing, his expression lax. Bill reached out, a strange urge to shake him awake – to scold him for playing a joke on them – because he couldn't be dead. Not Charlie.

He's gone, a voice said in his head. He's gone, and you're in trouble. Think, Bill. There will be time for crying later.

It sounded, oddly, like Draco's voice.

So Bill sucked in a breath and instead of patting Charlie's face, he gently closed his eyes. He looked back up at his brothers. "We need to get out of here."

OoOoOoOoO

Pain.

Percy screamed.

Colors and darkness flared in his vision, creating an impromptu fireworks display in his head. The colors were too bright and the darkness too encompassing.

He kept screaming and then finally realized that the pain had stopped.

The curse had been lifted. How long had it been stopped for? Seconds? Minutes?

Longer?

Percy caught his breath on a sob. He wanted to curl up, to shield himself from any more pain, but the movement only sent flares of heat up and down his body. He went still, but the marble was hard beneath his body. His overworked nerves told him he was lying on ice and it was bruising his skin.

"I can make the pain stop, Percy," came Voldemort's voice out of the blackness.

Percy tried to open his eyes, but the darkness remained, stubborn and unrelenting.

"I can make it stop if you tell me the names of those in the Civis Arma," Voldemort said. "An Avada curse, Percy. Quick, painless, and then nothing."

Percy choked back another sob. Merlin, he wanted it. He wanted to die.

There was the sense of movement around him. A hand touched his face, and then his neck. The touch was soft but it still caused a flare of fire on his skin. Percy tried not to scream because his throat was raw. He choked instead. Something hot flecked in his mouth. The taste of copper dripped over his tongue.

Blood.

Was his throat finally bleeding?

"He's half-dead, my lord," said the owner of the hands.

Percy tried to blink open his eyes and only saw green. Lush, steady green.

Green.

Severus Snape.

"He can't tell you anything in this condition."

"Is that so, Severus?" the Dark Lord purred.

There was the feeling of motion again. The soft brush of air that came with the flutter of a long robe.

Percy really wished he could open his eyes. The green figure was rising to his feet and falling back a few steps. The black, red, and yellow-green figure was advancing on him.

"Tell me, Severus, do you have another vial of veritaserum on you?" Voldemort asked.

"Yes, of course, my lord."

There was the sound of rustling robes. Percy blinked again, and shadowy forms appeared. He could see Severus Snape retrieve a vial from his robes and present it to Voldemort, but the sight was dim and slightly blurry. The colors were muted. It looked like a photo in a newspaper – a black and white image, slightly grainy, the movements ever-so-slightly stilted.

"Here, my lord."

Voldemort drew up to his fullest height. He leered down at the Potion's Professor. "Take it yourself, Severus."

"My lord?"

Percy knew that Snape must be acting. The veritaserum he had given Percy had been tainted, meaning that Snape was not a loyal member of the Death Eaters, but he sounded so surprised, so caught off guard, that Percy wouldn't have known he was acting without having proof.

"Take the veritaserum," Voldemort said. "And then tell me if the potion is pure."

Snape nodded. "Of course, my lord."

And again, he said it so sincerely, that Percy thought he was actually going to take the potion. And he uncorked the vial, put it to his lips, and then his hand was plunging into his robe pocket and he vanished.

Portkey, Percy thought, and then all thought vanished when Voldemort screamed in rage.

Fear. Fear spiked in Percy – and he could see it in the Death Eaters around him. They ducked and scurried as far back as they could, and alarm yellow flared up from their bodies.

And then Voldemort whirled towards Percy. "Crucio!"

The curse was inflicted with all of the rage and frustration and ire that Voldemort felt.

And Percy couldn't even draw breath to scream.

OoOoOoOoO

Ginny was hit by a ricocheting spell. It had once been a slicing hex, but she'd ducked behind a fallen pile of rubble. It bounced off the wall behind her, hit with a faint prickle of discomfort, and then she was up again and moving.

The Death Eaters had been sporadically trying to re-take the atrium for the past two hours. They were mostly unsuccessful.

Ginny couldn't help but think that this was a ploy, that they were sending just enough Death Eaters to take all of their attention away from what was happening further in the Ministry building. It made her nervous. It made her scared.

By all accounts, the self-destruct should have been activated by now.

If Voldemort got the Ministry…

If no one else was able to escape…

If Percy was still somewhere in the building…

She took all of her fear and turned it into anger. And that she turned into a blasting hex.

She took out both Death Eaters with the curse, strode over, and stunned them both, just to be sure they were out. Then she cast the incarcerous spell and took a moment to catch her breath.

The atrium was mostly empty. Only a few last remaining civilians were waiting to be Flooed out of the Ministry. Finn was standing with them – or rather, braced against the wall as he attempted to guard them. He'd taken spell-damage and couldn't quite stand on his own. Petrov had been injured as well, and had to be Flooed to St. Mungos.

They were down to one fireplace. The Death Eaters had been sure to target the fireplaces when they attacked.

There was a commotion by the side stairwell. Ginny glanced over, fingers tensing around her wand, but then she saw the red-robes of the Aurors. There were two of them, one leaning heavily on the other. Ginny recognized the injured Auror.

"Rudy!"

She ran forward and helped prop him up on the other side. He turned his head towards her. His eyes were glazed.

"W…Weasley," he said.

"That's right. Did the hair give it away?" Ginny asked, trying for lightheartedness.

"Others," said Rudy. "Others went…Percy…,"

"What about Percy?" Ginny demanded.

They reached the fireplace. The Auror cut to the front of the line but Ginny put out a hand, halting his exit.

"What about Percy?" she demanded.

"Went to self-destruct," Rudy told her. "Went to…,"

And then his eyes slipped shut. He went limp. The Auror caught him and stepped through the flames. Ginny watched them go, and then glanced around the nearly empty atrium. Only a few Aurors and civilians remained. The evacuation was as complete as it could be but still the Ministry was standing.

Ginny quickly slipped into a small nook in the atrium that housed a statue of the first Minister. She pulled out the necklace she wore underneath her shirt and clasped her hand around the pale pink rose hanging from the fine chain.

She closed her eyes and thought, help me.

She opened her eyes. Nothing.

She reclasped her hand and thought harder, louder, Find me. Help me.

Still nothing.

Ginny sighed. Perhaps it had been foolish to hope that –

"You do not appear to be in any distress, Miss Weasley."

Ginny turned. Lucius Malfoy stood behind her, dressed in blue and gray robes. His long hair was brushed and gleaming. He carried a serpent-headed cane in hand.

Ginny hadn't seen him, not in four years since he had rescued her from Claire. She knew that he had been spotted in different areas around England. She knew that no one quite knew what he was. He wasn't a ghost. But he wasn't alive, either.

"My brother is in trouble," she said.

Lucius looked irked. "I'm not the Aurors, Miss Weasley. And don't you think you have enough brothers? If you need a rescue mission-,"

"Percy," Ginny interrupted. "Assistant to the Minister. He was trying to set off the self-destruct in the Ministry."

Lucius tipped his head ever-so-slightly to the side. "Ah. That brother. The useful one. That does change things." He looked at her, considering. "You'll owe me a favor."

"Of course," Ginny said, quickly, easily.

Lucius smiled, somewhat mercenary, but then he nodded. "We have a deal, Miss Weasley."

And then he vanished. Ginny let out a breath. She knew that she might have just made a deal with the closest approximation to the devil, but all she felt was relief.

OoOoOoOoOoO

Bill slammed the door shut again. He threw up some rather illegal shielding charms.

He dropped back on the floor, those few moments of furious spell-casting leaving him exhausted. There were dozens of Death Eaters outside the door. He didn't know how they were getting out of this one.

Charlie's body lay beside the wall. His jacket was draped over his face. Fred sat beside Charlie's body, his face pale from blood loss. His injury had re-opened.

Bill took a few minutes to catch his breath and to think. He wasn't losing another brother today.

OoOoOoOoO

Pain.

Percy was sure there was pain, but it was different somehow. His head felt foggy. It felt like he was floating.

Floating in fire, but it was too dark for there to be fire.

He was surrounded by blackness.

The pain stopped. Percy hardly twitched.

"Tell me the names," a voice demanded, shooting through the blackness with a flash of blood-red anger.

"Names," Percy repeated, his voice cracked and hoarse. What names?

There were hands on him. They hauled him upright. Percy couldn't stand, couldn't get his feet under him. He was surrounded by angry-red and scared-yellow souls.

"I will enjoy killing you," the voice said.

Percy's brain turned over, processing. Voldemort. That was Voldemort. And these were Death Eaters.

And he was seeing auras now.

And… and he couldn't see anything else. Apart from the colors, there was only dark.

Black.

Nothing.

"But first, you will tell me what you know!" Voldemort thundered.

Percy could see his Voldemort's aura move, could see the outline of him. He was pulling his arm back, ready to strike, and then there was a splash of gray that appeared in the midst of the red and yellow.

"I do hope I'm not interrupting," drawled the newcomer. His tone was all condescension and insolence.

The red-anger in Voldemort sparked. "Lucius!"

"Hello, Tom," said the gray figure that was Lucius Malfoy.

Percy could see the silhouette of Voldemort bristling and rounding on Malfoy. "I thought I had killed you," Voldemort hissed.

"I killed myself, you pretionious arse," Lucius snapped, his voice irritated and testy.

"Then why are you here?" Voldemort demanded.

"I told you," Lucius said. "I told that I'd simply refuse to die. You didn't listen to me. You rarely do. In fact, I remember telling you, back when you wanted to take the Ministry, that the very best thing to do was lie low and pretend that you didn't exist. And then, once everyone was lured into a false sense of complacency, you could make your move. But you didn't wait. Now look at the mess you've gotten yourself into."

"Avada Kedavra!" Voldemort bellowed.

Percy could see the green light of the cruse. He saw it hit the gray form and then pass through, as if the gray form was nothing more than smoke. The curse hit the Death Eater behind Lucius. The Death Eater dropped. Lucius remained standing.

"That doesn't work on my anymore," said Lucius.

Percy was dropped to the floor. There were cries of 'demon' and 'ghost' and 'impossible'. He could see the forms of the Death Eaters draw their wands, but they waited. They waited for Voldemort.

"The Ministry has been evacuated. It won't be long until the Aurors re-form and strike a counter-offensive," said Lucius. "You can hold them off, to be sure, but it will be costly. How badly do you want this Ministry?"

"It is mine!" Voldemort declared, enraged.

Lucius shrugged. "Have it your way, if you must."

The gray form stepped around Voldemort and then towards Percy. Percy blinked as the form knelt down. Hands brushed across his face. Percy knew that Lucius should be ghost-like. He was dead after all, but the hands were warm. The fingers gentle.

"I think you've killed him," said Lucius.

"He'll live to tell his secrets," Voldemort promised, his aura twisting into colors truly repulsive.

But Lucius was gray. Gray must be better than black, red, and yellow-green, so Percy reached up, grabbed onto silk robes, and pulled Lucius closer.

"Kill me," he whispered, voice barely more than a breath of air.

"Don't be so dramatic," said Lucius, and then something was secreted into his hand.

That was his wand. He knew it immediately.

"You know what to do," said Lucius. "Your eleven o'clock. About two meters off the floor."

Lucius was referring to the grand clock that hung on the wall. For all of its gilded gold and sparkling gems, it looked benign, harmless, but it housed the self-destruct to the Ministry. Percy wondered how Lucius knew that secret. Then again, Voldemort had discovered that secret as well, so perhaps he shouldn't be too surprised. Percy tucked the wand in his robe sleeve.

Lucius got up and walked away from Percy and towards the left, drawing the attention of Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

"You know, you could have used veritaserum on him, if you actually wanted him to tell you something," Lucius told Voldemort.

Lucius couldn't have known that Voldemort had done just that. He was obviously just trying to bait the Dark Lord and had stumbled upon a fresh wound. Voldemort snarled in rage, and lunged at Lucius. He passed right through the gray form – and that was Percy's cue.

He pointed his wand, hoping for eleven o'clock and two meters off the floor. He shouted out of a hoarse and broken throat, "Morituri te salutamus."

He could tell the spell hit because there was an explosion so bright it pierced the black that had been surrounding his vision. The entire building shook, and then the screeching banshee alarm started, earsplitting in its volume and pitch.

Above the screeching, he could hear the Death Eaters shouting and cursing. Alarm-yellow spiked out of their souls.

Voldemort flared red-angry. His shout of rage seemed to shake the floor, and Percy could see his form, could see him level his wand in his direction. Voldemort shouted a curse – a vicious red-looking curse – but then a gray form slipped in front of him. The spell was deflected.

Voldemort bellowed his rage again, but then a Death Eater caught his sleeve. "Please, my lord, we must go!"

"I'll kill you, Lucius!" Voldemort thundered, and then he disappeared with a crack of lightning.

The Death Eaters pooled together in groups. Their black and yellow souls were whisked away by portkey.

OoOoOoOoO

The banshee alarm was so sudden that Bill jumped. He wasn't the only one.

For a brief second, he believed there was an actual banshee in the room with them, but then he realized what the alarm actually meant.

"The self-destruct!" Harry said.

"The Death Eaters will be leaving," Helen said. She stepped to the door, wand out. "We'll have to be fast."

Bill nodded. "You and I will take the lead. Fred, Harry, you're behind us." He turned to George and Ron. They nodded, not needing words to know what they would do.

They would carry Charlie out.

OoOoOoO

Percy slumped on the floor. There were no Death Eaters any more. Just the screeching of the alarm.

And darkness.

The gray form moved throughout the black to kneel beside him. "You only have a few minutes to escape."

Percy nodded against the marble. It was cold against his forehead, a relief from the fire that seemed to override his body.

"You do need to get out of the building," Lucius remarked.

Percy pulled in a breath. "I can't see."

"So I have realized," said Lucius. "I find it hard to believe, however, that you'd let a trivial thing like that do you in."

Percy swore at him, as loudly as possible with his screamed-out voice. But he pushed himself up. His legs threatened to buckle.

A hand caught his arm. Percy let Lucius Malfoy stabilize him as his body trembled. Sweat broke out over his body.

"I don't," he started, and then stopped and had to think. He struggled to orient himself. "Where are the stairs?"

"To your right," said Lucius.

Percy began moving, slowly. The building shook again and Percy was knocked to the floor. He caught himself on his hands and knees and the impact made him cry out in pain.

"As much as I'd love to make a habit of rescuing Weasley's in distress, I've overtaxed my powers for now," said Lucius.

Percy turned his head. The gray figure was flickering in and out.

"You'll have to do all the heavy lifting, I'm afraid," Lucius said.

"You've made my life very difficult," Percy told him, and then pushed himself to his feet again. His stomach churned. He staggered over in the direction he hoped the wall was, ended up hitting it with his shoulder, and then vomited over the floor.

"No doubt," said Lucius pleasantly.

Percy spat and then wiped his mouth on his robe sleeve. He tried to avoid the puddle of vomit and was stupidly pleased when he was actually successful. He moved again towards the stairs.

"About twenty more steps, straight ahead," said Lucius.

Percy counted out the steps. The screeching alarm intensified. He fumbled for the door to the stairwell.

"Down and to your left," said Lucius, directing him to the door handle. "And I believe you're on your own now. Best wishes, Mr. Weasley."

Percy looked over just as the gray form flickered out completely and did not reappear. But he found the door handle and pushed the door open. If he remembered correctly, the emergency portkey that was stationed on every floor for medical emergencies would be on the left wall.

The building shook again. He had only seconds left. He began feeling his way carefully along the wall. His fingers hit the glass case inserted into the wall. He pulled the case open and fumbled inside for the emergency portkey. His fingers hit it. Something lurched him backwards, and the portkey was too much for him to handle. His mind faded out.

The world went blacker than before.

OoOoOoOoOoO

Quick Note: Well – that whole process took longer than expected. And there are still things to find out – such as, why didn't Percy go to Charlie's funeral? And why do the Weasley's think that Percy killed Charlie. So I think the next chapter will finish this bit up, and then we'll be back at Draco and his memories. Sorry for the long detour.

Also – ugh! Charlie! Why did I kill you? I mean, I know why, but you were really cool! Never let it be said that author's regret nothing...





10. The Aftermath: Part I

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. Or any of the rest of the characters for that matter…

Author's Note: Late. Late late late.

OoOoOoOoO

One year ago…

Percy ached.

He didn't know how he still ached when he'd been given three different pain relieving potions and two anti-inflammatories, but he did.

The Healer had said he'd be sore for a while. She'd said that he'd been lucky, that if he'd been held any longer under the Cruciatus, he would have suffered permanent muscle damage. As it was, he'd been given two muscle re-knitters and two muscle relaxants to help his torn and strained ligaments. His entire body felt like a wet dishrag, limp and wrung out.

His mind was active though. More than active. It was spinning and racing and he almost regretted not taking the sedative he'd been offered.

But he'd already been asleep for eight hours. In that space of time, Percy had been assigned a protection detail, moved to Greenfriar Town Hospital, and been put through an array of scans.

In that time, the country was still panicking.

Percy had thought he'd be able to do something. Even with his eyesight still gone, he'd be able to do something. He could have reports read to him with a reading charm, or use a dict-a-quill to send messages. He'd already spoke briefly to Kingsley and the remaining cabinet members, via magic mirror. He'd given them his report, he'd told them about Voldemort, and the self-destruct, and the officials already dead, but he couldn't see their reactions to know what they made of it. To know what they made of him. Had he done enough? Should he have tried something different?

Kingsley had simply told him to rest, had told him to sleep and recover, but Percy needed some sort of distraction. All he had was the radio. It kept playing the same news over and over again, with very little variation, because very little was happening now that the initial attack was over.

Percy reached to the side, where he knew a glass of water was sitting. His fingers hit the side of the table. He moved them up to the surface, fumbled for the glass of water, and clasped his fingers around it. He lifted and felt his arm shake with effort. The glass slipped from his hand. It shattered on the floor – Percy knew that because he could hear the sound of breaking glass. And he could also hear the sound of the door being flung open, and then he could see a burst of orange-yellow. The Auror on guard duty had rushed in, alarm rising up in his aura.

"Just dropped a glass," Percy said, his voice gravelly and cracked in a way it never was before. That was because he'd nearly torn his vocal chords by screaming.

"Not a problem, sir," the Auror said.

Percy dropped back against the pillows as the Auror whisked up his mess. Through the open door he could hear the bustle of an overtaxed hospital. Alarms blared. Voices called out – insistent and demanding. Someone was crying down the hall, deep, wrenching sobs.

St. Mungo's had been overwhelmed by the casualties, Percy knew that much. The wounded had been shipped to every hospital around the country and even then, the wizarding hospital system would be close to overtaxed. Greenfriar was the site of the Minister's vacation home and the secondary Ministry-site. Other officials would have been sent here, not just Percy.

"Here you go, sir." The Auror handed him a fresh glass of water, wrapping Percy's hand around it. Percy could feel his hand still shake as he raised it to his lips. He took a few desperate gulps. The water felt good sliding down his throat but then it pooled in his stomach, feeling cold and heavy.

Percy felt sweat break out over his brow. He hurriedly handed the glass back and the Auror placed it back on the table.

"Should I get a Healer?"

Percy shook his head. "No. Just… just tired."

He could see the silhouette of the Auror nod. "I'll be right outside, sir."

The Auror left, closing the door behind him, and the sounds of the hospital were muffled once more. Percy dropped back against the pillows, listened to the drone of the radio, and tried to sleep.

He may have nodded off for a few minutes, or at the very least, closed his eyes, because the next thing he was aware of was the sound of the door opening.

"Percy? It's Henry James."

Percy blinked a couple of times, his body automatically trying to see, stupidly forgetting that his eyes didn't work right now. The Ministry's private Healer was nothing more than a blue and green figure in the blackness.

"Healer James," said Percy, trying to push himself up. His left arm gave out, making him slump awkwardly.

The Healer was immediately by his side, plumping up several pillows behind him while surreptitiously casting several diagnostic charms. Percy was always impressed at the Healer's ability to multitask.

"How is everyone?" Percy asked, once the Healer stepped back. "What's the…," he paused, trying to find a way to phrase it delicately, and then gave up and settled for blunt, "How many dead?"

"While I admire your work ethic, now is not the time to read you casualty reports," said James. "You've been through enough of a crisis. You need to focus on healing."

Percy wanted to protest, but he knew that nothing would sway the Healer when he used that sort of voice. He sighed instead. "Well, what's the verdict on me, then?"

"Your muscles are healing nicely. Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels are within normal range. You'll be taking anti-inflammatories, muscle re-knitters, and muscle relaxants for the next two weeks, but give a couple more days of bed rest, and your body should be well on the way to recovery."

Percy decided not to object to bed-rest, and instead focused on what the Healer didn't say. "What about my vision?"

James leaned in and waved something in front of his face. Percy couldn't see what it was, but he did see the Healer's hand, a mix of aqua and cerulean, dart back and forth in front of him.

"You appear to be tracking movement, but your pupils aren't responsive to light," said James. "And you aren't focusing on anything, are you?"

Percy sighed. "Has anyone told you that you have a very aquatic soul?"

James paused. Percy wondered what the pause meant. Usually he was good at reading body language and facial expressions. Now there was nothing, just a faint stirring of something orange and pink. Percy didn't know what those colors meant.

"Being an aura-reader wasn't in your medical file," James said, voice neutral.

"It's a… recently discovered talent," Percy said. "But I'd really like to get back to actually seeing things again, and not just random colors. I'm assuming there's some unpleasant medical procedure for that?"

There was another beat of silence. More colors changed in James' aura. A blue-gray color welled up in the center of James' chest. It was a sad, dreary sort of color. If Percy had to assign an emotion to it, he'd say it looked like grief.

"Oh," said Percy, recognizing what James was able to tell him. The world seemed to twist beneath him.

"I'm so sorry, Percy," James said. "The Cruciatus caused swelling and bleeding in your brain. Had you been held under any longer, it's likely you would have suffered a stroke or a brain hemorrhage. As it is, however, the occipital cortex in your brain was damaged. Although your eyes weren't injured, your brain lacks the ability to process what your eyes are seeing."

Percy swallowed hard. "And there's nothing that can be done?"

James reached out and grabbed his arm. He squeezed lightly. "I've sent for a specialist to fit you for a vision aid. They'll look just like a pair of glasses – maybe a little thicker than your usual prescription – but you'll be able to see with them. Maybe not perfectly, but pretty damn close."

It wasn't what Percy wanted to hear, but he forced himself to nod. "Of course. Thank you, Healer James."

The blue-gray spread even further, like water, like an entire ocean. Percy glanced away, not wanting to see the other man's sympathy, not when he was so caught up in his own pain.

"Can I call someone for you, Percy?" the Healer asked. "A friend? A family member?"

Percy thought once of his mother. And then he thought of Charlie. Charlie would come, if Percy asked. He opened his mouth, but couldn't quite get the name out. He shook his head instead.

"No. I… I think I'd just like to be alone for a while."

He glanced over enough to see the Healer nod. "Get some rest, Assistant."

The Healer left the room. Percy closed his eyes, noticing no difference in the blackness when his eyes were shut, and felt hot tears fall down his face.

Present day…

Pansy didn't know what to do.

She'd found the memory she was looking for, but it was completely different than what she had expected. She had been looking for the memory that the Weasley family was sure existed. She was looking for the memory of Percy hiding during the battle, of being a coward. She was looking for proof that as Charlie was fighting to save Percy's life, Percy was being the sniveling, self-serving rat that his entire family believed he was.

She had wanted to find evidence of his cowardice. She had wanted to find it, drag it out, and then broadcast that memory to the world. She had wanted to proclaim, "Here is the reason Charlie is dead!" and then feel some relief from the never-ending grief that flowed through her.

But she hadn't found that memory. Instead she had discovered that Percy Weasley was brave. Percy Weasley was self-sacrificing. Percy Weasley was a hero.

And so Pansy found no relief. Instead, there was only guilt for what she had done.

Pansy got up, intend on getting her glass of wine from the kitchen, but the mess on the floor stopped her short. The china cabinet was knocked over – the dishes saved by an unbreakable charm – unlike Percy's wine glass. The guilt compelled her to whisk away the mess and right the china cabinet. And then she found a small first aid kit in the bathroom and returned to the living room.

Percy was still passed out on the floor, half crumpled and half folded in on himself. She levitated him to the couch and then settled down at his feet. She pulled off his sock and carefully pulled the piece of glass from the arch of his foot. He had surprisingly nice feet. Not like Charlie. Charlie had horrible feet. Tough calluses on his soles. A few blisters from his heavy work boots. Toenails that were never trimmed evenly. Bits of dirt that never quite washed away. Percy's feet, however, were clean, slender, and well-shaped. She placed a medicated bandage on the cut, and then she was stuck with nothing to do.

And she still felt guilty.

She was unaccustomed to the emotion and she didn't like it. She hated feeling it. She glared at the unconscious form on the couch and felt it turn into anger instead. What, in the name of Merlin, had Percy Weasley been thinking, inviting her to his house? If he was so smart, why did he let her in? He knew she was a dangerous woman. He knew she must have been a threat to him.

And why didn't he just go to Charlie's funeral instead of accepting that damned award?

And why didn't he tell anyone what had happened at the Ministry? Why didn't he tell his parents? Why didn't the media know that the Assistant Minister had been tortured by Voldemort? Why had the Ministry reported that he'd suffered only minor injuries in the battle?

Well, she could guess at the last few questions. The Ministry wouldn't want the general public to know that Voldemort had been in the Ministry itself, and that he had somehow learned and targeted the officials who could activate the self-destruct. That would have made the entire country feel threatened and vulnerable.

But why hadn't he told his family at least? Why didn't they know that he was…

Blind.

Percy Weasley was blind.

He'd been blinded in the battle and no one even knew about it.

Her anger spiked again. Why the hell wouldn't he have told his family?

She jostled his leg. "Wake up."

Nothing.

She reached over and shook his shoulder. "Percy Weasley, wake up."

Nothing.

She sighed, pointed her wand, and said, "Navitus."

Percy woke with a start. One moment he was prone on the couch, the next he had jerked up, gasping in fear. His eyes were wild behind his glasses. He saw her, lurched back, and tried to roll off the couch, but his actions were clumsy and disjointed. He was still half-sedated from the drugged wine.

She sighed and grabbed his arms to keep him from tipping off of the couch. In hindsight, it wasn't the best move because it made him struggle harder. He grunted a little, tried to pull back, tried to squirm away.

"Calm down!" Pansy snapped.

He didn't listen, just pushed at her harder, but Pansy knew how to pin a struggling man to a sofa. She straddled him and caught his arms between her legs.

Percy froze. Pansy could feel the tension thrum throughout his body. She watched his eyes stare up at her behind his thick glasses. He was getting faint lines by his eyes. His job was aging him.

"Are you calmed down?" she asked.

She watched Percy lick his lips and felt him tremble a little bit. "What do you want?" he asked.

There was a lot Pansy wanted. She wanted Charlie back, first and foremost, but that wasn't going to happen, so instead she wanted someone to punish for his death. She had thought she had that in Percy. At least until a couple minutes ago.

"Why didn't you go to Charlie's funeral?" she asked.

Percy blinked at her. His brow knit. "I don't understand."

She leaned in, reached out towards his face, and saw the flash of fear when her fingers grasped his glasses.

"Don't-," he said, bucking up underneath her. He wasn't able to find any leverage.

She pulled the glasses off his face and watched how his eyes lost focus and skipped about the room. The dull blue irises turned to her, and she realized that perhaps 'dull' was the wrong descriptor. His eyes weren't a true blue. They were more of a blue-gray, like the ocean on a cloudy day. She wondered, briefly, what he was seeing in her aura right now.

She leaned in and pressed her hands to the side of his face, keeping him facing her.

"Why weren't you at Charlie's funeral?" she asked again.

He sighed. He closed his eyes and then started talking.

One year ago…

"How about now?" the eye-specialist asked, handing the glasses back.

Percy couldn't see the glasses, but he could see the specialist's hand – a russet and brown silhouette. The specialist appeared to be made up of an autumnal palette.

It was only a small matter of fumbling to grasp the glasses and then slip them back onto his face. The world suddenly appeared before him. Instead of reds and browns, the specialist was a thin, reedy man with a ruddy complexion and a fondness for purple.

"Clearer?" the specialist asked.

Percy looked around the hospital room. The lines were much clearer, in fact, they were perfectly defined, as opposed to the last try when everything looked out-of-focus. "Much better," he agreed. "It is still dim though. Like the lights are on half-strength."

"The vision aid won't be perfect," the specialist said. "Dim is par for the course. If you're seeing clearly, and if you have good distance vision and close-up vision, then these glasses are working better for you than eighty percent of my clients. We're going to have to call this one a victory."

Percy nodded, but a little reluctantly. Part of him felt guilty that he wasn't more grateful for the specialist's help. The other part of him raged that, instead of just needing glasses to read, now he needed them to see. And not even perfectly at that.

"There are a few side effects you may notice," the specialist said. "Eyestrain is pretty common. Some people need to introduce the glasses slowly, wearing them an hour at a time to get accustomed to the lenses. Try not to wear them more than twelve hours at a time without an hour or so to rest your eyes. One of the most common complaints is headaches, so don't be afraid to take a mild pain reliever when needed."

Percy gave him a dark look. "I have migraines already."

The specialist winced a little. "Definitely talk with your private Healer about medications then. We do usually find that migraine sufferers report more headaches than usual with the glasses."

Percy sighed a little, but forced a pleasant smile on his face. "Thank you for your help."

"Not at all," said the specialist. "We'll meet in a month for a follow-up." He gathered up the various lenses and frames he had brought with him and stood to leave. "And can I just say, you're a real hero, Assistant Minister. I'm sorry that this happened to you."

Percy blinked in surprise, because – what?

The specialist nodded and left the hospital room, leaving Percy torn between confusion and depression. The depression won because it was the most pressing. Percy looked about the hospital room, plain, generic, boring, and then pulled the glasses off. The room disappeared. Only blackness remained.

It was terrifying.

Percy slipped the glasses back on. He couldn't stay here anymore. He needed to do something.

He gingerly pushed himself up out of the hospital bed. His body protested. The heavy potions he'd been given yesterday had worn off. His skin felt raw. His nerves felt exposed. He made his way carefully to the small bathroom attached to the hospital room. A hot shower eased the strain in his muscles. He had to wear his glasses in the shower, but the hot water helped him ignore the current distress he felt. There were more pressing things to worry about – like the state of the country. There was no time to curl up in a ball and cry.

He finished showering. He changed out of the hospital gown into a change of clothes he'd had sent over. A quick spell smoothed out his hair, and then he was ready. He strode out of the hospital room.

A new Auror was with him today. Percy recognized him as part of the usual guard at the Ministry, but couldn't quite recall his name. The Auror nodded and then fell in step beside him as Percy headed towards the Healer's station.

The hospital was crowded. There were still patients in the hall. Percy had to side-step around stretchers and around slumbering forms of family members who were keeping loved ones company.

A few of them looked up as Percy walked by. A whispering started, and then someone started clapping.

Percy paused for a moment, wondering who was being clapped at, and then suddenly the hall was full of applause. Percy turned to the Auror, the question on his face. The Auror smiled a little and shrugged. "They're not clapping for me, sir."

"Bless you, Assistant!" one voice called out.

"Thank you, Assistant!" another patient exclaimed.

"Assistant Minister!"

"Merlin bless you!"

Percy felt heat steal over his face. What on earth were they clapping for? He understood shows of patriotism after a national tragedy, but Percy was hardly famous. He was the Assistant. His job was the boring, tedious sort of work that never got reported on in the papers.

"Bless you, Assistant Minister!" a woman called from a stretcher, reaching out her hand.

Percy automatically reached for her hand to shake. He couldn't help but notice that her leg was missing below her knee. A man sat beside her – presumably her husband. He reached out for a handshake as well.

"Thank you, Assistant Minister," he said.

Percy nodded, not quite sure how to respond to the thanks, and then suddenly other patients and family members crowded forwards. Hands reached out for him for him to clasp or shake. His name was called out. People shouted out their gratitude. A few flashes blinked out - photographs.

The Auror stepped out in front of him. "Alright, come on and let the Assistant through, yeah? He's not here for the fun of it."

The Auror began gently pushing the crowd back. A few medi-witches stepped in as well and Percy began edging through the crowd, still shaking hands and nodding, all the way to the Healer's kiosk at the end of the hall.

"Assistant Minister," the Healer on duty said, startled. "You really shouldn't be up."

"I'm checking out," Percy said.

"I really can't advise-,"

"I'll follow up with the Ministry Healers," Percy said. "And I'll sign whatever forms you need me to, but I've a job that needs attending."

There was a little more bluster, a few more faint reproaches, but the papers finally appeared in front of him. Percy signed and then was directed to the Healer's break room that had a private Floo. Percy had to call out both the address to Greenfriar Manor and the password that kept the premise secure. He stepped through the fireplace, the Auror following behind him.

Greenfriar Manor was an old home donated to the Ministry after the last Greenfriar died without an heir. It was not the largest of old wizarding estates, but it was one of the most opulent. And the conditions of the will stated that the home must be kept as authentic as possible. It quickly became the Minister's summer home and private retreat. And it was also the designated secondary Ministry site – not that anyone really thought it'd ever be used as such.

Percy stepped out into Greenfriar's entry hall and immediately noticed the heightened security. Several old suits of armor immediately snapped to attention – the ancient guardians of the estate – and half a dozen Aurors did as well.

"Sir," one Auror said, gesturing him forward to a security desk.

Percy stepped up to the desk and started the tedious process of proving his identity. Not that he believed it was unnecessary. Violetta Gabny had not been herself the other day when she had attacked them, and Percy hadn't noticed anything off until she tried killing them.

His voice patterns were confirmed, a magical anti-concealment charm swept over him, a hair pluck from his head for scanning, and finally he gave his personal password to the security officer.

"Welcome back, sir," the officer said once he'd successfully proven his identity, and ushered him through the security checkpoint.

"Assistant Minister!" Lindsay Peters gasped. She bolted up from her reception desk, her hands flying to her face. "We were told not to expect you until next week!"

She ran forward, and for a moment, Percy was afraid she was going to hug him. She stopped herself, just barely, but she did reach out and clasp his hand.

"It's so good to see you," she said.

"Thank you," said Percy. "Is Gleason in?"

"Upstairs in his office," said Lindsey. "I can call up, and let him know you're coming."

"No, don't," said Percy. "I'd hate to ruin the surprise."

Lindsay paused. "Surprise?" she asked, her voice holding just a little bit of apprehension.

Percy's animosity with the press secretary was well known.

Percy didn't answer her, just headed up to the second floor. The staircase was a large, overly grand affair that split in two directions. Percy followed the right branch of the staircase to what had once been the large drawing room and study but now housed the secretary of the press and his media minions.

Percy paused for a moment in the doorway. Gleason was easy to spot. His voice carried through the entire room. Percy didn't care for Gleason. He was far too dramatic, far too willing to spin a story, and far too conniving for Percy to really trust him. But even Percy had to admit that he made one hell of a press secretary. He had an innate sense for story, and a way of stirring the public to whatever opinion he chose.

Gleason was the only one who could make people clap for Percy.

Gleason was currently in the corner of the room, standing over one of his typists. He was speaking to her but orating to the entire room, his hands waving as he talked, holding everyone captivated to his story.

Everyone except Percy that is.

"Gleason!" Percy snapped out his name as he stepped into the room.

All sound and movement stopped. All occupants turned to Percy. A faint, "Oh, shit" sounded from the other side of the room. Everyone immediately tried to look busy.

Gleason pivoted around to him, a look of irritation on his face. "You're not supposed to be here, Weasley. You need to be in the hospital."

Despite how his words could be construed, there was no concern in them. Just annoyance that Gleason's pawns weren't where he wanted them to be.

Percy stepped further in the room. "Why are people clapping for me?"

Gleason shrugged. "How the hell should I know?"

"I was mobbed at the hospital," said Percy. "There were a great many thank you's, a great many handshakes, and a whole lot of crying going on. Care to explain?"

A pleased smile flitted across Gleason's face. "There were, were there?" he asked.

"People took photos," said Percy.

"Did you look injured enough?"

Percy narrowed his eyes. "What?"

"The public knows that you were gravely injured in the battle at the Ministry," said Gleason. "So, did you have any visible bandages? Any blood?"

"I look as I do now," said Percy. "Is there a reason you want me in costume?"

"To sell the story of course." Gleason strode forward, waved his hand in front of Percy, and let out a sound of discontent. "But now you've mostly likely gone and ruined it."

"Ruined what?" Percy demanded, but Gleason just swept passed him and headed to his desk.

"Your moment of triumph, of course."

Percy spun around to follow him and belatedly realized, as the room spun as well and then didn't stop spinning, that it hadn't been the smartest of moves. He stumbled a little, trying to find his equilibrium in the midst of his vertigo, and then Gleason was back right beside him, grabbing onto his arm.

"Merlin, Weasley," he said, a note of actual concern in his voice.

The room slowly stopped rotating beneath him. Percy blinked a little, and then carefully extracted his arm from Gleason's grip. He stayed upright. Percy let out a breath of relief and watched as Gleason's concern gave way to something more conniving.

"Tell me you looked as pale then as you do now. Because you look even better than gravely injured. You look half-dead, and the papers will buy that photo and spread it in the gossip rags."

Percy glowered. "Just tell me what you did so I can fire you."

Gleason grabbed a paper from one of the many stacks in the office and smacked it into his chest. Percy looked down at the headline. 'The Ministry Falls' was splashed over the front page. There was a photo of a wall of flames shooting up in the atrium while people ran in terror. Some more heroically inclined people ran towards the flames and – was that Ginny?

Gleason tapped the page, bringing Percy's attention to the side article. As Press Secretary, Gleason didn't write the articles himself, but he heavily influenced the news that was reported. This headline read 'Assistant Minister Injured While Saving England'. Underneath the headline was a photo of Percy. It was his official photo, the one taken in front of the flag.

Percy skimmed the article. It mentioned nothing of Voldemort. It mentioned nothing of the other dead Ministry officials, the ones who had been targeted and murdered as they tried to hit the self-destruct. It said nothing of the other heroes.

The story itself was ridiculous. It cast Percy in the role of some rugged hero who fought through an entire burning building of Death Eaters in order to initiate the building's failsafe. It was a story more suited to an over-the-top radio program or pulpy-action novel.

"By the wand of Merlin," Percy breathed out in disgust. He looked up at Gleason. "What the hell sort of garbage is this?"

"The people of England are scared, desperate, and mourning. They need a hero."

"They have Potter."

"This wasn't Potter's house that burned down," Gleason countered. "This was the Ministry of Magic and we needed a Ministry hero. We're already playing up the brave men and women of the Auror department – and thank Merlin that the Costace kid is pretty enough to have a rabid fanbase – but we needed our own Potter. You know, glasses, nerdy, the unexpected hero. Men don't feel threatened by you, and women will probably want to take you home and feed you – all very good for the public morale."

Percy stared at Gleason in distaste. "You're fired."

He dropped the paper down on the desk, carefully turned, and left the office. He would have liked to spin on his heel and stride out of the room, but he was learning that sudden motion made for vertigo.

"Only the Minister can fire me!" Gleason called after him.

Percy flipped him a rude gesture, a rather juvenile move, admittedly, and heard a few gasps behind him because, well, Percy was the very definition of mature. Percy headed up to the third floor, passing by several more Aurors who – weirdly enough – saluted him as he walked by.

It just irked Percy even more. Surely others deserved that sort of honor more than he did. What about those who had died? What about those still in the hospital?

And had Percy truly done anything heroic? He'd been captured, tortured, and then needed a rescue by Lucius Malfoy of all people. Percy paused for a moment, and felt something very dark stir in his chest.

"Alright, sir?" an Auror asked him.

Percy glanced over. The Auror couldn't be more than eighteen, a young cherubed face sort of boy. He sighed a little. "For varying definitions of the word," he said.

oOoOoOo

Ron stared at the paper on the table, breakfast was cold and forgotten in front of him. There was a lot of breakfast. Molly was still in the kitchen, cooking.

The paper was entirely focused on the fall of the Ministry and there was an article about Percy on the front page. Everyone had read it. At first it was because they were scared. The paper said 'gravely injured'. What if Percy was dying?

But then it became obvious that Percy was not dying. He was in the hospital in 'stable' condition. And the article was all wrong. The article said that Percy had traveled through the entire Ministry on his own, that he had faced down Death Eaters and basilisks and werewolves, but Ron had done that. Ron and the other Order members had done that, and they hadn't seen Percy.

And Charlie had died. Charlie had died saving Percy, and now the paper was making Percy out to be some hero, someone who had single-handedly saved the Ministry and –

And Percy had always liked to talk about what he was doing. Ron's memories of Percy were always full of his boastings, usually at the dinner table, trying to get attention, things like, "I encouraged the Prefects to change the curfew regulations at Hogwarts. It will be so much more efficient now" and 'I wrote into the NEWTS because their last question on the test could have been answered two different ways, and they agreed I had a point and were going to change it" and "I just got hired as the Junior Assistant to the Minister! Can you believe it? I'm going to be working at the Ministry. With the Minister himself!"

That last one had led to an argument because everyone knew that Fudge was ridiculous, but Percy was so stupidly pleased with himself, he wanted everyone else to be jealous of him.

A small part of Ron related to that. It was hard, being best friends with Harry Potter sometimes. Ron found himself wanting to explain his own triumphs in detail, to get validation. So he couldn't blame Percy for being a prick, but…

But this was taking it too far.

"That's not what happened," said George, dropping his paper onto the table.

"Not at all," Fred agreed, still a little pale and recovering from his injuries.

Ron sighed. What was Percy thinking, lying to the papers?

oOoOoOoOo

Kingsley drummed his fingers on the desk and listened to his cabinet bicker.

His cabinet was smaller than usual. Two members were dead and one was missing. He would either turn up in the hospital, or not turn up at all, meaning his body was still in the Ministry, not able to be recovered for at least six months while the poisons filtered through the building.

Because his cabinet had been halved, Kingsley had invited some members of the Wizengamot to sit in. He didn't know if it had been a mistake or if everyone was past the point of talking rationally. They were bickering like school children, snapping back and forth, and frankly, it was getting irritating.

The door opened quietly and a familiar figure slipped into the room. Kingsley was used to Percy's unobtrusive entrances. Percy seemed to make it his personal challenge to be as unnoticeable as possible, but today Kingsley started and stared. Today, the entire room turned around and took notice of Percy Weasley.

"The hero of the hour!" Judge Whitcomb proclaimed loudly.

"Huzzah!" Finn Trembley called, pumping his fist in the air.

"Well-done, Assistant!" Georgia Hallback said.

Even Florence Greene and Gregor Ives stopped their bickering to applaud.

Percy was visibly startled. He tried to take a step back, but Judge Whitcomb reached out and pulled Percy into the center of the room, vigorously shaking his hand. And that was cue for the other officials to offer their praise and accolades as well, and Kingsley sat back and watched because…

Because Percy didn't look like his usual self. His face was pale. His eyes were squinted in the corners, like he was in pain. He was moving carefully, gingerly. His hands had the slightest of tremors running throughout them.

Percy didn't look as terrible as Kingsley expected him to look – one day after being tortured by Voldemort, but Kingsley had other ways of checking in on Percy's well-being. He waited for the hubbub to die down, and then asked, "Percy, what's your opinion on short-term travel restrictions?"

Percy blinked once, obviously trying to extrapolate what the issue was based on Kingsley's question. That was one of the greatest skills Percy had, extrapolating information from the most meager of sources. But instead of chiming in with an opinion, Percy blinked once more in confusion.

Kingsley frowned. Percy was not well.

The bickering started up again, Florence Greene debating that loved ones needed to see their family members who were injured and Gregor Ives shouting out that security was the most important, and that meant travel restrictions and a curfew.

Percy cleared his throat, cutting through the debate. "The average moderate injury treated in a wizarding hospital takes twenty-four hours. Most hospitals are being faced with over-crowding, but even tacking on extra treatment time, those citizens with moderate injuries will start being sent home this afternoon. It wouldn't make sense to lift the restriction now, not when most of the injured should be sent home in a few hours."

Kingsley nodded, feeling some measure of relief that Percy was still himself, just a little slower on the uptake. Not surprising, all things considered.

"We'll lift the travel ban this evening then," he decided. Ives started arguing, his same old tune of security, but Kingsley raised his hand, cutting him off. "People need to be with their loved ones, and Percy's right. Most of those with minor injuries will be home by then, so the number of those traveling will be cut down."

He waited for any more arguments, but none came.

"There is the matter of the casualty list," said Trembley.

"Take a break," said Kingsley. "It's just about lunch time."

There were a few pauses, a few hesitations, but then the members filtered out the door. Percy remained behind, sitting in one of the chairs in front of Kingsley's desk.

"I can't help but notice that the papers say nothing of Voldemort's presence at the Ministry," he began.

"I can't help but notice that you're here when the Healers said you needed another week," Kingsley countered.

"I got bored," said Percy.

"You were blinded," Kingsley said, bluntly. Percy had signed release of medical information to Kingsley. Kingsley had received the news just after Percy had been informed.

He saw Percy flinch. He watched his fingers rise to the new glasses on his face.

"It's okay to take time," Kingsley said. "I'll send you to the coast, if you want. Hell, I'll send your whole family. How about it? Take a week off. Heal up. Adjust."

"Hardly the time for a vacation," said Percy, looking back up. "And I've always found work to be therapeutic."

"You look like you're going to keel over," Kingsley said. "Has Healer James cleared you?"

Percy winced a little. "Not precisely."

"Have James look you over. If he clears you, fine. But otherwise, you're out of a job until he says, understand?"

Percy nodded.

"Did you tell your folks?" Kingsley asked. "I'm sure they're worried about you."

"I'm sure they read the article," said Percy, somewhat curtly.

Kingsley raised an eyebrow. Percy rarely got snippy. He watched Percy close his eyes for a brief second and take in a breath. "I'll send an owl later."

Kingsley knew it was a lie. He didn't comment, just started shuffling the papers to clear a spot on his desk. "We've decided not to reveal that Voldemort was on scene at the Ministry and specifically targeting Ministry officials."

"Because it would incite greater panic," said Percy.

"And because it means we have a mole," said Kingsley.

Percy looked up, startled. "What's our next move?"

"Your next move is to visit Healer James," said Kingsley. "And if he clears you for work, you can do something boring. Like take a nap."

Percy frowned at him. "I am the Assistant Minister," he said.

Kingsley sighed and sat back in the chair. "There are insurance policies need to be looked at and sorted."

The amount of paperwork for the insurance claims was terrifying. Percy, however, smiled a little, like he was comforted at the thought. "I can do insurance."

oOoOoOoOo

Fred and George sat side-by-side together. George leaned in a little towards Fred, their shoulders brushing, because Fred had been injured and George needed the reassurance.

Charlie had been the best sport about all the jokes that Fred and George played. Bill had been a little too old to find it funny. Percy had always been too serious and irritated. Ron was too whiney, and Ginny could get vicious with revenge.

Charlie though –

Charlie always found it funny, even when the jokes were at his expense. And he actually helped them improve their jokes and their inventions.

And now Charlie was dead.

"Not fair," said Fred.

"Not fair," echoed George.

"Not Charlie," said Fred.

"Not Charlie," agreed George.

"Bill," said Fred, because if it wasn't fair that it was Charlie, then who would be fair?

"Fleur," reminded George.

The twins nodded. It wouldn't have been fair if Bill had died.

"Ginny," offered George.

"Malfoy," said Fred.

"Hmm," they said together, because Malfoy was a threat to be reckoned with, that is, if he ever came back.

"And… Ginny," they said together. Their little sister. Their only sister. No, not Ginny either.

"Ron?" asked George.

"Poor Ron," said Fred.

"Rough deal," agreed George. Ron was a bit of a pathetic creature. Best friends with Harry and Hermione, who were dating each other. Born with a good brain, but not a lot of common sense.

"Bit too pathetic," said Fred.

George sighed his agreement. Not Ron either.

"Percy," suggested Fred.

"Percy," pondered George.

Percy. Percy, two years older than them, constantly serious, constantly complaining, constantly judging. Percy who started arguments. Percy who was ashamed of being a Weasley. Percy who was arrogant and snobbish and insecure all at once.

"Percy," they said together.

It would have been fairer if it had been Percy.

oOoOoOoOo

Kingsley was tired. It was just coming up on dinnertime, but it felt like midnight.

He knew that was because he hadn't slept the night before. How could he sleep? The Ministry had fallen. Good witches and wizards had died. The people closest to him – John Kelly, Flora Chaucer, Gregor Lee, Licester Jones. Even more were injured.

And Percy had been in the hospital recovering from severe injuries with potential brain damage.

Kingsley had stayed at the office in Greenfriar, keeping the midnight watch over England. And he was paying for it now. He rested his elbows on his desk and rubbed his eyes. "Is that it?" he asked, trying not to sound too hopeful.

"For now, yes," said Daphne Sturgess. She was the second assistant, more of a secretary, really, but she filled in when Percy was indisposed (caught up in some other Ministry business), out of country (on Ministry business), sick (rarely), or took vacation (ha! like Percy had ever taken vacation).

"Good," Kingsley said.

"Most of the cabinet have already turned in for the night," Daphne said. "Your room is ready for you, whenever you decide to turn in, and the kitchen is open. Shall I send in dinner?"

Dinner sounded perfect. Kingsley let out a mighty yawn, stretched, and said, "Yes. If you-,"

There was a brief knock on the door and then Deanna, the secretary, stuck her head in. "Don't get too alarmed, sir," she said in opening.

Kingsley immediately felt his shoulders tense. He forced them to relax. "Yes?"

"Assistant Minister Weasley had a bit of a fainting spell," Deanna said. "Healer James is with him now."

Kingsley got up and strode for the door. "Where?"

"His office," said Deanna, holding the door open for him.

Kingsley turned to the left outside his office and walked down the short hall to Percy's office. It had once been a drawing room and Percy was currently reclining on what once had been a brocade armchair, but was now transfigured into a lounge of sorts. Several pillows were propped up behind him and a thick blanket was pulled over his legs. Healer James was sitting beside him, taking his pulse. James didn't look too concerned, and Percy flushed a little when Kingsley walked in. He was embarrassed. That was a heartening sign. If he was embarrassed, then it wasn't anything serious.

"Over did it?" Kingsley asked.

It was obvious that was the problem. Percy was still pale, and the circles beneath his eyes had deepened. He gave a wan smile. "Just slightly."

"He'll stay right here for the night," said Healer James, releasing Percy's wrist. "No work, just rest, a good meal, and a good night's sleep."

Percy glanced at the coffee table. An entire apothecary of medicinal herbs and potions was set up on the surface.

"Ah, and those, of course," said James.

Percy huffed a little, annoyed. James shot him a look. "Maybe next time you'll believe me when I say you need a week of rest, huh?"

"Hardly," said Kingsley, answering for Percy, but he stepped further into the room and pulled over the other brocade armchair. "I was just about to order up some dinner myself. I'll keep you company."

Percy sighed, but some tension seemed to bleed out of him. Kingsley could imagine the prospect of being alone right now, still trying to avoid the trauma that had been inflicted on him, was not restful.

"Soup for you," James told Percy. "And once we get some food into your system, we can start with the potions."

Percy looked decidedly apprehensive.

OoOoOoOoO

Ginny stared blankly at the vanity mirror. She just finished a shower, she was wrapped up in a fuzzy robe, and she just didn't have it in her to comb through her wet hair or put any make-up on.

Charlie was dead.

Charlie was dead.

Charlie – the emotional anchor for the family – was gone. The Weasleys were prone to temper – everyone knew that. Charlie though – Charlie was always quicker with a laugh than an angry word. He was the one that always defused the fighting in the house, he was the one that could step in and douse the flames – just like he could calm a dragon. And now he was gone.

Ginny put her elbows down on the vanity top and put her head in her hands. Her heart hurt. Her chest felt tight.

She blindly reached out and snagged the letter that was tucked into the corner of the mirror. She resisted the urge to squeeze it, wanting to hold on tight but not wanting to crease the pages. Draco's letter to her. He said he should have been back by now.

"Where are you?" Ginny whispered, her voice catching on the words. "I need you right now."

She tried to ignore the thought in her head that said maybe Draco was dead too.

She tried to ignore it, but the voice just got louder.

She sobbed.

OoOoOoOoO

Percy woke to blackness and – for one second – he panicked and his hands went to his face, sure there must be something blindfolding him. And then he remembered that he was blind. And this darkness was his life now.

Percy sucked in a quick breath and let it out slowly. If this was his life now, then surely he could grow used to it. So he looked around at nothing, his eyes blinking rapidly, still trying vainly to clear his vision. He took in another breath and forced himself to acclimatize to the black, to the emptiness. He'd never really been scared of the dark before. This shouldn't be a problem for him.

He pushed himself up a little bit. A pillow slipped out from behind him and toppled to the floor. Percy reached out gingerly, trying to feel for the pillow, but all he felt was empty air. He reached down further, and further, and further. His heart skipped a beat. Where was the floor? Surely he was reaching down too far. Shouldn't his fingers be touching the carpet by now?

Why couldn't he feel the floor?

He had the sudden feeling that the floor was no longer there, and he was about to tip off the bed and fall into nothing. He grabbed onto the bed with one hand and desperately groped for his glasses with the other. He'd taken them off. He'd put them right on the side table.

His fingers hit the table. He fumbled for the glasses, seized, them and hurriedly pulled them on just as the door was flung open. Healer James rushed in.

"Are you okay?"

Percy didn't feel okay. And he was sure that his heartbeat was skyrocketing and that had alerted the Healer. He pulled in a breath. "Just… adjusting," he said, somewhat lamely.

The Healer crossed over, performed a few vital-monitoring charms, and frowned. "How do you feel about a fortnight in a spa somewhere out of the country? Because if your blood pressure doesn't go down, I'm going to order you there."

Percy sighed and snagged the pillow from the floor. "Just give me a potion, James."

"The country will run without you," James said.

"Right into a brick wall," Percy retorted. He wasn't leaving.

James sighed. "I'll give you a few potions, but you're not cleared to work until you've had breakfast. And a bath. Not a shower, an actual bath. This manor has quite the decadent bathing facilities and you will use them."

"You drive a hard bargain, Healer James," said Percy.

"I'll send for your breakfast," said James.

He left the room and Percy sank back onto the pillows, silently cursing himself for being such a wimp. If only his brothers could see him now, freaking out about a dropped pillow, they'd laugh their arses off.

oOoOoOoO

Bill sat beside Charlie's bed. Charlie's body lay on the bed, still and silent, like he was sleeping.

Actually, not like he was sleeping. Charlie was a sprawler, or rather, had been a sprawler. He would end up half on the floor some nights. This still, straight body wasn't Charlie.

Bill felt a hand on his shoulder. He grabbed it, immediately knowing it was Fleur. He felt her fingers tighten, squeezing, offering comfort.

Bill bent forward, put his head in his hands, and felt hot, heavy tears stream down his face.

oOoOoOoO

Kingsley dropped the paper down on his desk. He put his head in his hands. "Shit."

"I thought you'd want to know," said Daphne.

"Has this been made public?"

She shook her head. "The official casualty list is still being compiled. It won't be released until we're sure that the families were notified first. Most likely two or three days now."

Kingsley rubbed his head. "How many people know about this?"

"Not many."

"Keep it that way," said Kingsley. "And get me James."

Daphne nodded and left the office. Kingsley rubbed his forehead and glanced down at the paper again. Shit.

Healer James knocked lightly on the open door and Kingsley looked up and waved him in. James shut the door and then took the seat in front of the desk.

"How is he?" Kingsley asked.

There was no need to clarify who 'he' was.

"Eating breakfast," said James, being deliberately obtuse.

Kingsley raised his eyebrows. James heaved an angry sigh and dropped into the chair in front of his desk.

"How do you think, Kingsley? He was tortured to the extent of having brain damage, consequentially lost his sight, and now he's back at work without taking any time to grieve or rage or curl up in a ball and cry. He's a wreck."

Kingsley was a little taken aback. "A wreck?"

James sighed again, a little less hostilely this time. "A very neat and tidy wreck," he allowed. "But he needs time, Kingsley. I'd like it if he wasn't at work at all, but I can't convince him to leave."

"He's just handling insurance forms," said Kingsley.

"Good," said James. "Give him all the time he needs to catalogue lost objects and fill out forms."

Kingsley steepled his fingers. "How well do you think he could handle a shock right now?"

James recoiled. "Shock? What? No – no shock, Kingsley. Not even a surprise." James frowned. "Why?"

Kingsley slid the piece of paper over the desk. "That's an updated list of casualties. It won't be made public for the time being. His brother, Charlie, is on the list."

James let out a breath. "Shit."

"Should I tell him?"

James shook his head. "No. Not yet. Not unless you want him back in the hospital."

"I have to tell him sometime," Kingsley said.

"Get his family to come in, or a close friend, to break the news to him. But not today, Kingsley. For Merlin's sake, he should still be in the hospital."

Kingsley tried not to feel the relief that followed, and then the guilt. "I'll owl his parents. See if they can come in."

James nodded. "Good."

oOoOoO

Author's note: Well, that took a while, didn't it? Real life threw a bit of loop at me. I think I updated my profile to reflect that there'd been a bit of a family crisis, and then it resolved, and then there was a crisis again. Because it was so much fun the first time around. But it's all good now.

Also - Percy is taking up a bit too much of my time. I got one more chapter of him left (which will be up next week, promise! because it's written, it just needs editing, and then we'll go back to Draco.) Sorry for the detour!





11. The Aftermath: Part II

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. Alas.

Author's Note: Next chapter returns to Draco. I'm thinking I'll need two weeks as I have to re-orient myself to the actual plot of this book, lol.

OoOoOoOoO

One year ago…

"You'll have to give a statement," Gleason said.

Percy looked at all of the magazines and articles that littered the coffee table. 'Hero of England, Assistant Minister Weasley' read the Daily Prophet, 'Brave and Courageous Assistant Minister Saves England' said the Magical Times, 'Percy Weasley – Britain's Unsung Hero' proclaimed the Wizarding Weekly.

Percy looked back up at Gleason. "What the hell did you do?"

Gleason shrugged. "This wasn't me, Weasley. Your story is just that compelling. And here, look at this one, the ladies are loving you."

He tossed Percy a women's magazine. Percy looked at the photo on front. It was a photo of him – not that this was a new development, all of the newspapers had photos of him – but this type of photo was new. All the other newspapers had used official photos of him, his stern portrait in front of the flag, his somber picture when he had been sworn into office, and so forth. All of them had captured Percy looking serious and grave.

This photo, however, was a candid shot. Percy had to think back to recall the event. It had been right after a long and trying news conference. The news had been good for a change. They'd received a pledge of assistance from the States. The official Ministry photographer had followed Kingsley and the others back to the Minister's office to take a few 'behind the scene' photos.

Percy was rarely the focus of the photographers, but this time the camera had focused on him. He was sitting in one of the chairs in front of Kingsley's desk. His dress robes were draped over the arm of the chair, leaving him in dress trousers and a plain Oxford, open at the throat. The picture captured him in the act of pulling off his glasses, glancing out of frame, and then laughing, ever-so-slightly, at something unseen. If Percy remembered correctly, John Kelley had just cracked a joke.

It was a very flattering photo of him, which made Percy stare at it for a moment. He usually looked pinched or upset in photos. 'Constipated' was the way Fred and George always described it. In this photo though… he almost looked like Bill. Almost. Bill was easily the best-looking of the Weasley boys, and Percy couldn't really hope to surpass his brother in that regard.

He glanced at the headline above the photo. "Assistant Minister Percy Weasley: Smart, Brave, and Sexy." The tagline read, "Learn about the handsome hero who saved the Ministry of Magic – and he's single!"

Percy felt something like panic seize him. He looked up at Gleason. "What the hell is this? Sexy? Single?"

Gleason raised his hands, acting innocent, but also looking like he was having a blast at Percy's discomfort. "Hey, I did not print that, but wow, is it doing wonders for your popularity. Everyone is clamoring for an interview, and I mean, everyone. Even a bunch of foreign media sites are interested."

"Shit," Percy said, feeling something like dread wash over him.

Gleason laughed, just a little. "Look, Weasley, we need to think about catering to the media. I can see it going one of two ways. One, we do it press conference style. You give a statement, take a bunch of questions, and it'll be over in thirty minutes. The downside is it'll be more chaotic and it will be harder to control the questions that are asked and the narrative that comes out. Option number two, we sit you down for a one on one interview. That will be longer, about an hour, but we can pre-screen the questions and guide the story. What do you think?"

For as much as Percy disliked Gleason, there were times like this when he remembered just how good Gleason was at his job. He sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose underneath his glasses. "There are more important people to interview."

"I've got other heroes on a press conference tomorrow," said Gleason. "Rudy Costace and George Parrish will be there answering questions about how they evacuated the Ministry. Laurel Heddy, from Sports, will talk about how she evacuated her whole floor safely, and Carlo Santiago, intern for Muggle Affairs, will talk about he wrestled a hippogriff."

"Put me in with them," said Percy. "Let's not give too much attention to this story. It's ridiculous enough already."

Gleason shook his head. "That won't be enough."

"We'll think about a one-on-one later," said Percy. "But I'm not about to steal the spotlight from anyone else who risked their life to save the Ministry. Put me in with them. And I want to approve the reporters who will be in attendance."

"You always do," said Gleason.

oOoOoOoOoOo

Arthur Weasley considered the letter in front of him. It came from a regal looking eagle-owl, bearing the crest that marked it as an official Ministry owl. The owl was waiting now, perched still and patient on the table, as Arthur tried to come up with an appropriate reply. He struggled for words, so he read the letter again.

'Arthur and Molly,

I am deeply saddened and grieved to hear of Charlie's death. Charlie was a brave man, a good man, and I know his absence will be felt dearly.

Not only is this letter to wish you the deepest of condolences, but also to let you know that Percy is doing well. I know there have been reports of his injuries. Rest assured, he is recovering well and is, as usual, trying to do too much too soon. We are making sure he gets his rest.

I do hope you are proud of your son – both your sons – and if I might request a favor, could you please consider coming to the Ministry and seeing Percy? I'm sure that being with his parents during this time would be a great comfort to him.

Please write back when it is convenient for you to travel here, and I will see to it that the proper arrangements are made.

My heartfelt sympathies,

Kingsley Shacklebolt

Arthur put the letter down. He picked up the newspaper beside it, one of many that talked about how Percy had single-handedly saved England.

The newspaper stated that after seeing the Minister to safety, Percy had activated the self-destruct on the Ministry building, preventing Voldemort from gaining control. But that report did not match what Arthur knew to be true.

After Kingsley had been evacuated, there had been hours of conflict. Hundreds of civilians, Aurors, Civis Arma troops, and Order members had died. And no one had even seen Percy. And Charlie, convinced that Percy was in danger, had died trying to save him.

So where had Percy been during those hours? Why hadn't he activated the self-destruct sooner?

And the newspaper said Percy was seriously injured in the attempt. But now Kingsley was reporting that he was back at work already.

Arthur felt grief and anger well in his chest. He was burying Charlie tomorrow. He was trying to console his family, comfort his wife, and plan a funeral, and now Kingsley wanted him to visit Percy to… what, exactly? Hold his hand while his scrapes were tended to?

Arthur picked up his pen and formulated a quick response.

Dear Kingsley,

Thank you for your sympathies. Charlie's death is a great tragedy to this family.

I have already owled Percy concerning his brother's death and funeral arrangements. We had hoped he would come home. His mother is requesting that the family retire to the Burrow and spend time together. We assumed that, due to his lack of response, he was not inclined to attend. I am, of course, grateful to hear he is recovered from any injuries he might have sustained.

Charlie's service is tomorrow, 2pm. You are most welcome to come as well, although I recognize that might be difficult for you in your position. Surely you could spare Percy for attendance.

Yours,

Arthur

oOoOoOoOo

"What is that?" Percy demanded.

It was morning, early morning. Too early, in Percy's opinion, but with the press conference taking up most of the afternoon, he needed to get some actual work done. He hadn't been expecting Deanna to levitate an entire box of parchment onto his desk.

"Mail for you," Deanna said.

Percy looked inside at the hundreds and hundreds of letters that were inside. "But… I was only gone from my apartment for a few days. I was only expecting a water bill."

"Let me specify," said Deanna. "This is fan mail. If your water bill is in it, we're going to have to do some digging."

Percy felt something twinge in his temples. "I don't have time for this," he said faintly.

"This isn't even all of it," said Deanna. "This is just what security cleared, so if you have any urgent correspondences… well, let's hope that water bill isn't due soon, huh?"

"There has to be a better way," said Percy.

Deanna shrugged. "All of the Ministry mail is going to be delayed for the next few weeks. Not only is there more of it, but security needs to make sure nothing's been sabotaged."

"We're going to have urgent correspondences that can't wait a few weeks," Percy said. "What can we do to quicken the process?"

"Our correspondence secretaries who filter through the mail are either stuck in London, injured in a hospital, or dead," said Deanna, rather bluntly.

Percy felt the same twinge in his head. He rubbed at his temples. "Right. Okay. Let's send out a call to the local temp agencies and put a job posting in the paper. We're the Ministry of Magic. We need to be able to answer our mail on time. Have Lindsay interview any potential candidates. Make sure they appear capable of learning on the job."

Deanna nodded. "And what about this box?"

Percy sighed and motioned over to the corner. "Somewhere over there."

She did as instructed. Percy let out a breath and tried to re-focus on the insurance forms that were stacked in pillars around him. A knock on the door interrupted him. Percy looked up and tried not to scowl. "Gleason."

"Read it and rejoice," Gleason said, plopping a newspaper down on his desk, sending a couple loose pages fluttering to the floor.

Percy glanced at the headline. "Interview with the Heroes of the Ministry This Afternoon.' The subheading read, 'Learn all about the harrowing details of the battle at the Ministry. Tune into the live broadcast'.

"Live broadcast?" Percy demanded, because he did not agree to that.

"Hey, once the radio stations learned that you were going to be attending, I've been receiving requests to air it non-stop. It's going to be a larger audience than the Quidditch World Cup."

The twinge in his temples sharpened. Percy sucked in a breath and massaged his temples, trying to ease it away. "You can't just spring this on me."

"What's been sprung on you?" Kingsley demanded, entering in the room. There was something sharp in his tone that had Percy glancing up, confused.

"Radio," said Gleason. "The press conference is going to be on the radio."

Some of the tension eased out of Kingsley, but he still frowned at Gleason. "Get a list of pre-approved questions out there."

"Pre-approved questions!" Gleason whined.

"Or Percy gets pulled," said Kingsley. "For Merlin's sake, Gleason, are you trying to send him back to the hospital?"

Gleason whined a little bit more, but then grudgingly moved off. Percy shot Kingsley a look. "I'm not going to faint again."

Kingsley grabbed a chair. "I think it's too much for you right now."

Percy shrugged. "Gleason knows what he's doing. It's useful to show a strong government to the people right now. And if that means sitting through a press conference, then I can do that."

"It's not just a press conference," said Kingsley.

Percy frowned. "What?"

"The Wizengamot rushed through the applications for several honors for those at the conference, you included. You'll be receiving a medal for your efforts in the battle."

Percy blinked for a moment. Something warm and vain bolstered in his chest, the way it always did when he got recognition for a job well done. It was followed immediately by a plummet of guilt. Why was he getting an award when others had died?

And then something dark twisted in his thoughts. A medal? He'd lost his vision, and he was getting a medal? As if that made it all better?

The sharpness in his temples became a bolt shooting through his brain. He dropped his head forward on his hands.

"Whoa, you okay, Percy?"

"Migraine," said Percy. He was used to migraines. Everyone knew he had migraines. He wanted it to be a migraine and not something else. Side effects of the glasses.

Kingsley dropped a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. "Take it easy until this afternoon. Lie down for a bit. I'll have Healer James come up with some pain relievers."

Percy let out a breath. Pain relievers sounded perfect.

oOoOoOoOo

Bill paused for a moment, not quite sure he'd heard that right, and then reached out and turned up the radio.

"-his first interview since the attack at the Ministry," radio announcer Gladys Temple was saying. "The hero who saved the Ministry from falling into the wrong hands, Assistant Minister Percy Weasley."

"And that's not all," said Mike Patrick. "There are rumors that he'll also receive recognition from the Ministry for his actions, perhaps the Medal of Arthur, which awards valor and service to the nation."

"If anyone deserves it, it's the Assistant Minister," said Gladys. "And he'll be joined on stage by three other heroes of the battle, so remember, tune in for the ceremony. It will be starting today at 1:30."

Arthur reached by him and smacked the radio off. Stunned silence filled the kitchen. Bill glanced around at the family gathered.

"He'll be here," said Ginny, crossing her arms. "He won't choose an award over Charlie's funeral."

"He let Charlie die," Fred said.

"Oh, bollocks," Ginny retorted.

"You weren't there," George said, speaking up in defense of his twin. "We were trying to get down to the seventh floor. We were fighting Death Eaters because we were told that Percy was down there. We didn't see him."

"The Ministry is huge," Ginny argued back. "That means nothing."

"We swept the Ministry," said Ron. He looked up from his cup of tea. "We swept the Ministry, Ginny. We didn't see him."

"He was hiding," said Fred.

"Is that so bad?" Ginny asked. "He was trying to get to the self-destruct, and he was all alone, and maybe that was the best he could do."

"Hiding while Charlie died for him?" George asked. "Is that really the best he could do?"

"You don't know the full story," Ginny said, her eyes flashing defiance. "Until we hear it from Percy's mouth, we are not going to accuse him of anything other than doing his job."

"Oh, we're going to hear it," said Ron. "At 1:30 pm. When he gives an interview and gets a medal while Charlie gets buried."

Molly burst into tears and ran out of the room. Arthur followed her. Ginny glared at her brothers. Bill watched the glares get returned. And then he noticed Pansy, in the corner of the room, something hard and scary entering her eyes.

oOoOoOoOo

The interview was being held at the War Memorial Building. Rather fitting, Percy thought, all things considered.

He and Kingsley arrived early because there were plenty of matters to be dealt – and plenty of officials to meet with. The War Memorial was the closest building to the Ministry with extra space, and so it was already becoming a secondary Ministry site for the minor offices – the Department of Sports and Magical Animals and the like.

It was also commonly used for state funerals, and when Percy and Kingsley walked by the back hall, there was a funeral in progress. Percy recognized the portrait displayed outside of the closed doors. Violetta Gabny.

He paused and stared.

"She was found dead in her home after the Ministry fell," Kingsley told him. "The Violetta we saw that morning was an imposter."

There was an attendant at the doors. "The service just started, Minister," she said.

Percy looked over at Kingsley, and together they stepped towards the door. The attendant swung it open, and they slipped unobtrusively inside, followed by the more distracting contingent of Aurors tasked with following the Minister.

oOoOoOoOoOo

The clock drew closer to two pm. Bill couldn't help but watch the clock while he listened to the radio. He'd thought at first that Percy was going to be interviewed right at one-thirty. He'd thought that Percy would say a few words and then he'd come straight to the Burrow for the funeral.

But it was quickly becoming obvious that the ceremony was deliberately saving Percy for last. Bill watched out the window as the lawn filled up – relatives and neighbors and Order members all piling underneath the black tent that took up the entire front lawn. Bill remembered getting married there. The tent had been white then.

Bill had already listened to a few opening speeches. And then he had listened to a few awards given out. Laurel Heddy and Carlo Santiago both received the Medal of Arthur – civilian recognitions for their service to the country. George Parrish and Rudy Costace both received the Golden Shield.

Bill glanced at the clock now. It was minutes away from 2pm. The kitchen door opened and Arthur stepped in. "You coming?" he asked.

Over the radio, the Chief of Aurors was speaking. "And now, I ask that the Assistant Minister, Percy Weasley, join me on the stage."

The applause from the audience was thunderous. The radio announcer, Gladys Temple, had to pitch her voice louder to be heard over the applause. "The Assistant Minister is walking out now. You can hear by the cheers that he is the one everyone is excited for. His story and bravery have captivated the nation. He's shaking hands with the Chief Auror now."

Arthur stepped closer. Both he and Bill bent over the radio.

"Assistant Minister Percy Weasley," said the Chief Auror. "It is my great honor to grant to you the Staff of Merlin!"

The radio crackled with the cheers from the audience. Bill looked up at his father and they both stared, incredulous. The Staff of Merlin was the most prestige award in the nation.

And Percy had gotten it?

"Astounding!" Gladys Temple exclaimed into her microphone. "The Staff of Merlin hasn't been awarded in a century. It's reserved for the highest of honors, and it is clear that England agrees with this decision. The entire audience is on their feet. I can see the Assistant Minister looking rather stunned, it appears he did not know about this honor. He's shaking hands again with the Chief Auror, and now with the other honorees on stage. Official reports said he was seriously injured in the attack, but it is clear he recovered well. There are no visible injuries.

"And just listen to that crowd! Still standing. Still applauding. We'll have to wait until the end of the conference to hear what the Assistant has to say as he is scheduled last in the line up. We expect we will hear him around three o'clock, if everything stays on schedule. Now-,"

Arthur flicked the radio off. "Come," he said. "The funeral is starting."

OoOoOoOoO

Percy waited in the wings as Rudy and George finished up their interview. A make-up witch flitted about him, dabbing a little bit of potion to his face to make him less pale.

"Two minutes," an assistant told him.

The make-up witch dabbed one last spot on his face and then gently ran a soft cloth over the medal pinned to his chest. The Staff of Merlin.

Percy still couldn't believe it had been awarded to him. The highest honor for bravery and service to England. Percy was only the twelfth person to receive the medal. He'd been so shocked, so surprised, that he hadn't heard what the chief of Aurors had whispered in his ear as he pinned it to his robes. He'd been afraid his knees would give out from standing so long as the audience kept clapping and cheering.

Percy had only been expecting the medal of Arthur – like the other two civilians had received. He had no idea…

It was going on four o'clock now. The interviews and speeches were running over, and Percy was scheduled last. The others were on stage. Carlo and Laurel had taken seats on stage, their portion of the interview already over. Rudy and George were at the podium now, feeding off of each other as they talked about their ordeal during the battle. Rudy was the funny one, and George was the straight man. They could have been a comedy duo. They were half the reason it was going so long.

The moderator finally had them step back to join the other seated guests, and then Percy was called back onto stage.

Percy sucked in a breath and then stepped out onto the stage. The applause was less intense now. Maybe the audience was getting tired after two hours of pageantry. Maybe their hands hurt from clapping so hard for everyone else.

Percy crossed the stage, shook hands with the moderator, and then took his spot at the podium. He pulled the note cards from his robe pocket and carefully arranged them. He was supposed to start with his statement. Percy looked out at the audience and began his carefully planned words.

oOoOoOoOo

The radio was on.

Percy's voice was talking.

Molly wanted to listen, she truly did. Arthur had said that Percy had been given the Staff of Merlin, and part of Molly understood why Percy had missed Charlie's funeral. That award was so important, and so grand, it would be a hard thing to say 'no' to. Especially for Percy. Percy always loved winning awards.

Molly knew it was his way of trying to stand out from his brothers. She knew he was desperate for attention and validation, and she genuinely tried hard to give it to him. She tried to give all of her children equal time and energy, but the others tended to be so loud, and Percy so quiet, that sometimes he did get neglected.

And then when Molly tried to make-up for that lapse, tried to shower him with praise and affection, it seemed to only make things worse. It came off insincere, and the other boys, picking up on the extreme, thought it was something of a joke and teased him for the attention.

So Molly understood why he hadn't come, but she also wondered why he couldn't have just postponed the ceremony. Percy was always talking about his position in the government, and all the responsibilities he had. Surely he could have moved the press conference. Surely he could have at least asked his parents to delay Charlie's funeral. Arthur would have been furious to be sure, but Molly would have done it. If Percy had been that brave, if he truly deserved the Staff of Merlin, then he should have the opportunity to be recognized for it.

Molly wasn't quite sure what Percy had done, apart from setting the self-destruct on the Ministry, but it must be important if he was getting the Staff of Merlin. She tried to pay attention to Percy talking on the radio, tried to understand what he had done, but it was hard. Her mind kept wandering to Charlie. To his casket. To the hole in the ground.

There was applause on the radio, jerking her from her thoughts.

"And now the Assistant Minister will take questions from the audience," Gladys Temple announced.

oOoOoOoOo

Percy took a sip of water as the first reporter spoke up.

"Assistant Minister, can you describe what was your greatest obstacle in getting to the self-destruct?"

The questions had all been submitted to Percy and Gleason before the conference. Percy started his answer with a little pre-planned joke. "You mean apart from convincing the Minister to actually evacuate the Ministry and not don his old Auror robe to fight the Death Eaters?"

He paused for the laughter, not raucous laughter, but the polite chuckle of an audience eager for levity in dark times. He waited a few beats, and then continued. "Honestly, I had a lot of help from Auror Rudy Costace, who is here along with me today, his actions being appropriately honored."

Percy paused again, for applause this time, and even joined in.

Rudy took that as his cue to jump up and join Percy at the microphone. "I got taken out halfway through, but I assure you, that not even Potter himself could have fought the horde of Death Eaters I was up against."

More laughter, louder this time. Rudy was far better with the jokes. The Auror gave a jaunty little wave and then reclaimed his seat.

"After Auror Costace was injured," Percy continued, "I had to make my way to the self-destruct alone. Thankfully, being Assistant Minister means I know a lot of back passageways and shortcuts. Even most Ministry employees weren't aware of the route I was taking, much less the attacking forces. The hardest part was probably staying out of sight. I'm not the strongest dueler, so I really focused on stealth over brute force."

"Stealth?" asked a voice. An alarmingly familiar voice.

Percy frowned and glanced out over the auditorium. He spotted Gladwell Avery tucked into a side row. He was standing, his wand projecting his voice over the entire audience.

"Mr. Avery," said Percy, "I wasn't aware security was letting you in these days."

In fact, security was not supposed to let Avery in at all. The reporter was notorious for inflammatory pieces and general mayhem. That was the reason he had been barred from Ministry press conferences.

"You can't keep the truth of being reported, Assistant," said Avery.

"And you can't seem to stick to the truth," Percy responded back, keeping his voice neutral but stern.

"Let's have the truth then," Avery challenged. "By stealth, you mean you were hiding, weren't you?"

Percy could see several Aurors walking down the aisle, ready to remove the reporter, but Percy knew that would just cause a greater commotion. And then the public would start to wonder why reporters were being removed from the conference. They would start to wonder if Percy had something to hide. He leaned in to the microphone. "There is no need to remove Mr. Avery at this time."

The Aurors paused. There was a palpable tension in the room. Percy gave a bland sort of smile, one that said he wasn't troubled in the least by Avery's accusation. "I will answer your question, Mr. Avery; however, I daresay you will have to answer to the Aurors before you leave. Yes. There were times when I hid from the Death Eaters. If I felt that I could not defeat the forces at hand, I tried to avoid them, and if I could not avoid them, I hid from them, all while making my way down to the self-destruct trigger."

"It was obviously the better move," Rudy called out from the stage. "Seeing as I ended up unconscious after trying to force my way through."

There were a few laughs and a few murmurs from the audience.

Percy appreciated the backup from the Auror. He looked back at Avery. "Is that all?"

"Hardly," said Avery. "I understand you attended the funeral of Ms. Violetta Gabny this afternoon. Why did you attend Ms. Gabny's funeral and not other Ministry employees?"

Percy resisted the urge to sigh because of course a gesture of respect was now going to be taken out of context. Instead, he answered clearly and precisely. "The Minister and I arrived early for the news conference today. We saw that the funeral had just begun. As Ms. Gabny was a good friend of myself and the Minister, it seemed only appropriate that we stop in to pay our respects. Obviously, we cannot attend every funeral, although if it were possible, I would attend every funeral, and I believe the Minister would do the same."

"And what about your brother's funeral?" Avery asked. "Was it not possible for you to attend his service today?"

Percy paused. What?

What funeral?

Being a politician meant Percy never revealed when he was caught off guard. He never admitted to not knowing what the hell someone else was talking about.

He paused now, and glanced to the others on stage, hoping for some sign. He saw Rudy stiffen.

Percy extrapolated from that piece of information. Rudy was a liaison to the Order. He would know if the Order had suffered causalities. He would know if one of Percy's brothers was dead.

Rudy's body language told him that Avery's accusation was correct. One of his brothers was dead.

The world seemed to spin underneath him. The earth was re-setting on a new axis. One of his brothers was dead.

There were faint murmurs in the audience. Percy was taking too long to answer. The audience was wondering if the Assistant Minister had skipped his brother's funeral to attend an award's ceremony – hardly the message of valor and honor that the Ministry was trying to convey.

Percy had a job to do. He turned back to Avery. The reporter was waiting, a smug smile on his lips.

Percy opened his mouth and began to speak, feeling oddly removed from his body. It felt like he was listening to himself speak from across the room.

"At this time, I am not ready to discuss my personal life. The purpose of this conference was to honor the brave men and women who risked their lives in the battle, and I am very humbled to be a part of this interview. I recognize that my story pales in comparison to the others on stage today."

He paused, licked his lips, and continued. "I believe that, as a country, we need to hear these stories. We need to be reassured that there are brave men and women willing to rescue us, willing to save us, willing to die for us. That is why I came here today. Not for glory. Not for accolades. But to do my part in reassuring our great nation that we are still strong. We are still resolved. We are still united. I believe that the citizens of Great Britain will sleep sounder tonight knowing that."

Percy paused for breath and realized that people were applauding. A few people were standing up. He waited for the applause to die back down and then turned to Avery. He pinned the reporter with a look. "This is not a platform to draw attention to personal tragedies. Not when such tragedies are being felt across the country. I would ask that you respect that, and to respect my own need for privacy at this time. And now, Mr. Avery, I do believe it is time for you to exit this room."

Percy gestured for the Aurors to come down. They did and quickly whisked the reporter away. From the back, someone gave a cheer.

And already there was another reporter standing, a hand in the air, ready to ask a question. Percy glanced down at his note cards. There were so many questions left. There were so many answers to give and statements to make.

But who was dead?

Which of his brothers had died?

Percy stepped back from the podium. He tried to take in a breath, tried to steady himself. It wasn't working. He leaned back into the microphone. "My apologies. I will take no further questions."

He left the stage with an urgent step, barely hearing the murmurs from the audience.

One of his brothers was dead.

Kingsley was waiting in the wings. Percy walked past him and out the auditorium door.

Who was it? Who was dead?

Kingsley was following him. He was saying something. Percy couldn't hear him. He walked out of the building. There was a Ministry car at the curb.

What if it were Charlie? Oh, Merlin. Not Charlie.

Percy reached the car. He opened the back door.

"Percy, please wait," Kingsley said.

Percy turned. Kingsley looked distressed. Percy could extrapolate from that piece of information as well. Kingsley knew that one of his brothers was dead.

"You knew," said Percy.

Kingsley's face constricted. "The Healer said you weren't ready for the news. Percy, you're pale as a ghost. Let's find James."

"Who is it?" Percy asked.

Kingsley paused.

"Damn it, Kingsley!" Percy snapped. "Who is it?"

"Charlie," said Kingsley. "It was Charlie."

Oh, Merlin.

Percy hurriedly sat down in the back seat of the car because the world was spinning again.

"Percy, let's go back to Greenfriar," Kingsley said.

Percy pulled his legs into the car and shut the door. He engaged the lock and turned to the front seat. There was no driver – there didn't need to be a driver. "The Burrow."

The car pulled out.

Percy sucked in a breath.

Damn it, Charlie.

oOoOoOoOoOo

The black car pulled up to the house. Bill watched from the kitchen window. He'd been washing his teacup when the car had arrived, and he set the cup down now. Percy emerged from the back of the car. His robes were expensive. Bill didn't know why that was the first thing he noticed. Maybe because the sheen of his robes matched the sheen of the car.

Bill heard movement behind him and turned. Arthur had seen Percy as well.

Arthur cursed under his breath and that alerted the rest of the family.

They were all in the kitchen. The funeral was over. It'd been a short ceremony. They'd returned to the house afterwards because it was starting to rain and gradually the house had emptied leaving the Weasleys, Harry, Hermione, Severus, and Pansy.

They were all gathered around the table now because Molly had made tea, and then she'd made sandwiches, and then soup, and she would have kept going if Arthur hadn't made her sit down. The food was sitting on the table now. No one was really eating.

Bill leaned against the counter, feeling suddenly old and tired, and then the door opened and Percy stepped in.

Bill could see Percy tense as he took in the whole family, but then Percy's eyes rested on Molly.

"Mum," Percy breathed out, and he started forward.

"Where were you?"

The words were cold. The entire room looked over. Percy froze, mid-step, and turned towards Arthur. Bill hadn't heard that tone of voice from his father ever directed at one of the family before. It was usually reserved for the likes of Lucius Malfoy.

Bill looked at Percy, really looked at him, the way he used to study Draco when the teen was keeping information from him. Percy was pale. He looked tired. His eyes were pinched at the corners, which meant he was getting a headache. But there was no obvious sign of injury. No reason to why he missed the funeral.

No reason except the medal, pinned to his robes.

"I didn't know," said Percy, and there was a note of wretchedness in his voice that had Bill believing him. "I swear if I had known-,"

"How could you not know?" Arthur demanded. "We owled you. Twice!"

"The mail is – the mail is delayed," said Percy, stumbling over his words in earnestness. "It has to be searched, sorted. I haven't gotten any notice."

"His name is on the casualty list!" Fred spat, standing up from the table. "You don't need an owl for that, do you?"

Percy took a step back. Bill watched his eyes glance about the room. Percy opened his mouth, closed it, and swallowed. It could have been nerves, Bill supposed, but it looked like Percy was trying to decide what to tell them.

Percy licked his lips. "I haven't been given the casualty reports."

George scoffed. "Not so high and mighty as you make yourself out, are you?"

Percy bristled. "I've been on light duty. I was injured. The Healer hasn't cleared me for anything more than paperwork."

"Oh, so the Healer will clear you for a broadcasted press conference, but not your own brother's funeral, is that it?" Arthur asked.

"No! I didn't know about the funeral. Of course I would have come if I had known!"

Arthur stepped forward and flicked the medal on Percy's chest. "Would you have? Or were you too proud about this?"

Bill watched Percy glance down at the medal, and then back up at Arthur. Percy's face set into something stubborn.

"I behaved myself admirably during the battle, and I am proud of my actions, and proud that my actions were recognized. But that doesn't mean I would choose this medal over Charlie's funeral. Of course I wouldn't. But yes, I am proud. And I hope that you are proud of me as well." Percy paused. He took in a breath. "During the battle, when I was trying to get to the self-destruct, I-,"

"Used stealth, didn't you, Perce?" Fred called.

"Hid from Death Eaters," George added.

"We heard the whole thing," said Fred. He gestured to the radio.

Percy shook his head. "Yes, I did. That's not the full story though."

"Not the full story?" Fred asked.

"What the hell does that mean?" George asked.

"It means that he's taking credit," said Arthur, crossing his arms.

"Taking credit?" Percy repeated. His cheeks flushed, a stark contrast to his pallor. "Taking credit for something I actually did? Merlin forbid I actually recognized for saving the country when that's what I did!"

"Charlie died trying to save you!"

Bill glanced over at the table. Ron was standing, his chest heaving. His hand was clutching the table.

There was a beat of silence.

"What?" Percy asked. His face drained of all the color it had gained during the argument.

"We came across Rudy Costace," said Bill, pitching his voice gentle, because it was obvious that at the very least, Percy had truly not known about Charlie's death. "He said you were trying to get down to the seventh floor. Charlie wouldn't leave without you."

Bill watched Percy took a couple of steps backwards and shake his head. "No."

"He was worried about you," Bill continued, still gentle.

Percy scrunched his eyes shut for a moment, like he wanted to block out reality.

"We couldn't get to the floor," said Bill. "He was hit by a killing curse. He didn't suffer."

Percy let out a breath and opened his eyes. He shook his head. "He shouldn't have tried to save me."

"Shouldn't have tried?" Arthur asked. "And why is that? Is it because you weren't where you said you were? Is it because you weren't in any danger at all?"

Percy's eyes sparked. "He shouldn't have tried because there was no way he could have gotten to me. He should have just given up."

"Yes," said Arthur. "Precisely what I'm thinking."

Bill flinched at the statement and it hadn't even been directed at him. Percy let out a harsh exhale, like he'd just been punched in the gut.

"Arthur!" Molly called, her voice admonishing.

"I say dad's right," said Fred.

"Percy doesn't even care that Charlie died for him," George said.

"Don't care?" Percy asked. He strode for the table and slapped his hand down so hard that Bill jumped with the crack of it. "Don't care? You think that I don't-," Percy stopped himself, whirled around to face the door, and Bill glimpsed at his face. It was practically bloodless. Percy whirled back around to the table.

"Charlie was mine!" Percy proclaimed. He stabbed the table with his finger in emphasis. "Charlie was mine! All of you had each other. None of you even cared, but Charlie - ," Percy's breath hitched in. His body trembled. And then something in his expression turned venomous. He took a step back from the table, deliberately separating himself from the family. He spoke, his voice cold and vicious. "Charlie would be the first person to tell you all to go to hell."

The family collectively sucked a breath in, shocked into silence by the cruelty in Percy's words. Molly burst into tears. Fred lunged forward, but George grabbed onto him. And Percy –

Percy looked like he didn't even care. He turned on his heel and marched smartly out of the house.

Bill watched him through the window. He didn't get back into his car. Instead he walked to the family cemetery in the small grove in the back.

oOoOoOoOoO

The family cemetery was located in a small, continually overgrown grove of trees in the back of the Burrow. Percy had always liked the faint wildness of the plot – the moss and ivy that wound around the graves and the white and purple wildflowers that seemed to spring up as quick as grass. It was a quiet place, a quick escape from the chaos of the house. Percy had often spent his summers tucked away in this cemetery, content with a handful of books and his thoughts.

Now, though, another grave had been added. The grounds had been carefully pruned and clipped for the ceremony, and none of the peace remained.

Percy knelt by the headstone and took a breath of damp, fresh-turned earth. He brushed a hand over the inscription.

Charles Weasley

Son and Brother

Never Forgotten

Percy dropped fully to his knees. The tears that he had cried in the car ride over had dried. The only thing left was his anger.

"You're just too easy to bait, Perce," he could hear Charlie say.

The fact that the voice was only in his head didn't make it any less real.

"How, exactly?" Percy demanded of the gravestone.

"You take everything so personally," said Charlie's voice. "You know they're upset. You know they find someone to lash out at. You feed right into it, stoke the flames, and then you get mad when you get burnt. Go back in and explain. We're Weasleys, sometimes we have to be forced to listen."

"Like hell," Percy snapped. He shouldn't have to explain himself. They should have given him the benefit of the doubt. They'd give everyone except Percy a chance to explain themselves, and Percy's pride couldn't take it anymore.

He could hear Charlie sigh. "Why is it that you're at the most Weasley-est when it only hurts you? You can debate with the Wizengamot without getting angry. You can overlook an insult from a government official when etiquette asks it of you. You can turn your cheek to a whole slew of reporters when it suits you. But now that your family hurt your pride, you're holding the most epic of grudges."

Percy let out a breath. He placed a hand back on the gravestone. "Of course they took you, Charlie," he told the headstone. "You were the best of all of us."

There was no response. Percy sighed again and bowed his head. "I hope there are dragons for you to ride in the World Beyond."

A few splatters of rain fell. A couple of very deliberate footsteps warned him someone was approaching. Percy scrubbed a hand over his face and turned.

Severus Snape approached. He stopped a few feet away and inclined his head.

Percy stood. "You're looking well, Professor."

"Same to you, Assistant Minister," said Snape. "I had feared you were dead, seeing as I left you in the middle of an unpleasant conversation."

Percy heard what Snape wasn't saying. 'I'm sorry I left you to die.' He shook his head. "You were half a room away from me, Professor. And the Dark Lord is rather quick on the draw – seeing as he doesn't even need to use a wand anymore. There was no way you were going to reach me."

"Still," said Snape, "I was quite relieved to hear you survived. And I have been asked by the Civis Arma not to reveal what occurred in the Ministry, or I would have been more forthright with the Order about the crucial role you played."

Percy shrugged a shoulder. "The government needs some secrets."

"I do wonder, if perhaps it wouldn't benefit you if I did reveal more," Snape said delicately.

And Percy again heard what Snape wasn't saying. 'I could tell your parents what really happened.'

Percy scoffed. "I don't need you to fight my battles. Let them think what they will." He sucked in a breath and straightened his robes. He looked back at the house, and suddenly, it didn't seem like home anymore. "It's high time I said my good-byes."

oOoOoOoOoOo

Ginny heard the kitchen door open and glanced over. Percy re-entered. He cautiously glanced around, but there was only her and Bill left, cleaning up.

Percy cleared his throat. "I have to go back to the Ministry," he said. "Is Mum around?"

"In her chair," said Ginny.

Percy nodded and exited the room. Ginny finished drying a dish and then followed him to the living room.

Molly was sitting in her rocking chair. Her knitting was limp in her lap. Ginny watched Percy kneel beside her. She stopped rocking.

"Sorry about earlier, Mum," Percy said.

"Your brother's dead, Percy," Molly said, her voice strained. "Why did you have to say such hurtful things today of all days?"

Percy sighed. He reached out and grabbed her hand. "I know I make a mess of things sometimes."

"It's funny because you were always the neat one," Molly said, trying for a laugh. It came out a little watery.

Percy nodded and laughed a little too. "It's just… no one listens to me. I was trying to explain what really happened. Listen, Mum-,"

"We shouldn't need an explanation," Molly interjected, her voice imploring. "We should know what's happening in your life, Percy, so there aren't any explanations or excuses, but you shut us out."

"I wasn't the one who shut anyone out!" Percy said, his voice getting sharp. "Dad was the one-,"

"Please, no arguing," said Molly, her face looking pained. "Not today."

Ginny could see Percy's face fall a little, but then he schooled it into something more distant. "Of course. Not today. I won't upset you any further." He stood and kissed her cheek. "Be well, Mum."

"I love you, dear," Molly said.

Percy nodded and left the room. Ginny followed him to the door.

"Is it a good reason?" she asked.

Percy paused and turned to her.

"The reason you missed today," Ginny said. "Is it a good reason?" She could forgive him, was ready to forgive him, if he just gave her a reason.

"Good?" Percy asked. His expression morphed into sardonic, tilted lips and hard eyes. "Yes, it's a good reason. Is it good enough? Well, I think we both know the answer to that."

He gave a bland smile and left, the door closing after her with a sharp finality that echoed through the house.

oOoOoOoOoOo

Present Day…

"Well, that's a load of bollocks," said Pansy, feeling slightly let down by the whole thing. She hadn't expected the whole family drama to be caused by lack of communication. Overall, the whole thing seemed rather anti-climatic.

She watched Percy shrug and take another bite of coconut curry. About a third into his story he'd ordered take-out. He made Pansy pay for it, and for another bottle of wine, which he opened and poured this time. She was feeling slightly less guilty about drugging his dinner now that he'd had her replace it. And the bottle of wine had been pricey.

"Seriously," said Pansy, shifting to look at him more fully. "Why didn't you just tell them that you're blind? Rubbed their noses in it."

"I shouldn't have to tell them," Percy said. "No one else has to explain anything. I'm the only one that gets regularly interrogated. I'm not Weasley enough for them. Not noble enough. Not idealistic enough. Not poor enough."

Pansy snorted because it was a little bit funny. Not poor enough. Only Gryffindors would use poverty as a signal of superiority. The noble and honorable poor.

"You laugh, but it's true," said Percy. He put down his carton of curry and picked up his wine glass. "I'm too refined. Too polished." He gestured around him at his apartment, and Pansy laughed again.

His house was not refined. It was expensive, to be sure, and full of high-quality goods, but it was too comfortable to be refined. She looked at Percy, in his jeans and t-shirt, take-out on the coffee table, wine glass in his hands. His cheeks were slightly flushed from the wine. His bare feet were propped up on the table, his long toes curled over the edge. There was something refined about Percy though, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.

"Too conniving," Percy said, a dark note in his voice. He took another sip of wine.

"Hardly," said Pansy.

Percy looked over at her. "You don't think I'm conniving?"

"You're not as clever as you think," said Pansy. "I mean, I just took you down. You knew I was someone up to no good, and you still invited me over, and you still ended up unconscious on the floor." She arched her eyebrow at him. "Sounds to me like you're a little stupid."

Percy shook his head. "That was simple risk-benefit analysis. I factored the potential benefit to be higher than the risk, and seeing as I'm still alive, it paid off."

"What potential benefit could you possible get from having me over?" Pansy asked. A sudden though hit her, and she felt a little disappointed. "Please tell me the benefit wasn't sex."

"What?" Percy spluttered. "No! I don't want to have sex with you!"

He sounded so sure of it that for one moment Pansy was slightly offended. "Well, why the hell did you invite me over?"

Percy turned to her. "I wanted to meet my niece."

OoOoOoOoO

Please review! :-D





12. Frustration and Belief

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a crick in my neck. Blerg!

Author's Note: So sorry I didn't get around to reply to all your lovely reviews. This was a very last minute chapter. A moment of "oh crap! I need to get this up, stat!" But I appreciate every one of them!

OoOoOoOoO

Six Months Ago…

Pansy stared down at her daughter in the crib. Barely a month had passed since she'd given birth, and still the awe and fear and wonderment that came with being a mother hadn't faded. Pansy reached out and gently traced a finger over her daughter's cheek. She watched her baby stir a little. Her tiny face scrunched ever-so-slightly. A soft gurgle left her lips, and then she stilled again.

Pansy walked to the window and pushed back the yellow lace curtain to peer outside. She could see the ocean from here. And the dozen-or-so houses that made up the village.

No one knew who Pansy was here. No one knew her family. No one knew the father of her baby had been killed in the battle at the Ministry of Magic. No one knew she was keeping her baby a secret.

Because the baby was all that was left of Charlie. And Pansy couldn't fathom letting anyone else hold her baby, or kiss her baby, or cuddle her baby. She couldn't share her. Didn't think she'd ever be able to share her.

A small, coughing sort of cry sounded from the crib. Pansy was immediately there, reaching down to scoop her daughter up.

"What's the matter, Charlotte? Did Mummy wake you up?

OoOoOoOoO

Present Day…

"And this is the Slytherin common room," said Blaise, sweeping his arm out.

Draco stepped past him into the room and looked around curiously. He knew that the castle – or rather, school – had been abandoned after a messy fight with the Death Eaters. He'd seen some of the damage on the way in. A splintered door. A few cracked stones. A halfway demolished wall. The interior of the school had less battle damage, but it was still suffering from the lack of upkeep.

There was a layer of dust over the room. Cobwebs were thick in the corners and in the windows. A few animal tracks could be seen through the dust, mice, rats, and perhaps a small cat. A rustling in the rafters suggested that birds had found a way in.

But underneath the grime, Draco could see the room had once been a decadent place to meet, far nicer than anything he expected for a school. A marble fireplace. Silver candlesticks and torches along the walls. Plush looking furniture.

Blaise stepped past him and did a quick check for anything dangerous. When the school had been evacuated, Headmaster Dumbledore had pulled down the protective wards, choosing to let the creatures that had been contained in the school to overrun the castle rather than letting it fall into Death Eater hands.

Draco had been horrible confused when Bill had tried explaining it to him, so Hermione had lent him a book to read, Hogwarts: A Dark History.

Draco had spent two days poring over the text because it offered an incredible amount of detail into the magical world. It answered a lot of questions he had pondered, but it also created more questions. He'd followed Hermione around for a couple days and pestered her with them. Of all the occupants of the Manor, she seemed the most knowledgeable about the intricacies of the magical world. Those who had been born into magic simply accepted their reality instead of actively questioning it. Hermione hadn't seemed to mind. In fact, she was a surprisingly patient teacher.

From the book, Draco had been horrified to learn that there was all matter of supernatural creatures locked away in Hogwarts. Apparently it was easier to trap certain creatures instead of destroying or relocating them, and so children had gone to school in a veritable prison for shades and banshees and so forth. It didn't seem exactly safe to Draco.

"You used to sit there," Blaise said, pointing to a chair beside the fireplace. "You ruled over the rest of the house, even when you were only a first year."

"Huh," said Draco, not quite knowing what that meant. He'd gathered that he wasn't always the nicest of kids when he was younger, and that he was arrogant and prideful. But had he ruled over the house because he was smart or because he was rich? Because he was popular or because he was feared?

He didn't ask Blaise for clarification. He wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer. He let Blaise finish sweeping the room in silence. During their planning meeting, Bill had told Draco to stay behind the others so he didn't stumble into anything hidden and dangerous. Draco had readily agreed. He was being taught to duel, and in the past couple of weeks, he'd been advancing rather quickly. His body seemed to remember casting positions and forms even though he had no memory of it. But no matter how good his muscle memory, Draco still had a lot to learn. He was the weakest member of the team.

He was content to follow Blaise through the common room and then the different dormitories. Draco had been told to look for anything that sparked his memory, seemed familiar, or caught his eye. Bill was sure that he would have spelled whatever capsule he stored his memory in to have a sort of beacon attached to it, so Draco could find it again. The trouble was nothing sparked his memory. Nothing looked familiar. And too much caught his eye.

Like the ghost that appeared to be hanging from the ceiling, content to watch them with a dark gaze. And the moving portraits. And the frankly too-large, too-grand beds that the students slept in. Were the carved bedposts and velvet curtains really necessary?

Draco and Blaise circled back to the common room. Blaise looked at him, eyebrows raised. Draco shrugged. "Nothing."

"It's a big castle," said Blaise. "Let's meet up with the rest and see if they found anything interesting."

Draco nodded and followed Blaise out. The castle corridors were similarly covered in the collected film of dust from misuse, but again, Draco could see past that. He saw grand hallways, sculpted ceilings, and ornate stonework. He wished he remembered attending the school and viewing the building in all of its grandeur.

Bill and Hermione were still in the hall where Blaise and Draco had left them about an hour ago. They were still trying to gain entryway to the Headmaster's office.

"No luck?" Blaise asked.

Bill looked a little bit frazzled. "I'm not going to be able to break it. The wards are too strong. And I can't try any of the more powerful spells because I don't want to bring a lot of attention towards us. I'm surprised we haven't woken anything up yet."

As soon as the words left his mouth, there was a shriek down the hallway.

"Merlin's balls," Bill cursed. "Draco, stay here."

He took off down the hall, Blaise following him. Hermione paused just long enough to make sure that Draco really was staying put, and then followed after them. Draco let them go. He wasn't going to be any help against a goblin or ghost or banshee or whatever it was.

He waited by the gargoyles and gave them a sidelong look. Before they had left for Hogwarts, Bill and the others had set about listing every candy they could think of. Apparently the passwords were usually sweet related.

"Candy is a stupid password to have," Draco told the gargoyles now. He could hear faint yelling from further up in the castle. He could make out a few shouted spells and a few curses of the frustrated kind. Draco propped his arm against one of the gargoyle's head. "Still, I suppose if you're stupid enough to think that Potter's not the Chosen one then -,"

The gargoyle moved underneath his arm, and with a yelp, Draco tumbled back a little. He managed to keep his footing, and whirled around to see the stonewall slide away and a winding staircase appear.

Draco paused for a moment. He knew it probably wasn't wise, heading up the magical staircase on his own, but the others were busy. And Draco wasn't quite sure how long the door would stay open for. And he wasn't sure if it had opened due to what he'd said, or his voice in particular.

So Draco gripped his wand a little tighter and started up the stone staircase. It was a rather tight staircase, circular and winding, and when he reached the top, the wooden door opened easily. Draco cautiously stepped out into the next room.

It was an office, that much was apparent. There was a large, carved wooden desk in the center of the room. Bookshelves lined the walls, cluttered with books and various items that looked like knick-knacks, but could have been the magical equivalent of a bomb as far as Draco could tell. He decided to look rather than touch, stepping close to the shelves and staring so intently he wasn't aware of anyone else in the room until a throat cleared.

Draco whirled around, belatedly remembering to raise his wand and not his fists. There was no one there.

"Over here, Mr. Malfoy," said the voice.

It was a kind voice. Gentle.

Draco cast around and then spotted the portrait hanging on the wall behind the desk. It was dust-covered, but the face behind it was visible. It was an old man with a long white beard and blue eyes that squinted at the corners in good humor.

"Hello," said Draco. He stared at the portrait for a moment longer, trying to get some sort of feel for the Headmaster. He was pre-disposed to dislike the man. He'd based that opinion on knowledge he'd gleaned second hand. That Dumbledore had raised Harry Potter to be the savior of the Wizarding World and then given up on him. That the Order followed him with an unshakeable loyalty that bordered on cultish. That he'd been a powerful wizard in his own right before becoming the Headmaster of a school. But the visage of the wizard was harmless. Comforting even. Like a grandfather.

"It's been a while," said Dumbledore.

"Things have really gone to shit," Draco agreed.

Dumbledore smiled a little. "You appear the most affected, Draco. You're not yourself."

"Wiped my memories," Draco said, and then shrugged. "We're here looking for them."

"Might I inquire as to why you wiped your memories in the first place?"

"I translated the Merlin Code," said Draco.

He could see the surprise on Dumbledore's face. "The Merlin Code."

"Don't suppose you know what it does?" Draco asked.

The portrait tipped his head to the side. "You don't know yourself? Even though you went through all the trouble to erase your memories to do it?"

Draco raised his arms and dropped them in a helpless gesture. "I don't remember a thing, and I didn't leave myself any notes, so…," he trailed off. "But you're supposed to be pretty smart, aren't you? Or are you less smart now that you're a picture?"

"I retain some insights," said Dumbledore, rather enigmatically. It made Draco frown a bit. He was without a memory. He didn't need anymore mysteries.

"The Merlin Code?" he prompted.

"It was a potent form of magic," said Dumbledore. "Some say it was magic itself, just in written form. Merlin himself developed it, and only he could wield it. It was said the runes he used were so powerful that they could survive generations."

"And what does it do?" Draco asked.

"Practically anything you want it to do," said Dumbledore.

"Like pull a horcrux out of Potter?" Draco asked.

Dumbledore paused a moment. "Perhaps," he said finally. "But that would take more than the code. It would take some sort of… exorcism spell to pull it from Harry, and I don't know of any spell with that purpose."

"Is it possible it exists?" Draco asked.

"You may have even found it for all I know," said Dumbledore. "You were looking into horcruxes."

"I was?" Draco asked, surprised.

"You were researching a knife," said Dumbledore. "The one that gave you that scar." He nodded at Draco's arm, and then at the desk. There was a book on the surface. "I was looking into it as well."

"But if I did find the ritual, I won't know it until I have my memories back," said Draco.

"Quite," Dumbledore agreed. "Although you may have had another purpose of deciphering the code."

Draco raised an eyebrow. Dumbledore looked at him, expression severe. "You may have been researching weapons."

"Weapons?"

"What is Merlin known for?" Dumbledore asked.

Draco shrugged. "King Arthur. Camelot. The Sword in the Stone." He paused when Dumbledore smiled. "The Sword in the Stone? Excalibur? Really?"

"Merlin gave Excalibur to King Arthur to help him eradicate England of threats – both magical and non-magical. The sword is a powerful weapon, and although it's been lost to the ages, if you knew the Merlin Code, you could find it and wield it in your battle against Voldemort."

Draco paused for a moment to process that information, but then a piece of Dumbledore's wording snagged at him. "Wait – my battle against Voldemort? You mean Harry's battle, right? If I found a magical sword, I'd give it to him."

Dumbledore said nothing. Draco found himself getting angry. "I'm not the Chosen One."

"You may have come around to my point of view before wiping your memories," Dumbledore said. "Harry can't kill Voldemort as long as the horcrux is in him, not even with Excalibur."

"Then the code is to help pull it out of him," said Draco.

"You're too intelligent to deny that I have a point," said Dumbledore. "And believe me, I don't take this consideration lightly. It devastates me to think that Harry is not the savior. I believed in him, truly, but -,"

"Does belief stop because it gets hard?" Draco interrupted. "Do you stop believing when it becomes inconvenient?"

"All beliefs need reevaluation at times," Dumbledore countered. "To hold a belief without ever questioning it, without ever searching it, is folly."

"Don't confuse questioning with cowardice," Draco snapped back. "It's healthy to question, even to doubt, but if the only reason you are doubting is because you've hit a snag, then you're just giving up."

"It's not a snag; it's an impasse."

"A few weeks ago, I had no idea any of this was possible," said Draco, gesturing out at the office. "Magic. Wizards. Witches. Spells and curses. Potions and charms. Unicorns and dragons. It would have sounded impossible to me."

"Don't belittle how much I have tried to make Harry into the Chosen One. I have searched for an answer. I have scoured everything I could."

"Everything you could," Draco said. "You didn't ask anyone else. Don't you think that's giving up too easily? If you truly believed in Harry, you would enlist everyone else's help. But it was easier to think that maybe I was the Chosen One instead. When did you lose faith in him?"

"I never lost faith in him," Dumbledore countered. "If there would be anyone to save the world, it would be Harry Potter. He has the heart for it."

"And I don't," said Draco.

Dumbledore shook his head. "You were always more selfish, more self-serving than Potter."

"So why did you give up on him?"

"Because as much as we live in a world of magic, we do not live in a fairy-tale," said Dumbledore. "The hero of the story is not always the noble one. And the noble one is not always the hero. And the ending is usually more bitter-sweet than happily-ever-after."

Draco paused a moment. "Maybe so," he allowed. "But I don't believe it. Do you know what I do believe in?"

It was a rhetorical question. The Headmaster said nothing.

"Belief," said Draco. "I believe in the power of belief. Humans are the only creatures in the world that can hold onto hope and faith and belief so hard that they end up changing their own destiny. Belief can give life, and take life. It can start wars, and end them. It can make possible what should be impossible. That is true magic, Headmaster. And I still believe in Harry Potter."

Dumbledore was silent for a moment, but then he inclined his head.

"That doesn't mean you think I'm right, does it?" Draco asked.

"No," said Dumbledore. "But I've learned something today. I learned that I believe in you, Draco Malfoy. You may be the hero of this story yet."

Draco snorted and turned to leave. Then he turned around and snagged the book off the Headmaster's desk. He left the office and headed down the stairs.

He could hear the others even before the wall swung open. They were trying to get through, no doubt thinking he was trapped inside. He smirked a little at them as he stepped through the office.

Bill grabbed his shoulders. "Draco, are you okay? What happened?"

Draco pushed him back, gently. "I'm fine. The door opened, I found the office, had a philosophical debate with a painting, and then left."

"What's that?" Blaise asked, gesturing to the book in his hands. "Did you find your memories?"

Draco shook his head. "I just picked up some light reading. We can leave. My memories aren't going to be here."

"You're sure?" Ginny asked.

Draco looked around the school, derelict and deserted. He thought of the Headmaster upstairs, and the opposing viewpoints they shared. He didn't feel comfortable here. Draco nodded. "Definitely not here."

He could tell some of them wanted to object. Not because anyone really wanted to search a deserted castle, but because this had been one of the last places to look. They were reluctant to give up.

The group was silent as they filed back out of the castle and started the walk back down to Hogsmeade.

Draco knew they were thinking the same thoughts. They had already searched his chateau in France and found nothing. They were halfway through sorting through Malfoy Manor, and had turned up nothing yet.

They were all frustrated and tired and desperate.

It was just about dinnertime when they made it back to the Manor. Mrs. Weasley was waiting for them in the parlor when they Flooed back. She jumped up to greet them, hopeful and optimistic.

Bill shook his head.

She was disappointed, Draco could tell she was, but she forced a smile anyway. "Well, at least you're all safe and sound." She greeted her boys – Bill and Ron – with a kiss and a gentle swat to get washed up for dinner. Harry got a kiss, no swat. And then she pulled Draco into an embrace and held for a moment.

It felt comforting. Her arms were soft, but strong. She smelled like the food she'd been cooking, fresh bread, baked chicken, and vegetables picked from the garden.

"Don't fret. You'll figure it out," she told him.

Draco squeezed her back and then left for his room, ready the change out of the dust-ridden clothes he was wearing. He pulled on clean casual garments and then hunted for a pair of socks in the bottom drawer of the wardrobe. His fingers brushed against something buried beneath the neatly folded socks, something wood and flat, and for a brief moment, he wondered if he'd actually been stupid enough to hide his memories in his sock drawer – and then he wondered if he was doubly stupid for not having found it until now.

He pulled the object out. It turned out to be a picture frame, not a secret container for his memories, and the photo inside was of his parents.

He recognized his parents from the large family portrait hanging in the private library. It was a professional photo, taken when he appeared to be about eleven or so, gawky and sharp-chinned. It was a cold sort of photo. Wizarding pictures moved, but there had been no movement in that portrait, just steely gazes and the occasional slow blink from Draco. His father had looked stern and severe. Narcissa had looked vacant and insipid.

This photo was different. It was a candid photo, and it appeared to have been taken on his parents' wedding day. Lucius was dressed in fine silver robes. He was holding Narcissa's hand, leading her down a set of wide marble steps. Narcissa was in a gown of lace so delicate it appeared to be floating as she moved.

Lucius was looking at Narcissa, and he was smiling, just enough to be obvious. And Narcissa was gazing back at him, something pleased but nervous in her face, like she was afraid it was all too good to be true.

Draco sat on the floor and stared at the photo. No one was telling him much about his parents. He had learned that Lucius was dead – but that his ghost made occasional appearances around Wizarding London. No one knew why or how or where he was. And anytime Draco tried to broach the subject of finding him, his arm was patted or he was given a sympathetic smile.

And when he tried to speak of his mother, the subject was almost immediately changed. Draco had finally annoyed Snape into telling him, rather curtly, that his mother was addicted to pleasure potions and would sell her entire family out for some quick cash. And Snape had made some allusions to abuse, but hadn't exactly come out and said that she was abusive outright, so it just left Draco with more questions than answers.

And that was why he stared at the photo now, because his parents looked… well, normal in the photo. Yes, more reserved than other couples might have been on their wedding day, and probably wearing more jewels and finery than average, but overall, they looked like people. Real people, not some half-dead ghost that his father was now, or some evil step-mother-like character his mother was made out to be.

Draco reached out and gently traced the frame with his fingers. He hadn't been able to learn where his mother was staying, and he doubted anyone would tell him.

A knock on the door startled him out of his thoughts. "Coming to dinner, Draco?"

That was Ginny at his door. Draco hastily shoved the photo back and pulled out a pair of socks at random.

"Coming!" he called.

He walked with her down to dinner, and spent the meal trying to distract himself with thoughts of his family. It was hard though, because the Weasleys were the epitome of family. They all looked alike. They spoke alike. Their love for each other was blindingly obvious.

Draco found himself getting more and more restless throughout the meal, and he excused himself before dessert under the pretext of wanting to search some more for his memories. He sorted through the second floor music room, and by the time he finished, he knew a great deal about classical music in the wizarding world, but absolutely nothing about himself or his parents.

He went to bed irritated, and woke up early, just as agitated as before. He got out of bed and crossed to the window. The sun would be rising in a few minutes. The sky was getting lighter in the east. He went to the wardrobe, pulled on clothes suitable for a run, and then grabbed his iPod from the top of his dresser.

No one else was awake when he slipped out of the house. He stretched a little bit and surveyed the grounds, tracking out the best route, and when he'd planned it, slipped the earbuds into his ears, cranked up his workout playlist, and started running.

Running had been his release during the months in New York City – and he was pretty sure, by the shape he was in, that it had been his release from the very beginning of translating the code. He ran well, fast and hard and long.

There was something physically pleasurable of working out his body as hard as he worked out his mind, and there was always leftover energy at the end of a long day of decoding. And there was also a great deal of frustration to burn off as well.

So he ran. He ran down towards the stables and then turned up to run by the creek. And then he ran a path through the outer gardens and then through the old orchard. He ran behind the manor and took the path through the woods. There was a slight hill he had to strain to get up – he was a little out of shape for not running these past few weeks. Not that he was physically out of shape. Dueling was a high-intensity workout he hadn't been expecting, but rather he was out of shape for running. He'd ran a half-marathon in New York. He had been training for a full marathon when Bill had found him.

Draco counted the miles now as he ran. One mile, then two, then three. He re-traced his steps, ran up and down the rows of the rose garden, and then lapped the Manor. Four, five, six. He darted out to the woods again, and slowly became aware that he wasn't running alone. There was a big black dog running through the woods as well.

Draco didn't know if it was his dog or not, or maybe a stray dog. The dog appeared to be keeping his distance, so Draco paid it no mind and started back to lap the Manor again.

He was just passing one of the back patios when he noticed the child sitting on the steps.

Draco slowed to a stop and pulled the headphones out of one ear. He gulped in a few breaths of air and then pulled his hands up to his head as a stitch started to form in his side. He stared at the child. The child stared back.

The child was a young boy. His hair was a pale strawberry blonde. Draco didn't know how to guess his age. He was drinking out of a plastic cup with a lid on it. He saw Draco, got up, and walked over. He lifted his drink in offering.

"Juice?" he asked.

"Uh, no, thanks," said Draco.

"You ran a lot," said the boy.

"Yes," said Draco.

"You're really sweaty."

"Yes," said Draco again. "Shouldn't you be inside? With your parents?"

He suddenly realized he didn't know who this child was, or who his parents were, or whether or not they were still alive. Thankfully the child didn't burst into tears. He just shrugged, which meant they were very much alive.

"Mum said I could go out with Sirius."

Draco looked around, but couldn't spot the man anywhere.

"Over there, silly," the boy laughed, and then pointed.

Draco turned and saw the big, black dog bounding up, and then suddenly it wasn't a dog anymore but Sirius Black and the transformation was so suddenly and startling that Draco tripped backwards and ended up on his butt in the grass.

The boy burst into peals of laughter. Draco scowled. He'd read about animaguses, thank you very much, he just hadn't been expecting it.

Sirius laughed as well, a loud guffaw, and then he dropped to the grass as well, looking just as winded as Draco was.

"Didn't peg you for a runner," he told Draco.

Draco shrugged. "Sometimes it helps."

"Did it help today?"

Draco rolled out his shoulders, stretched out his legs, and bent forward to touch his toes. "Too early to tell."

The boy sat down between them and took a drink of his juice. "Mum is making waffles for breakfast. I asked her pacifically."

"Specifically," Sirius corrected.

The boy shrugged, unconcerned. "I like waffles."

"Who's your mum?" Draco asked.

The boy blinked at him, confusion on his face.

"That's Bill and Fleur's eldest, Lukas," Sirius said.

"Oh," said Draco. Bill had said that he had kids, but Draco hadn't seen them yet.

"And you're Draco," said Lukas. "You're my godfather. 'Sephone has Remus as her godfather, and everyone said it was too bad he wasn't my godfather too, because they thought you were dead."

He said it so matter-of-factly that Draco blinked a couple of times. Godfather? Him?

He turned to Sirius for confirmation who nodded.

"I'm your godfather," Draco said to Lukas, just triple-checking.

The boy nodded again.

"And 'Sephone'?"

"Persephone," Sirius corrected. "His sister."

"If you were dead, like Uncle Charlie, do you think Remus would be my godfather too?" Lukas asked. "I like his stories. And his hot chocolate. Sometimes he puts whip cream and marshmallows on it."

Sirius laughed. "Stiff competition in the godfather field. Whip cream and marshmallows. How are you ever going to compete?"

Draco let himself fall back onto the grass. Now that he was stationary, suddenly he was tired. And hungry. "I don't know. I'm a genius and rich. I'm sure I'll think of something." He looked over at Sirius. "What do wizarding kids want?"

Sirius shrugged. "A broom, maybe."

Draco looked over at Lukas. "You want a broom?"

"You better not be bribing my son," a voice cut in. Draco turned his head over to see Bill joining them, a mug of coffee in hand. "You look like you just ran to Diagon Alley, Draco."

"Just around the yard," said Draco.

"Over a dozen kilometers, I'd say," said Sirius.

Bill looked at Draco. His brow was knit. "Why?"

Draco heaved a sigh. "Why do you think?"

Bill looked a little bit stricken, and Draco hadn't meant to make him feel bad, so he forced a smile and heaved himself up. "I'm going to shower. See you at breakfast."

He headed back to his room, and if he lingered in the shower longer than usual, he told himself it was because he was really sweaty and not because he was trying to delay another day of pointless searching. He finally headed down the breakfast. There were indeed waffles, although Lukas and the other children dined separately from the Order members. Draco snagged a waffle and then piled his plate with eggs and ham. He nearly dropped the plate when Bill spoke up.

"We may need to consider the possibility that Draco's memories aren't here."

"Seconded," Draco said quickly, relieved someone else was realizing what he was.

"We've made a list," said Hermione. "It makes sense."

"We may need to think more creatively," said Bill.

Draco took a seat next to Ginny. She was looking pensive.

"Where else can we look?" Fred asked.

"We don't know anywhere else," George said.

"What about people?" Hermione asked. "People who knew Draco when he was younger who might know if he had a favorite spot or place."

Draco sat up a little. His parents, surely. They would be the ones to ask.

"Blaise may have some suggestions," said Bill. "Or maybe Pansy."

"Blaise is still sleeping," said Ron. "And Pansy's out."

"We'll catch them later," said Bill. "If they can think of anyone, it'd be useful."

"What about Percy?" Ginny asked.

Her words were met with an uncomfortable sort of silence.

Ginny shrugged a little. "Draco and Percy worked together on a few things. Fudge's assassination. Kingsley's election. It's possible he might have some suggestions."

"Yeah, but who actually wants to go talk to the git?" Fred asked.

"Not I," said George.

"I doubt we'll need his assistance," Arthur said stiffly.

"Ginny's got a point," said Bill. "We'll need all the suggestions we can get."

"I'd go, but I've got work today," said Ginny. "Anyone else free to take Draco?"

"I'm pretty sure I could get there myself," said Draco.

"I could go," Harry offered.

"No," said Bill, shaking his head. "I'll go." He looked over at Draco. "Let's leave in an hour."

Draco nodded, but couldn't help but notice Bill looked less than thrilled as the prospect of visiting his younger brother.

OoOoOoOoO

"Assistant? You have visitors in the lobby."

Percy looked up from his paperwork and frowned. "Visitors?" Who the hell would be visiting him? For a brief moment, he wondered if it was Pansy, but ever since he revealed he knew about her daughter, Pansy had vanished.

Well, not vanished. Percy knew where his niece was living. A cute little coastal village in Scotland, as far away from the mess of the war as possible. He was tempted to travel there himself. He was desperate to see Charlie's daughter. He wanted to know how much of Charlie remained. Did she have the Weasley hair? Did she have Charlie's eyes or nose? Was she healthy?

But Percy knew it wouldn't be Pansy. And Deanna had said visitors, plural. He raised an eyebrow at her.

"Your brother Bill and Draco Malfoy."

Percy put down his paperwork. "Draco Malfoy," he said.

"Shall I send them up?"

Percy was going to say yes. It was instinctual to say yes and just deal with the disapproving glares and unhappy frowns. He was used to allowing his family in only to have them turn their backs on him. He stopped himself. "Show Mr. Malfoy up. My brother can wait."

Deanna looked a little curious, but she nodded. She left with a brisk stride and Percy put his paperwork down, careful not to shuffle the loose pages and lose his place. He glanced over to Kingsley's desk. The Minister was currently in a meeting. He wouldn't be back for another hour or so. That would afford them privacy at least. Percy didn't think Draco Malfoy would be here for anything less than vital importance, and it would be best to keep it secret.

Deanna appeared only a few minutes later with Draco Malfoy in tow. Percy hadn't thought he'd ever use that descriptor, 'in tow', to describe Draco Malfoy. He had always been a striding force, but here he was now, gaping around at his surroundings, trailing after the secretary and not quite keeping up.

"Would you close the door behind you?" Percy asked Deanna.

She nodded, ushered Draco in, and then gently shut the door, leaving them in privacy. Percy gestured to the chair in front of his desk and Draco took a seat.

"I've been informed you lost your memories," Percy started.

"News travels fast," said Draco, shrugging a little and sitting back in the seat. No, slouched in the seat.

"Bad news, certainly," said Percy.

Draco laughed a bit, also disconcerting. "I heard you and your family don't get along."

"And now that we've both established we can state the obvious, I suppose we can move onto something a little more relevant," said Percy curtly, not quite appreciating the reference to his family.

Draco's eyes flicked over him, like Percy was an extra piece he was trying to fit into a puzzle. Percy carefully stacked his paperwork onto a corner of the desk, measuring the distance to the edge with his fingertips. He liked his desk to be accessible to him even without his glasses. He leaned over the cleared area.

"What are you here for?"

Draco shrugged. "I was told we got along, back when I had my memories."

"We had a working relationship."

"A good one?"

"It was satisfactory," Percy said.

Draco grinned a little. "From what I gather, we're two peas in pod. Sorry, I have to ask, is that why they don't like you?"

Percy's fingers drifted around his desk, an obsessive-compulsive need to straighten and double-check that everything was in its place. A stress reaction to Draco's question, even though he knew Draco was asking something else entirely. "Are you really here to discuss my relationship with my family?"

"It was suggested that you may have some idea where my memories are," Draco said.

Percy paused for a moment. "I didn't know you that well." His fingers slid over a stray paperclip. He stuck it back into the small bowl on his desk. "Where have you looked so far?"

Draco frowned at him for a moment and then his eyebrows shot up. "Your glasses let you see? That's amazing. How do they work? Is the visual defect in your eyes or your brain?"

Percy sat back, startled. "How did you - ?"

Draco gestured at his desk. "You don't look at what you're doing. Most people do. And you measure the space between objects on your desk. So… you're blind, right? And the glasses give you sight?"

"Of course," said Percy. He let out a sigh. "Of all the people to notice, it's you."

He could see Draco pause at that, and knew the young man was drawing conclusions.

"Your family doesn't know," Draco surmised.

"No," Percy agreed.

"So it happened recently," said Draco. "Most likely during that Ministry battle everyone keeps talking about. But you're not saying anything to them about it."

"And you won't either," said Percy. "That information is confidential. Now would you care to elaborate on how I can help you with your memories?"

He could tell Draco had more questions. It was apparent in the way he hesitated, and then shrugged.

"We've looked everywhere they've thought of," said Draco. "Hogwarts, my home in France, we're halfway through the Manor, but I don't think my memories are kept there. We're running out of ideas, so they thought I should ask other people that know me."

Percy shook his head a little in exasperation. "I don't understand why they'd send you here of all places when there's someone who knows you much better than I."

Draco leaned in, a look of eagerness on his face that looked out of place. "Who?"

"Your father," said Percy.

Draco tipped his head to the side. "He's dead."

"Not entirely," said Percy. "Have Ginny contact him. She knows how."

"What?" Draco demanded.

Percy shrugged. "I don't know how, but she can. My family won't like it of course. They have a particular bland of distaste for Lucius Malfoy." He paused a moment, and then when Draco didn't ask, he prompted, "Are you going to ask me or not?"

Draco sat back in his chair, looking a little impressed. "You're quick."

"You're still not asking," said Percy. "And I'm a busy man."

"How is it, if you're so much like me, that your family doesn't like you?" Draco asked.

Percy shook his head. "Wrong question."

"How is it," Draco tried again, "that if I'm so much like you, your family still likes me? Or are they faking it?"

"You weren't raised a Weasley," said Percy. "They have different expectations for you, different… allowances."

"So they don't like me," said Draco.

Percy shook his head. "No, I'm sure they do. It's just… they recognize that you're going to be different. That you'll have different opinions and different values. But to be raised in a Weasley family, and to openly disagree… well, that's the ultimate sin. I'm pretty sure my family would like me more if I weren't related to them as well."

He couldn't tell if Draco was comforted by his words or not.

Draco shook his head. "Well, if we're really the same, and knowing what I know about who I was with my memories, I'm pretty sure you're creating half of your own problems. You could have brought Bill up."

Percy suddenly had a vision of Draco revealing his blindness with Bill in the room. What would Bill do? What would he say? He was sure his older brother would feel terrible. He was sure that his entire family would come running to him.

Half of Percy wanted to see them rushing towards him, words of apologies on their lips, expressions of guilt on their faces. Half of Percy wanted them to never know, and to take his anger to the grave, the ultimate act of defiance.

Percy sighed and rubbed at his temples. "I'm not so much creating my problems as I am avoiding them. And our conversation is to remain confidential, is that clear?"

Draco stood and nodded. "Not my place to tell," he said.

Percy let out a breath. "Thank you. And best of luck to you, Mr. Malfoy."

Draco inclined his head. "Assistant Minister."

He left the office. Percy watched him leave, looked back at his paperwork, and then sighed. He needed a cup of coffee.

oOoOoOoOo

Oh goodness, it is late at night. I can't proof-read anymore. But, you all were so nice in pointing out my rather silly typo the chapter before, so hopefully you'll do it again if I do something equally as ridiculous. Please leave a review on your way out!





13. Family Encounters

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I do own a television now. I've been glued to the Olympics, which is why this is late, lol.

Author's Note: Lucius is back!

OoOoOoOoO

Three and a half years ago…

Draco woke up knowing something was wrong. His head throbbed. His thoughts felt heavy and cumbersome. His eyes took a moment to open, like his neurons were on a three-second delay. He blinked, eyelids sticking slightly, and took in his surroundings. He'd never seen this room before.

Well – that is, he didn't remember seeing this room before. He was aware that he kept losing his memory. He was aware that he kept moving cities. He could have seen this room before, he supposed, but the fact that he was currently tied to a wooden chair made him think he'd been kidnapped and taken to some secret location.

Vague memories started drifting back to him. Dark figures. Flashes of light. Something hitting him in the chest. It hadn't been an object. It'd been a red, sparkly light with some unknown force behind it. A ray gun of some sort? A new type of taser?

He'd blacked out right afterwards.

And now he was awake in this room. It was windowless, bare walls and floors. There was a table in the room, a couple of feet across from the chair he was tied to, and a closed door. Nothing else.

Draco tried to pull against the bonds, but as soon as he pressed against the ropes, they constricted, almost on their own, tightening hard enough to bruise. Draco immediately stopped struggling. He craned his neck, trying to see the bonds, but his arms were caught up behind him, lashed to the back of the chair, and he couldn't get a good look.

The door was flung open.

Draco jerked his head up, startled. A woman entered, rather dramatically. She was ginning madly. Her hair was a tangle of black curls, lightly streaked with gray. Her eyes were just as dark. Her skin paper-pale. She wore a black robe and the only pop of color was her red mouth and her long, pointed nails, painted the color of blood. ,She carried a stick in her hand – some sort of carved, wooden wand.

"Thought you could hide from me, Draco?" she asked, voice pitched high, taunting.

"Who are you?" Draco demanded. "What do you want?"

"Obviously I want whatever it is you're working on," said the woman. She sauntered in close, stopping right in front of him, and then she bent down. Her hands grabbed his chin and pulled his face up to hers. Her nails bit into his jaw. "You've been gone for so long. Your Auntie Bellatrix was worried."

Draco was pretty sure she was referring to herself in the third person. She had the sort of crazed look about her that said she'd totally call herself by her own name. He was still surprised at the family connection. He blinked up at her. "You're my aunt?"

"Don't play coy, Draco. What does the Order have you working on?"

The words didn't make sense to him. He shook his head. "Look, Ms. Bellatrix, I have no idea what you're talking about. In fact, I don't even know who you are."

She rolled her eyes, pointed the wooden stick at him, and said, "Crucio!"

Invisible fire washed over him.

Draco jerked backwards, screaming at the sudden pain. He barely realized that he'd knocked the chair over. It splintered underneath him, the ropes melting away, but he was only aware he was free of the bond when his limbs flailed, trying to escape the pain.

The fire stopped just as abruptly as it had begun. Draco caught his breath, gasping and shaking and completely horrified. He shrank back as Bellatrix took a step towards him.

"Are you ready to talk?"

Draco pulled in a breath. "I swear I have no idea who you are. I don't know what you're talking about." She raised the stick again. Draco felt panic well up. "I swear I don't –," he cut off as she waved the stick again.

"Crucio!"

Fire.

Draco screamed. He dropped back on the floor, body jerking, trying to escape. He screamed because of the pain and because he didn't understand what was happening. He didn't understand how she had such power over his body, to make his nerve endings light up and burn.

The pain stopped. Draco pushed himself to the back wall, his limbs shaking and trembling. He stared at the woman, eyes wide and an unbelievable thought taking hold in his brain. He looked at the stick in her hand. Wand, he suspected. He lifted his gaze to the woman's face.

"Is that… magic?"

She paused. Her head tilted to the side. Her dark eyes studied him. "You aren't yourself. What have you done?"

Draco shook his head. "I don't know. I don't remember."

"Memory spell," she said.

Draco let out a breath of disbelief. Memory spell? What the hell was that? Was it even possible?

No, of course it wasn't possible. He was scared. And in pain. His mind was latching onto unrealistic possibilities.

Bellatrix knelt down in front of him and scooted forward. Draco flinched back, hitting the wall, no where to go. Her face pressed close to his and he turned away, bracing himself for more pain. He could feel her breath against his cheek. She laughed and then pressed a quick kiss to his cheek before pulling back a couple of inches. Draco carefully turned his head to her.

"I'll tell you everything you forgot," she said. "I know you. I know who you are."

Draco felt a burst of hope in his chest even though part of him recognize that this woman couldn't be trusted. "Who am I?"

"Tell me what you're working on," said Bellatrix.

"I don't know," he protested.

She scoffed and pulled a journal out of her robes. His journal.

"It won't open for me," she said. "It must be charmed to respond to you only. Won't you tell your favorite aunt what's inside?"

Draco leaned his head back against the wall. "It has instructions."

"Yes," said Bellatrix, eagerly. "What instructions?"

"It says I'm not safe. It says there are people who are after me. It says I'm in danger." Draco tipped his head down to look at the woman. "You're the danger, aren't you?"

She laughed, a forced, light-hearted sounded. "Why, my dear nephew, whatever would make you say that?"

"You did just kidnap me," Draco pointed out. "You tortured me."

Her eyes glittered in dark amusement. "Torture? That? A little bit of a crucio spell?" She laughed again, but this one was genuine. "I haven't begun to torture you. Up until now, I've been kind. Gentle, even. I have given you a chance to co-operate with me. Tell me what I want to know. What have you been working on?"

Draco sucked in a breath. He didn't know what he was working on. He knew it was a code of sorts, a language, maybe. He knew he could tell her that, spare himself some pain, but it was very clear she was the villain in this story. He didn't know what the story was – or what his part was in it – but he knew he couldn't tell her.

He shook his head. "No."

Her lips slowly spread into a cruel smile. "Oh, Draco, I was almost hoping you'd say that. You see, I have a favor to return to you. It's my turn in our game of pain." She leaned in, her hands reaching out to his neck. Draco grabbed her forearms, not pushing her away, because he knew it'd be pointless, but keeping her at as much of a distance as he could. "You nearly killed me once."

Draco blinked a little, not quite sure what to say to that. He'd tried to kill her? Why? What had been the circumstances? What had she done?

Or had he made erroneous assumptions? Was he the bad guy?

"Before you tried to kill me, you tortured me," she said. "You broke my bones. You tore off my fingernails. You turned my blood into crystals while it still flowed through my veins."

Draco stared at her, horrified. He shook his head, because it wasn't possible. She just laughed. "Oh, little Draco. I'm going to have fun with you." She pressed the stick against his shoulder. "Ignatius."

It felt as if she had driven a knife into his shoulder. Draco yelled. He tried to push her away, tried to squirm away from the wand, but she kept it digging into his skin, the spell or magic or whatever it was piercing far deeper, almost through bone. And then it seemed to spread, traveling through his veins like acid.

His shout became a scream. His struggle became writhing. His body rocked back, his head snapping into the wall, and then she finally pulled her wand away.

Draco slumped back, slipping down the wall to collapse on the ground. His hand automatically went to his shoulder and he felt blood, hot and wet, flowing from the wound. He pressed his palm tighter to his shoulder, gritting his teeth against the pain.

"Feel like talking now?" Bellatrix asked. She rose to tower over him. Her eyes watched him dispassionately, the way someone might study a fly missing a wing.

Draco tried pushing himself up. She stepped on him – just like someone might step on a fly missing a wing – right over his shoulder. He strangled on the next scream.

She held the journal up over him. "Well?"

She dropped it down, more like tossed it down on his chest. It hit, and bounced just a little. Draco could see where it has already picked up his blood on the back cover. It settled on his chest, and then suddenly seemed to take on a glow.

"No!" Bellatrix shouted.

He could see her wave her wand, but a bright, white light shot out of the journal and enveloped Draco. He had just enough time to think 'What now?' and then it felt as if he was being hooked behind his naval and tugged – and suddenly the room was disappearing around him. He understood that somehow the journal was magic too. And it was rescuing him.

OoOoOoOoO

Present day…

Draco considered the photo in his hands, the one he had pulled from the sock drawer. His parents stared out at him, dressed in their wedding clothes. Something told him that what he was about to do was going to open Pandora's box, that once he took this next step, he was going to come face-to-face with the dark secret of his family life that everyone seemed to be trying to hide from him.

He let out a breath and flopped back onto his bed. The door to his bedroom opened.

"You lied at dinner," Ginny said.

He heard her come in, but couldn't see her from this angle. He stared up at the ceiling as she climbed up on the bed next to him.

"I told the truth," Draco said.

"You said Percy didn't say much when you visited him," Ginny said.

That's what Draco had told the Order over dinner. There had been some eye-rolling and some scathing comments had been whispered under their breaths. Part of Draco wanted to tell them about Percy, specifically his blindness, because it seemed to him that everyone was operating under miscommunications and half-assed assumptions, and frankly, that level of miscommunication was disconcerting. There was a war on. There wasn't room for that sort of drama. But Draco had said nothing. He'd just asked Ginny to stop by later.

Draco turned his head and looked at her. She was fresh from a shower, hair wet and braided back, skin still pink and smelling of flowers and spice. "He didn't say much, but what he did say was pretty interesting."

Ginny raised her eyebrows.

"Percy told me you could contact my father."

Ginny paused. "Did he now?"

"Seemed to imply that you've done it before. Have you?"

Ginny let out a bit of a sigh, but then pulled a necklace out from underneath the t-shirt she wore. "Your father gave me this one Christmas. It's a ward of sorts. I've been successful in reaching him before."

"Even though he's dead?"

"He's not entirely dead," said Ginny.

Draco laughed, a line from a movie coming to the forefront of his mind. "Mostly dead." She didn't get the reference. That was okay. Draco rolled up to a sitting position. "Percy said I should talk to my father. What do you think?"

"It makes sense," Ginny allowed, without hesitating at all. "I had been hoping though… I had hoped your memories wouldn't be with Lucius."

Draco frowned. "Is he that bad?"

"He loves you," Ginny said. "Or rather… he comes close to loving you. That is… your relationship is hard to explain."

"So I gather," Draco said, rather dryly.

Ginny made a bit of a face in her frustration. "I saw you two go at it one time. It was right after you found out… well, suffice it to say, you were angry at him. We had dinner, all of us together, and you and your father spent the entire meal trying to hurt each other with nothing more than insults and well-placed threats."

Draco made a face. "Doesn't sound healthy."

"Definitely not," Ginny agreed. "But at the same time, as it was happening, all I could think was… if you're trying so desperately to prove you have the power to hurt each other, then there must be a layer of genuine affection for each other."

"That's looing at things rather nicely," said Draco.

Ginny reached out and caught his hands. "I don't think it's a bad idea to contact Lucius. I do think the Order will be worried, and concerned. Maybe overly worried and concerned. We might want to ask forgiveness and skip over permission."

Draco raised his eyebrows. "Keeping it a secret, huh?"

"We'll tell Bill. He should be there."

Draco nodded. "What you think is best."

"I think you're the best," said Ginny, and she leaned in and pressed a kiss against his lips.

Draco returned it, eagerly, but she pulled away shortly after. As much as she had reassured him that she didn't feel it was cheating on him to kiss him, he couldn't help but notice that physical contact was kept relatively chaste. He didn't know if that was because their relationship hadn't progress that far, if wizards had conservative morals, or if she really was uncomfortable with him.

She went back to her room and Draco lay back on his bed and turned the photo over once more in his hands. Another night of mystery, and perhaps in the morning, he'd be told where his memories were.

He wondered, just for a moment as he slipped into slumber, if he might be better off not remembering. He dreamed of pain in his shoulder, and dark laughter above him. He woke, groggy and confused, with sunlight just beginning to slip through the curtains. There was the faintest of buzzes occurring in steady intervals beyond his door. That was what had woken him up.

Draco rolled out of bed and stumbled into the shower. The buzzing was all that got through the charmed dampeners on the room. The emergency beacon was going off, calling out members of the Strike Team. There was an attack somewhere in London.

And Draco was useless the way he was.

He was going to have to get his memories back – even if he was going to uncover unpleasant ones.

Still, he was preoccupied with thoughts of just how horrible his memories might be. What had he seen? Who had he been? What had he done? He knew he was not a true hero, like Harry Potter. If anything, he was more the anti-hero. He understood that he'd been cold and aloof and not entirely kind. What sort of person would he become? Or rather, re-become?

The buzzing had stopped by the time he exited the shower. He dressed and headed down to the dining room that doubled as the Order briefing room. Bill was there, listening to the radio, his breakfast pushed to the side.

"Everything alright?" Draco asked.

Bill sighed. "Everything's pretty much over now. The London train was attacked. The Death Eaters were going after property damage and the transit lines more than they were interested in fighting. The Strike Teams will help with clean up."

There had been a lot of those attacks recently. The Death Eaters had gotten good at inflicting damage and then fleeing the scene. The financial toll they were taking on the country was an effective offense, and it occurred with little cost to themselves.

Draco exchanged a look with Bill and then diverted for the buffet table. The serving dishes were charmed to keep the food warm. It appeared, by the amount of food left, that not all Strike Team Members had managed to eat before being called out. He dished out a plate of eggs and toast and then went to sit by Bill.

"I may have lied to you the other day," he said.

Bill turned to him, not looking surprised at all. "I'm impressed that you're telling me so quickly."

"So I lie a lot," Draco surmised.

"You're… secretive," said Bill.

"Manipulative?" Draco asked.

"Sometimes. What did you lie about this time?"

"Meeting Percy. He had an idea."

Now Bill looked surprised. "Percy?"

"You do know he's quite smart, don't you?" Draco asked, just checking.

"Percy's intelligent," Bill said, like he was differentiating between something.

Draco let out an irritated breath of air. "Well, anyway, your intelligent brother suggested I talk to my father."

Bill balked a little. "Lucius?"

"What do you think?" Draco asked.

Several expressions crossed Bill's face. Draco was able to read most of them. There was an immediate reaction of aversion, then concern. Then something that Draco couldn't quite read, and then Bill's expression settled into reluctant consideration.

"I see you already told him," Ginny said, coming into the room. She immediately walked to the coffee pot and poured herself a mug. She joined them at the table.

"How did he suggest we find Lucius?" Bill asked.

Draco turned to Ginny. She gave her older brother an apologetic look. "I may be able to contact Lucius."

Bill's eyebrows rose. "I know he rescued you five years ago, but… you can still contact him?"

Ginny nodded. "I called him, a year ago, when we thought Percy was in trouble at the Ministry."

"You – what?" Bill asked. He obviously hadn't known about this.

Ginny shrugged. "Apparently it wasn't necessary. But he still came."

Draco bit back the impulse to say that, as Percy had ended up blind, it might have been very necessary indeed. But it wasn't his place to say anything, so he redirected to the logistics of calling his father. "Should we call now?"

Bill sighed. "Let me finished breakfast first. Then we'll meet in… well, I guess the best place would be the master study. Say, ten o'clock?"

Draco nodded. It actually wouldn't hurt to have some time to prepare. He wasn't quite sure what to say to his father. Hello, perhaps? Sorry to hear you died?

The questions distracted him throughout breakfast, even as the Strike Team returned, smelling of smoke and a little ashy, but overall in good health. Draco excused himself soon after and made his way straight to the master study. He had searched through the room back when they still thought his memories were hidden in the Manor. He'd been told it was Lucius's study, and that it'd been kept the same.

He took a turn about the room now, eyes flicking to the décor and knickknacks that were displayed about the room. He tried to imagine why each piece had been gathered, and tried to draw deductions about the sort of man who would collect the pieces. He had no luck. He slumped into a chair and tried brooding for a few moments. Restlessness got him back up to his feet. He browsed the bookshelves and pulled down a couple of tomes. He flipped through the pages, but his mind was to busy for him to retain any of the information. He gave up and stalked to the window. His fingers tapped together, a nervous sort of habit, his thumb touching first his index finger, then the ring finger, then the middle and pinky.

Ginny and Bill came in together. They were early. It was only quarter of ten. No one said anything at first. Draco bounced a little on his feet, and then turned to Ginny. "Do it."

She pulled the necklace out from under his shirt and closed her hand around it. She closed her eyes. Her lips moved silently.

Draco braced himself.

Nothing happened.

Ginny opened her eyes, glanced around, and then shrugged. "Sometimes it takes a while."

Draco let out a breath. He turned to the window, his fingers still tapping. He could hear Bill and Ginny conversing quietly behind him. He didn't bother listening in, just scanned the landscape outside, wanting something to distract him, wanting something to –

"Really, Miss Weasley," proclaimed a low, droll voice, "you are obviously in no danger."

Draco whipped around.

Lucius Malfoy was standing profile to him, facing Ginny. He looked like his pictures. White-blond hair, perfectly brushed, cascading to his shoulders. Fair skin, high forehead, sharp nose. His eyes were the color of steel. His robes were deep green and he carried a silver cane. His face was composed with only the faintest hints of condescension on his features.

Ginny turned towards Draco, and Lucius followed her gaze. His cold eyes latched onto Draco and he paused. There was something uncomfortable about Lucius's gaze, something that made Draco feel like he was completely exposed, completely vulnerable. He shifted on his feet, not knowing what to do or say, but wanting to make a good impression. And then he inwardly said, 'fuck it.'

"Hey, dad," he said, outright and blunt.

He immediately knew it was the wrong thing to say. Lucius didn't recoil, not outright, but something shuttered in his expression and his cold gaze seemed to grow even frostier.

"So… we're not on that level," Draco said, refusing to feel awkward, refusing to feel ashamed, refusing to feel anything because –

Well, because he'd been told Lucius was an asshole – granted, not in so many words – but he refused to feel as if he was somehow less than his father, refused to feel like he was trying to impress his father. Even though he desperately wanted his father to like him. To love him.

"Mon dieu," Lucius said, his voice flat. He strode towards Draco, his steps quick and purposeful, and Draco instinctively took one step backwards, but that was all he managed before Lucius was in front of him.

His father reached out. His hand grabbed his chin, and Draco wanted to lash out, or step back, or get him off, but suddenly he was frozen. And then his eyes were right there, burning into him. Draco saw nothing reflected in Lucius' eyes, and he wondered if he'd ever been able to read his father's eyes, wondered if it was even possible to read that blank mask.

"Dragon," said Lucius – and Draco knew that wasn't his name. He wondered if that was in nickname, or an insult, or a term of endearment. He wasn't sure.

"What have you done to yourself?" Lucius asked. It wasn't a question, not really, more of a rhetorical question, or an idle statement.

"Wiped my memories," Draco answered, honestly and truthfully. "I don't remember you."

The grip on his chin loosed a bit, and then Lucius reached up and brushed the side of his face. "I hardly recognize you." Lucius stepped back. There was a slight softening to his features. "You've been gone for some time. Rumor had it that Bellatrix killed you."

Draco's hand went to his shoulder. Lucius tracked the motion. "Not quite," Draco said.

Lucius's gaze sharpened. "I see."

His voice hadn't changed inflection, but Draco suddenly felt a little nervous. Lucius was dangerous, he knew that much.

"And what made you take such drastic measures as wiping your own memories?" Lucius asked. His voice arched, ever so slightly.

"I translated the - ," Draco stopped, because Bill was shaking his head behind Lucius.

Lucius followed his gaze and smirked a little. "You were saying?" he prompted.

Draco hesitated. Lucius's mouth tightened. "You'd keep secrets from your own father, Draco?" His voice dropped a little lower.

"I don't know you," Draco said, a little bit lamely.

Lucius stepped forward, crowding his space. "Then why have you called me?"

Draco tried not to edge backwards, but it was hard not to fold under Lucius's intense gaze. "I can't find my memories."

Lucius smiled, a predatory sort of grin. "You don't know yourself, that was why you called me. You thought I would know."

"Is there a place he visited often as a child?" Bill asked, cutting in. There was a sharpness to his tone that said he wasn't pleased with Lucius's presence.

Lucius didn't even glance towards Bill. He kept his gaze on Draco. "Your brother's grave held special meaning to you."

"Brother?" Draco asked.

Lucius let out a silent breath. "How much you've lost." He reached out again and let his hand drop on Draco's head. "This is who you would be without me." He laughed a little, but there was no amusement in it. "So… careless."

"Excuse me?" Draco demanded.

Lucius laughed again and stepped back. "So ardent." And then he turned away and looked back at the others. "You were right to call. Visit his brother's grave. He might have stored them there. Now, if that were the only crisis I was called to deal with today, I do have other plans."

He swept up his robes, like he intended to leave, and Draco realized he had been dismissed. No, worse than dismissed. He'd been uninteresting.

"What if they're not there?" he demanded.

Lucius looked back at him, one eyebrow quirked, as if he hadn't quite heard Draco.

Draco glared. He knew Lucius had heard him. "What if my memories aren't there?" he repeated. "Then what?"

"You prided yourself on being a genius," said Lucius. "I'm sure you'll figure it out."

Draco was being dismissed again. To hell with subtle.

"So that's it?" Draco asked, raising his arms a little. "A quick hello, hey visit your dead brother, and then you're on your way?"

Lucius turned back to him. "You're not my son." Draco felt anger spark, but Lucius continued before he could interject. "You have no memory of me. I do not recognize you. What were you expecting? A family reunion?"

Hurt struck Draco deep. He responded by striking at a target he hypothesized would be the best to hit. "For a family reunion, Narcissa would have to be here, wouldn't she? Maybe if you're out of ideas, I could ask her."

Lucius was suddenly in front of him again, and his finger was pressing into his chest. "Do not," Lucius snarled. "You will not visit that woman." Lucius turned towards Bill, still keeping his finger prodding into Draco's sternum. "You told me you would keep him safe."

Safe? Why would his mother be unsafe?

"I have," said Bill. "As much as it was possible."

"Continue to do so," Lucius commanded. He turned back to Draco, his gaze re-assessing. "Narcissa cannot give you anything you need." He drew back, straightening his robes. "You will inform me when you are yourself again."

It was commanding and presumptuous. Draco held his gaze, not ready to promise anything. Lucius gave the slightest of smiles, and then he seemed to melt out of the air and vanished.

Draco blinked at the abruptness of his exit.

"He does that," Ginny said.

Draco let out a breath. He scrubbed a hand over his face. "Is that… is that him?"

Of course he knew it was Lucius Malfoy. He just needed to know if that was how he always behaved.

"That's him," Bill said.

"How did it go?" Draco asked, because he honestly wasn't sure.

"I think about as well as it always does," said Ginny. "He always seems to win, but you manage to hold your own."

"And my brother's grave?"

"In France," said Bill.

Draco groaned, because of course it was. It meant a delay as they waited for travel papers.

"I'll put in the request for our trip," said Bill.

He left and Draco dropped into a chair. He felt oddly drained. Ginny came over to perch on the arm of the chair.

"I grew up with that?" Draco asked.

She hummed a little. "Gives you a little bit of insight, doesn't it?"

Draco felt he could have done without the insight.

OoOoOoOo

Bill sat in the green parlor, a glass of Scotch in hand. The green parlor was a small room, tucked away on the first floor, right across the hall from the stairs to the dungeons. It was a comfortable room, full of mismatched furniture that looked like it had been moved out of sight after falling out of fashion. He and Snape retired there when they needed to vent about the aggravations of running a vigilante organization in the middle of a civil war. There was an unspoken agreement that when the light was on, signaling one of them was inside, the other had to attend.

He sipped the Scotch, made a face, and took another sip.

"Drinking it more won't make you like it," said Snape, coming into the room. He smelled of smoke, incense, and something unpleasantly acrid. His fingers were stained blue with whatever potion he'd been brewing.

Severus poured himself some of the same drink. They were gradually sipping their way through all of the offerings of the Malfoy liquor cabinet. They weren't even halfway through yet. Bill watched as Severus sampled a taste. As a Potion's Master, Severus had a well-developed palate and he appreciated a wider range of beverages than Bill did.

Severus made a thoughtful noise and then took his usual seat in the armchair next to Bill. "What brings you to the sweat and tears room today?"

"Well, we called Lucius," Bill admitted.

Severus took a slow sip of Scotch. "I suppose it was unavoidable. How is Lucius these days?"

"Remarkably the same for a dead man," said Bill.

"And Draco?"

"Fared rather well."

"Lucius does tend to pull his punches with Draco."

"Draco mentioned Narcissa."

Severus winced.

"Lucius seemed more worried than irritated," Bill said.

"He must recognize Draco isn't himself."

"He said Draco wasn't his son."

Severus dropped his head into his hand. "I have worked as a Potion's Master for over two decades now, but I swear, it is the Malfoys and their family drama that will give me my first gray hair."

"They are remarkably dramatic for a family that eschews most emotions, aren't they?" Bill mused. He took a larger sip of Scotch. He still didn't like it, but at least he was getting a warm feeling in his stomach.

"I hope you at least got a viable suggestion from him," Snape said.

"Lucius suggested Lukas's grave."

Severus nodded. "Seems possible. Did you request international travel?"

"Just sent in the paperwork," Bill said. He took one more gulp and then blurted out the question he'd been wondering for a while now. "Do you think Draco would be better off if he didn't get his memories back?"

"Ah," said Severus. "The great philosophical debate. Is it better to be ignorant and blissful, or wise and miserable?"

"I wouldn't say miserable," said Bill, "but otherwise, yes. That's my question. He's so… ,"

"Vibrant," Severus provided. "Without the rigors of his Pureblood upbringing, he doesn't stifle himself. But does that equate happiness?"

"It might be healthier," said Bill.

"It probably is healthier," Severus said. "But if now the question is health, can he truly be healthy without any founding memories?"

"He's in for a world of pain when he gets his memories back," Bill said. "I know his childhood was difficult, and I know there is more he hasn't told me, and is it wrong to want to spare him that?"

"Of course not."

"He is happier without that past. I know he is."

"But what past do you leave him with?" Severus countered. "His earliest memory now is waking up in a random city, not knowing who he is or if he has a home. His past is now confusion, fear, and loneliness. Of constant danger and vigilance. Terror, even."

Bill thought back to when he'd first found Draco. The gun that Draco had on him. The locks on the door. The fear in his eyes.

"His childhood was not ideal," Severus continued, "but he knew who he was. And he knew he had a home. And as much as Lucius was not the best father, he did care for Draco. Would you deny him that piece of happiness that he does have?"

Bill sighed. "No. I wouldn't."

"And you are forgetting the most important piece of this question," said Severus.

Bill turned to him.

"Draco himself," said Severus. "He's been frustrated with the search for his memories, yes. He's been irritated and restless, but he hasn't stopped yet. He knows what he is missing, and he wants to reclaim that piece, the good and the bad. Trust him. If he doubts, we will listen. Until then, we follow his lead."

Bill let his words sink in. There was truth in them, that he knew. He raised his glass in Severus's direction. "You're a smart man, Severus."

Severus clinked his glass against Bill's. "If I was smart, I would have moved away from this whole mess."

Bill laughed and downed the rest of the Scotch.

OoOoOoOo

Yay! Thanks for reading. Please leave a review!





14. Another Side to the Story

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. Alas.

OoOoOoOoO

Five years ago…

Draco stared at the house. He tried to make sense of it, but it was so outside of his realm of expectations that he couldn't quite grasp the reality of the situation.

Desperation had brought him here. That was the only reason he had come. He needed as a safe place to store his memories – a place no one would think of – a place so obviously wrong no one would suspect it. Not even the Dark Lord.

No one would suspect him to leave his memories with Sam and Laney. Doing so would endanger his sister-in-law and his niece. But if Draco decided to use that assumption in his favor, and choose to hide his memories with them, well… he'd be doing exactly what he didn't want to do in the first place. So they were out.

But there was another wrong choice he could use to his favor. There was another place he could hide his memories that no one would expect. And he was here now.

Draco had planned on leaving his memories somewhere in the property of the house, somewhere out of sight, somewhere no one would notice, even if the house changed hands in between now and whenever it was he made it back to retrieve his memories. He planned on being quick about it too.

But this house wasn't what he expected, and it caused him to pause. He tried to make sense of it.

The front door opened. A figure appeared. "Draco?"

oOoOoOoOo

Present day...

Draco sighed and let the letter drop onto the table. Bill reached over and snagged it up, even though Draco had just read the contents out loud to the Order members who were at the breakfast table.

The letter had been addressed to him. It'd come from Percy. Apparently Percy and his family were at such odds that even important Order information had to go through a neutral party, and couldn't go straight to the Weasleys. And Draco apparently was that neutral party.

Although, in Percy's defense, the letter concerned Draco's family, so he supposed he couldn't get too irritated at the family dynamics.

"Your memories could still be there," said Ginny. She was seated next to Draco and she reached out to put a hand on his. "You would have hid your memories well, maybe even spelled them to be invisible except in your presence."

"Percy says the reports of the damage to the cemetery is extensive," Bill said, as if Draco hadn't just read the entire letter verbatim. "Even if we do get travel papers, the cemetery will be under a state of repair for a while."

"So we sneak in," said Ron, around a mouthful of eggs. "Wouldn't be the hardest thing we've broken into."

"It does suggest a few other tidbits of information," Severus said. He was leaned back in his chair, a cup of tea in his hands. Those gathered at the table turned to look at him. "One, the Death Eaters are aware that Draco is without his memories. Two, that they are searching anywhere remotely connected to Draco to find his memories first, and three, it is unlikely that Draco left his memories at Lukas's grave."

"How did you jump to that conclusion?" Arthur asked.

"If I'm such a genius, I wouldn't have left my memories anywhere the Death Eaters might think of," Draco said, chiming in for Severus. "I would have left them at a place the Death Eaters would never suspect."

"So, where does that leave us?" Hermione asked.

Silence followed her question.

"I guess we need to out-genius Draco," said Bill finally. He gave a smile, like he was making a joke, but it seemed to fall flat.

Draco sighed and pushed his plate away. He wasn't hungry anymore. He left the dining room, hearing Bill call after him, but he didn't stop. He was sick of all the dead-ends. He was sick of the mystery.

Draco went back to his room and locked the door behind him. He wanted to be alone. He wanted to be miserable. He pulled the photo out of his sock drawer and flopped onto his bed in a huff.

He stared at the photo. In the picture, Lucius's lips tugged up, smugly satisfied as he gazed at his wife. Narcissa dropped her gaze from her newly wedded husband and seemed to take in a bracing breath.

"You look like the asshole I met the other day," Draco informed photo-Lucius. He turned his gaze onto his mother. "You don't look so bad. I don't see what the problem is. Not that I don't trust everyone. They all say you're trouble. It's just… well, if I knew where you were I could see for myself, couldn't I? I could see what all the fuss is about."

A thought struck him suddenly. He sat up and fumbled with the photo, removing the backing from the frame. He pulled the picture out from underneath the glass and then flipped it over.

There, on the back of the photo, an address was written in a neat cursive hand. Draco knew that writing. It was his own.

The address was paired with instructions. 'Hold the photograph. Speak the address aloud.'

Draco sprang off his bed. He grabbed a jacket and stuffed his feet into his shoes. He slipped his wand into his jeans pocket and then paused a moment. There was a strange fluttering in his chest. He was about to meet his mother. He ducked into the bathroom to brush his teeth. A glance at himself in the mirror made him reach for his comb and run it through his hair. And then he glanced down at his clothes. Jeans. A t-shirt. A jacket. Was that okay? Should he wear something more formal?

"She's bad news," Draco said aloud, trying to remind himself. "She's unsafe. She's…,"

But he didn't know what else she was. He didn't know by what criteria was a being judged.

"Merde," Draco swore.

He walked back out into the bedroom and picked up the photograph.

"Blossom House. The Cotswolds, England."

The familiar yank of a portkey seized him. The room blurred then disappeared and then he was spat outside onto a neatly trimmed front yard. He nearly kept his balance, but ultimately failed. He blamed the vertigo that followed from the jolt.

He pushed himself back up and looked around him. The day was warm. The sky was partially covered with thick white clouds. There was a steady, light breeze that brushed through the trees, but other than the wind and the faint birdsong, it was silent. Peaceful.

This was not what he had been expecting.

Granted, he wasn't quite sure what he'd been expecting, but he knew this wasn't it.

The house in front of him looked like a cottage. A very large cottage. Three stories, lots of paned windows, all warmly lit with lanterns, and a front garden so massive, it was spilling out into the well-groomed front lawn. All the plants appeared to be blooming. Several pink, several purple, but the majority were blue. Draco wondered if it was her favorite color.

The front walk was a series of flat paving stones. Draco cautiously stepped up them to the front porch, a spacious area with two wooden rocking chairs, covered in pillows and blankets. Three planters hung from the rafters. A few butterflies flitted around the plants. A wind-chime tinkered in the breeze.

Draco reached out to the door-knocker and tapped it against the metal plate on the door. The door-knocker set off a series of musical chimes. Draco waited, feeling his breath catch slightly in anticipation. He patted his jeans pocket, just to be sure his wand was there, just in case she turned out as bad as he'd been told.

Form inside, he could hear light footsteps hurrying towards the door. He braced himself, and then the door was pulled open.

Narcissa Malfoy was nothing like he'd feared.

The way she had been described, the way she had been talked about, Draco had been expecting someone evil-looking. Someone sculpted, frigid, aloof. Perhaps covered in jewels with a cruel smile on her lips. Perhaps with heavy brows, red lips, and revealing clothing.

In contrast with his expectations, Narcissa was dressed in a pale blue, tea-length dress. Her hair was pale blonde, cascading down her back in gentle curls. She wore minimal make-up, just a brush of mascara over her long eyelashes and a hint of lipstick. She looked soft, approachable, and kind.

Draco sucked in a breath. She was beautiful.

She was also sick.

Draco could see that in the almost-translucent quality to her skin, the pallor of her cheeks, and the way she was breathing heavy, as if she'd lost her breath running for the door.

"Draco," she said, voice more of a gasp. She reached out to him, a faint tremor in her hand.

"Hello," said Draco. And reached back.

Her hands clasped his, and then she pulled him forward, up a step into the house, and into her embrace. She gripped him tight. "Oh, my baby."

Her arms were weak, but that didn't mean Draco didn't relish the feeling of being held close. He squeezed back, gently, and could feel her tremble in his arms.

She was definitely unwell.

Draco pulled back, wanting to ask what was wrong, but she only smiled at him. "Look at you! You've gotten so big, so handsome!" She reached out to pat his cheek and Draco felt his cheeks heat up. Her smile faded, just a little bit. "And, of course, you don't remember me."

Draco shook his head. "I'm sorry."

"No," she said, giving a small smile. "Don't be sorry. Come in, I'll make you a cup of tea."

She led him into the house and sat him in the parlor while she put the kettle on, but Draco wasn't content just sitting. Not when he'd been told his mother was dangerous. Not when he was witnessing the exact opposite. Not when he was in her house and it appeared to be some sort of fairy's adobe. Everywhere he looked there were flowers. And where there weren't real flowers, there were floral wallpapers, floral patterned curtains, and floral paintings.

It should have looked terrible. It should have looked like some crazed grandmother's house with all the contrasting patterns and colors, but it all worked together impossible well. The colors all complimented each other. The patterns were varied in sizes, subtleties, and styles in a way that enhanced the house around him.

And there were still so many paintings. Paintings of flowers. Paintings of people. Paintings of landscapes. Even a few abstract paintings.

Draco found Narcissa's studio upstairs. It was a large room with hardwood floors and tall windows that let in great swaths of natural light. There were more paintings in various states of completion here. Some were drying, some were half-painted, and some were only sketched out.

Narcissa found him there, glancing through a stack of finished landscapes. She handed him a cup of tea and then wrapped both hands around her own, like she was soaking in the heat.

Draco gestured around the room. "You paint. Really well."

"Thank you. It's something I've been rediscovering." She motioned for him to follow her over to the corner of the room. An armchair was placed there, an easel beside it, as if she sometimes painted while seated. Draco snagged the cushioned ottoman. Narcissa sank into the armchair looking weary and pinched around her eyes.

"You're sick," Draco said.

"Yes," she said. She pressed a hand against her temple. "It was to be expected, really."

Draco didn't know what she meant by that. He wanted to ask, but he knew there were more pressing questions. He leaned forward. "Do you know where my memories are?"

Narcissa nodded. "You left them here."

Draco made to get up. "Where?"

She reached out and pressed a hand on his knee. He paused.

"I'll give them to you," she promised. "But first…," she paused. She looked away from him, breath catching. "Let me tell you a story."

"I don't know how much time I have before they realize I'm gone," Draco said. "They weren't thrilled about me coming here. And I don't know how long the memories will take to go back into my head. Can it wait until after?"

She shook her head. "You won't listen to me when you get your memories back. You won't… you're going to hate me, and right now, this is the only chance I have to tell you about your family."

Draco sat back down onto the ottoman. He rubbed a hand through his hair, uncertain.

"You promised me you would listen when you left your memories here," Narcissa said.

"I did?"

She nodded. "You said it would be the only time you'd be willing to listen. So, will you?"

"I guess it's only fair if I do," said Draco.

She gave a forced sort of smile. "Thank you." She took in a breath. "I've been thinking about what to tell you for years now. When I knew you were coming back to retrieve your memories, I knew I'd get a chance to explain some things. About me. About your father. In all honesty, it helped me work through some things as well, realize where I went wrong.

"The first thing I wanted to tell you is that I've never been a strong person. I never had to be. As a child, I was privileged, spoiled, and sheltered. I didn't have to think about money. I didn't have to think about providing for myself. My parents were very wealthy, very powerful, and as such, I had everything I could ever want. It was a charmed life, a happy life.

"Before I went off to school, my parents made sure to educate me. Mathematics, science, magic, history, languages, and the arts. How I loved the arts. Music, dance, literature, poetry, and most of all, painting. You must have guessed that." Narcissa gestured out at the room around her. "Both my sisters were louder than me, more energetic, more… vital, I suppose. They saw the injustices of the world and wanted to change them – each in opposite ways. Andromeda aligned herself with the Muggle-born. Bellatrix went down the darker path."

Draco couldn't help but flinch a little at her name. Narcissa gave an apologetic wince.

"I didn't understand my sisters, not really, and they didn't understand me, because when I saw the world, I didn't see injustices. I didn't see opportunities to gain power. When I saw the world though, oh, I saw such wonderful things. Flowers. Animals. The ocean. The sky. The people. I saw colors and textures and beauty. I begged my parents to send me to Beauxbaton. They had such a good art program there, but they were insistent that Hogwarts was the place for me. They thought it would get my head out of the clouds, and ground me in reality.

"I suppose was happy enough there. There's beauty to be found anywhere, and Hogwarts was an impressive school. And then there was your father."

Narcissa looked at Draco. "He was the handsomest boy in school and the most popular. He came from a rich and powerful family. He was very smart and athletic and extremely charismatic.

"He was a year old than me, and took no real notice of me until my fifth year. He found me painting in the courtyard and seemed impressed at my artistic talent. He was even more impressed at my memory. I've always had a good eye for detail, and I only need to see something once to remember it.

"Even more, I think he was interested in the way I saw the world. The beauty in it. I could see sun when others only saw rain. I think it captivated him because there wasn't much beauty in his own world. He lived a cold, lonely, and stark existence, and he craved as much beauty as he could get."

Narcissa glanced down. "I fell in love with him. Truly I did, but I was also afraid of him. He had such intensity about him that sometimes it felt like he was suffocating me. And he was so much smarter than anyone I'd ever met, so much smarter than me, that he could make me question the color of the sky. He had a way of twisting words, of twisting logic, that he could always get what he wanted, and he always seemed to end up on top.

"He decided that he wanted me for his wife. He pursued me for several years after school. His attentions were flattering. His words were kind. And just as I loved him, he did care for me. But it wasn't the true kind of affection. Although he craved love, he didn't want the true kind of love. He wanted the selfish type. He wanted adoration and devotion.

"And as Lucius kept pursuing me, my family kept pressuring me as well. They knew what a marriage to a Malfoy would mean for the family. They wouldn't let me say no. And with their insistence, and with Lucius's way with words, I found myself becoming convinced with their arguments. I thought my initial denials were stupid. Here was a rich, handsome, intelligent man, a man I did love, who wanted my hand in marriage. What was so wrong with that? It was a fairy-tale come true. And so we were wed. And for a while, it was good."

Narcissa licked her lips. She took a sip of tea and Draco found himself leaning in, waiting for the next piece of the story.

"But Lucius kept needing more. More love. More attention. More adulation. And he also needed more power. He joined the Dark Lord and his mob, and he turned dark, so dark even I couldn't find any beauty in it. It terrified me. The horrors he was taking a part of, the death and destruction. The bigotry and hate. It was ugly."

Narcissa's hands tightened around her cup. "Lucius hated to see me upset, but he wouldn't stop his dealings with the Death Eaters. He took me to the Healers, convinced I was having a mild fit of hysterics or depression. And the Healers were used to treating rich clients who only wanted results without putting in any work or making any changes to their lifestyle. They gave me cheering charms and told me to take them every day, so I did. And the beauty came back and my happiness came back, but cheering charms aren't a permanent fix. So the Healers gave me more potions, mood-lifters, sedatives, even love potions.

"A strange sort of apathy took hold of me. I was happy, but I didn't care about painting anymore. I didn't bother listening to music. I walked around the house, smiling and giggling and empty. It was only with the potions that I could live with Lucius, and the way he seemed to suck all the happiness and joy out of me. And finally I could stomach the Death Eater meetings, and the ugliness of the world, and so I kept taking them. And then it was easy to make the jump to illegal drugs.

"Lucius quickly realize it was spiraling into an addiction. He got me clean for a few weeks, and I looked around at the world, and I realized I didn't want to be in it. Not without the drugs. But I knew the only way to get them back was to make Lucius hate me. So I had affairs. And dalliances. Public ones, meant to humiliate him, and I didn't care that I hurt him because he was slowly killing me."

Draco got up, not sure he was ready to hear all this. He paced to the window and looked out.

Narcissa continued, her voice taking on a choked quality, like she was trying not to cry. "But still Lucius wouldn't leave me alone. Still he wanted that devotion, and I had nothing left to give him except… except a child. So we conceived you. And I planned, I am so sorry to say this, but I had planned to have nothing to do with you. I even told Lucius that. I said, 'Take the baby when he comes, and leave me'."

Something panged in Draco's chest. It was suddenly hard to breathe. Is this what he'd been warned about?

"How I waited for the day of your birth. I saw it as a day of my rebirth. I'd been off the drugs while pregnant with you – Lucius wouldn't have it any other way. Without my mind muddled with substances, I had hope for the future again. I planned on buying a cottage and living on my own. I planned on growing a garden with all sorts of flowers. I planned on returning to my paints. And then you were born."

Draco looked over at her. She was crying now, tears spilling over her face. She reached a hand out to him, but Draco couldn't bring himself to reach back to her. He was horrified at what she was saying to him. Horrified at the history he was learning.

"Oh, Draco, you were so perfect," Narcissa said. "You had the biggest eyes. You had the most precious ears. Your nose was a cute little button, and I held you in my arms, and I thought, 'I can't give you up. He can't have you. He won't be able to love you, the way a parent needs to love a child.' But I knew he was coming in to take you.

"You were crying. Of course you were crying. You were a baby, barely hours old. I knew he could hear you crying, so I cast an anti-crying hex on you, just to spend a couple more minutes with you, but then he came. He took you away, and I thought it would be okay. He'd needed to bring you back to me so I could take the hex off. So I waited. I waited for a day, and then a week, and then two weeks. I bought this cottage, I planned on moving, and still, he didn't bring you back. And I thought, why wouldn't he bring you to me? Surely he must know it's not right for a child not to cry, surely he'll see there's something wrong, and I'll be able to hold you again. But Lucius didn't. And I didn't know if he was that inexperienced with children, or if… or if he wanted the perfect son. A son who would never shed a tear."

Draco reached up to his face. His eyes were stinging, but no tears fell. Even when he'd been at his loneliest on the run, he hadn't cried. He'd thought nothing of it at the time. He'd thought that perhaps he wasn't that lonely or that distraught, but now… now he knew differently.

Narcissa spoke again. "When I realized that I would most likely never see you again when I left Lucius, the grief came back. But I still planned on leaving. But Lucius couldn't quite let me go. He still wanted a wife, and a wife who had affairs was still better than a wife who divorced him. And I think… I think he still loved me in that selfish sort of way.

"He had the Healer pay me a visit, the same Healer that had offered me my first cheering potions. But this time he had something stronger. And I remember thinking, as I let him into my room, that I should have just shut the door in his face. I should have kept him out. And I was thinking, as I took the potion, that I might never find myself again. But I was also thinking, 'Just one more time. Just one more potion. I've just lost my baby, surely I deserve to have this one potion'."

Narcissa hunched in on herself. "And so I took the potion, because I've told you already, I'm not a strong person. I've always been like the flowers I grow. Delicate. Fragile. And so I took that potion, and I wasn't sober again for seventeen years.

"But perhaps I've told this story wrong. It was my choice to take the potions. It has always been my choice. And it was my choice to keep taking them, to keep numbing out my conscience instead of listening to it. Lucius just provided the opportunity to keep taking the easy way out."

Narcissa put her teacup down. "After he died, I realized there was no need to numb it out anymore. I could leave, retire to my cottage, and so I did. And so I've stayed here. Away from the world, and the ugliness, just as sheltered as when I was young."

She brushed the tears from her face. She pulled in a breath, steeling herself. She looked at him. "I've done terrible things to you Draco. Things you'll remember when you get your memories back. This isn't… this isn't an excuse. I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was weak. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry that everything has turned out this way. And I love you, Draco. I've never said it before, but I do. And that makes what I've done even more unforgiveable."

Draco didn't know what to say. He didn't even know what to do. She was apologizing for a past he couldn't remember. In this moment, he'd heard her story. Her heartache. Her failings. He felt for her, but something kept him from saying anything. By her own admission, she'd mistreated him. He couldn't offer absolution for crimes he didn't fully understand.

She didn't seem to expect an answer from him. She just stood, shaky and weak, and motioned for him to follow her. She led him across the hall to a small library and gestured for him to sit on the couch. Draco did, but his leg jounced up and down in nervous anticipation. She crossed over to a small writing desk and unlocked a side drawer. She reached inside and pulled out a wooden box. It was intricately carved with flowers and vines running along the top and the sides.

"The box will only open for you," she said. She handed it to him and then leaned down and pressed a kiss against his forehead. "You can let yourself out when you're ready. I won't be offended if you don't say goodbye."

She left the room, closing the door gently behind her. Draco stared at the box in his hands.

This, too, hadn't been what he expected. He thought maybe a crystal ball, glowing with magic. Or a pensieve, he'd read up on those. But this was just a box.

And it was also everything he'd been wanting for as long as he could remember – just a few short months, really, but to him, he'd been waiting his whole life. What would he remember? Who would he become?

He set the box down on the coffee table and swiped a hand over his face. Now that he was about to get his memories back, he felt almost afraid. Would he remember who he was now or would he lose that piece of himself?

He got up to pace about the room.

How many terrible memories would he have?

Would it even be better if he didn't open this box? A Pandora's box if ever there was one.

But just as soon as the doubts rose up, they subsided again.

Draco didn't know who he was without his past. There was a hole in his brain and Draco was sick of it. He wanted those memories back.

He strode over to the box and picked it up. The clasp was locked, but as soon as he brushed his fingers over it, the latch clicked open. Draco sucked in a breath, opened the lid, and peered inside.

Light shot out. But more than light. A jumble of sounds, sights, voices, tastes and smells, feelings and emotions rushed over him, and it was far too much. It was overwhelming. It was painful.

He was lost in an ocean, tossed about with random flecks of memories, and his head felt like it was going to explode.

Draco doubled over, the box dropping to the floor, his hands reaching up to clutch at his head. The pain spiked. Draco fell to the ground and screamed.

oOoOoOoOoOo

Bill knocked on Draco's door. "Hey, it's Bill." He paused and waited. "Draco, look, I know you're upset about the cemetery, but can we at least talk about it?"

There was no answer.

Bill frowned and tried to the door handle. It was locked. He sighed, pulled out his wand, and unlocked the door. He stepped through.

Draco wasn't there.

An empty picture frame was lying on his bed. Bill had a sinking feeling in his stomach.

oOoOoOoOoOo

Author's note: So... thoughts?





15. Remembering

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. Obviously.

OoOoOoOoO

Five years ago…

The woman who answered the door was Narcissa Malfoy, but it also wasn't. She looked horrible. Her face was pale, almost sheet white. Her hair was thin and flat. Her lips were nearly colorless.

But her eyes were clear.

Draco stared at her.

She licked her lips. "Would you like to come in?"

Her voice was trembling, weak. She stepped back to pull the door open a little bit further. She was wearing a pale pink dress. It looked soft. It was long sleeved and dropped past her knees. It wasn't revealing or seductive or downright indecent. It appeared to be two decades old. An old gown of hers, perhaps?

There were spots of color on the dress. A splatter of white, green, and yellow. Paint?

Draco was going to say no. He didn't know who this woman was, and he didn't really care to know, but the paint was a funny detail.

He strode silently into the house and then followed the lights further in. It was clear she had just moved in. There were boxes and trunks stacked along the walls. The walls were bare. The lights led to the kitchen even though it was past the dinner hour. Narcissa hadn't been eating though. There were no dishes, no food. There was an armchair however, and an artist's easel, and a half-finished landscape.

Draco walked closer because he recognized the garden that was being painted. It was the side garden at the manor, the one with the fountain surrounded by daffodils, blue bells, and peonies. And it appeared his mother was capturing every single flower, and even though he didn't care to remember every flower, he had a feeling that this painting was accurate down to the very last petal.

Something clicked into place for him. He wouldn't have had such a good memory if he didn't get it from both parents. He looked up at Narcissa, She was leaning against the doorway, looking somehow paler than before.

"You're ill," Draco said.

"You can hardly be surprised, all factors taken into consideration," said Narcissa.

She moved towards the chair, and Draco stepped away, even though it looked like she might faint mid-way there. He wasn't going to catch her. She made it to the chair though, and sat down heavily.

"I wasn't expecting this," Draco said.

"What made you come then? I know you didn't come to see me."

"I wanted to leave something here," said Draco. "Without your knowledge, of course. I need to leave for a while and have something that needs to remain hidden."

Narcissa smiled. "And this would be the last place anyone would look."

"Precisely," said Draco.

Narcissa glanced down and swallowed. "I know I don't have the right to ask, but I find I can't help it." She looked up. Her brows were furrowed. "Are you in trouble, Draco?"

For a moment, she sounded worried. For a moment, Draco understood what it was to be cared for by a mother. He immediately brushed the feeling away. "No more than usual."

"Draco," said Narcissa. She paused a moment before continuing. "I know you must be in dire trouble to come to me. Yet I find I am pleased at the news if it means I might be able to talk to you. Perhaps have a conversation? A chance to… well, not atone any of my wrongs, but at least -,"

"I don't want anything from you," Draco said, cutting her off. "In fact, I'm probably going to obliviate you in a few minutes because I don't trust you with my secrets. It was really just morbid curiosity that brought me here."

He could tell his words hurt her. She actually flinched and glanced away. Her hand went to her throat. "Of course. I can't say I deserve any less." She looked back at him and gave him a watery sort of smile.

"Merde," Draco swore, because she looked like a weak, fragile sort of thing. "Why, in the name of Merlin, would you marry Lucius of all people if you're going to cry at the drop of a hat?"

Narcissa laughed a little, a helpless, sad sort of sound and she dashed her tears away with her hand. "I told him no at least a dozen times."

And that didn't fit with the narrative Draco had in his head at all. He paused and looked at her, really looked at her. There was nothing provocative or cold or ruthless about her now. He looked at the painting and the photographic quality of the detail. He pressed his eyes shut for a moment, thinking, and then opened them and looked up at his mother.

"It would be safer if the item I leave behind isn't just buried in the garden somewhere. It would be safer if there was a secret-keeper."

Narcissa nodded immediately. "Yes. I'll do it."

She said it quickly, far too quickly. It made Draco uncomfortable.

"I'll pay you, of course," said Draco. "Some upfront and more upon my return."

She shook her head. "Not money. I don't need money. I need something worth more."

Draco paused. Suspicion rose up. "What?"

"A bit of your time," said Narcissa.

Draco glanced at his watch. "I have to leave soon."

"When you come back then," said Narcissa. "Just a half hour. Or even less, twenty minutes. Just… I want to have a conversation with you. There are things I'd like to be able to tell you."

"I can safely promise you at least twenty minutes upon my return," said Draco. "In fact, you'll probably have more because I won't know a thing about you."

She paused for a moment. "What, exactly, are you leaving with me?"

Draco looked at her. "My memories."

oOoOoOoOo

Sensation.

Too much sensation.

Sights and sounds. Smells and tastes. Touches of pleasure and of pain.

Every memory in his head that he had pulled out five years ago was trying to cram itself back into place and his brain was overwhelmed. He couldn't make sense of it all. Each memory was perfectly preserved – he was a genius after all – and he was drowning in it. His brain desperately tried to tie the sensations into coherent clips of memory and then desperately trying to categorize all of it. Childhood memories and school memories. Family and acquaintances. Experiential knowledge and knowledge he had gleaned from books. Languages and music and art and potions and –

And magic.

He'd forgotten. How could he have – ?

But there were other things he had forgotten.

Lucius.

(Arms holding him tight, lip sneered in disgust, an approving drop of a hand on his shoulder, a vice-like grip on his arm, fear and love and longing - )

Lukas.

(Laughter and fun and adventure and safety and then tearing, ripping, screaming hole in heart - )

Narcissa.

(Cold and vacant and bliss, bliss, bliss followed by shrieking pain - )

The Dark Lord.

(Pain and fear. A knife. The cruciatus curse. The thick black oil of him pressed against his mind, trying to break in - )

His body rocked on the ground in remembered pain and panic. His head throbbed. His stomach lurched and bile rose up in his mouth. He felt his body heave and retch up breakfast, but the vomit was a faint taste in his mouth, faint against the memory of all other meals he had eaten.

Hogwarts' feasts. Fancy dinner parties. The uncomfortable meals of his childhood – the stifling tension of Lucius and Narcissa, the way food would lodge in his throat as he tried to swallow, the way his stomach would twist when he finally did. The humble, simple, friendly meals of Mrs. Weasley.

Weasleys.

Ginny.

(Glints of red and gold, dripping trepidation, bounding joy, laughter and kisses - )

Bill.

(A hand extended to him, pain in his knee, a smile, the scent of chalk and old parchments, a daring rescue in the middle of the night, a plea to save an unborn child, arms grabbing him in and holding him tight, steady companionship and belonging, and - )

Draco sucked in a breath. "Stop."

The memories stopped their bombardment.

He took in another breath and then carefully pushed the memories back, trying to get room to breathe. It felt jumbled in his head, like his memories were piled in heaps on the floor of his mind. That was fine. As long as they didn't all rush at him again he could pick through them later. Just not now, not when…

Not when he was at Narcissa's house.

Fear.

He jolted upright, his body tensing in panic and his hand immediately grabbing his wand.

But there was no one with him, just an empty room and puddle of vomit next to him. It was a simple matter of vanishing away the pool of sick. Another charm scrubbed through his mouth, removing the aftertaste.

It was old hat, those charms, and yet there was a voice in the back of his head that was excitedly chattering about magic and knowing magic and being able to do magic. He ruthlessly tamped the voice down. He got himself up and to his feet. His head spun. Pain in the base of his skull. Expected but still unpleasant. He'd need a pain reliever.

He glanced around the study and noticed the box on the ground. The memory box. The receptacle for his old memories, but also for the five years he had been missing. He remembered those years now. He remembered the cities he had traveled to. The fear he'd felt. The confusion. The time he had wasted learning computers and decryption algorithms only to realize the code and electronics were incompatible. The loneliness. The despair. The –

He slammed the door shut on those memories too. Now was not the time.

He picked the box up, immediately cataloguing the difference. When he had left the box with Narcissa, it'd been a plain, wooden box – old and ancient and of dark carved wood, slightly tarnished and battered. Now it had been painted. Delicately and beautifully painted.

Narcissa had talent.

He remembered her conversation with him. He remembered her explanation.

Anger flared up, cold and icy. His fingers clenched around his wand, but he forced them to relax. It wouldn't do to project anger. He strode out of the room and down the hall, not caring at the paintings he passed or the glimpses of Narcissa that were displayed. He didn't care to see them.

She was in the studio, sitting on her armchair. An easel was in front of her, but she wasn't painting. She was curled up in the seat, her hands wrapped around her tea mug, as if she was waiting for him. Her expression lifted when she saw him, hopeful and yearning, as if she hadn't expected he'd say goodbye to her on the way out.

Draco stopped in the doorway and looked down on her. "You need things to be beautiful?" he asked, voice clipped. "That's the excuse you give? That your pampered and aristocratic life was not beautiful enough?"

Her expression shuttered a little. "No, not an excuse. I'm weak, Draco. I told you that."

"Weak enough to arrange secret dalliances against the most powerful wizard in England?" Draco asked. "Weak enough to plan elaborate holidays and dinner parties and shopping sprees that pan all of Europe? Weak enough to brew your own potions when necessary? Does that sound weak to you, Mother?"

"Please, Draco, I-,"

"Moments of weakness I would understand," Draco cut in, voice dropping all of the cold fury he felt inside of him. "Moments of weakness I could even learn to forgive. I've know what it's like to crave a drug after all, thanks to you. But you're not weak; you're selfish. When things don't go your way, when they're not 'beautiful' enough for you, then you blame everyone else and play the role of victim."

She shook her head, tears dripping down her face. "No, no that's not true. I was sick. But I'm better now. Can't you see that?"

"Better?" Draco repeated, and then he laughed, a little cruelly. "You're not better, Narcissa. You're just living in a fantasy. Of course it's easy to be nice and good and better when you're living in a fairy-tale, but I have no doubt that with a single speck of conflict, and you'll be back to your narcissistic and self-absorbed ways. No, you're not better. And you wont be. Not until you admit that you're just as much a villain as the rest of this family."

She folded in on herself, her thin shoulders heaving, and wept. She wasn't even trying to deny his statements, wasn't trying to argue. She was just giving in. The victim yet again.

"Stay here," Draco told her, feeling a bit of exhaustion creep into his voice. "Merlin knows it's the only place you'll be able to operate in."

He turned to leave. She called out after him. "Will you come back? Will you visit?"

Draco wanted to say no. He wanted to crush her under his foot the way one crushed fallen petals on the pavement in spring. He sucked in a breath. His head was spinning. His throat felt tight. His stomach felt queasy.

"Good-bye, Mother," he said, unable to answer her.

He strode out of the house and past the overflowing luscious garden and into the yard. He Apparated away, back to the Malfoy Manor, back home and –

The scent hit him first. Gardenia, honeysuckle, dragon-bloom, and fire-orchid. A mix of sweet, citrus, and musk that was immediately familiar and comforting to him.

Home.

He was home.

The next breath he took in was deep and long. His legs felt strangely weak as he took his first steps towards the manor. It was exactly as he had left it – the same pale gay stone, the sprawling wings of the manor, the sculpted trim around the windows, the intricate stonework.

Although the vegetable garden peeking out the back corner was new. Not that he hadn't seen it before. It just meant more to him now. His mind filtered through the implications of that garden. Economics. Safety. Supply and demand. Food rationing.

But then his mind flipped to different memories, vivid and intense, almost as if he was experiencing the moments all over again. Walking with Lucius. Riding thestrals. Dinner parties. Holidays. Mornings spent in the center of the hedge maze, sprawled on the stone bench in the center, a stack of books on the ground. Hot summer nights walking through the fountain, trousers rolled up and feet bare. Long days, alone except for the house-elves, feeling like he would suffocate from the boredom.

The memories crashed over him like an ocean wave. Draco paused, held his breath, and pushed them back again. The memories receded, unhappily. His head felt thick.

Draco ignored the ache. He was Draco Malfoy. He was home.

He had work to do.

He had more than work to do. He had a savior to save, a good deal of translating to do, a bit of travel, and most likely, a lot of fighting. Perhaps even a murder.

He hoped not though.

He ran lightly up the front steps, mind spinning – but in a good way. He was already plotting, already organizing. Logistics were considered, re-arranged, and discarded. He reached the front steps and the doors automatically opened for him, sensing his presence, sensing the signum on his back, and for a moment, he stopped. The planning paused as he took in the flush of warmth that traveled across his back and shoulders.

He was home.

"Draco!"

Draco glanced up. Harry Potter was on the upper floor, leaning over the balcony. He looked a little frazzled.

"Where the hell were you?" Potter asked. "You can't just leave like that! You had the whole house in uproar."

Draco ignored the rant. He pointed at the boy-hero. "We need to talk. Not now. But soon."

He didn't wait for a response, just kept walking, past the portraits and the tapestries, underneath the chandeliers and painted ceilings, over the marble floors. Every detail was exactly as he remembered.

He turned down the main hall towards the kitchens. The Order seemed to prefer the collection of rooms by the kitchens, the semi-formal dining room, the casual living room, and the den. He could hear voices as he approached, partially raised and tensed voices.

He rounded the doorway. His eyes immediately picked out Bill. The red-head was scrubbing a hand over his face. There was a map on the table in front of him. Sirius Black was beside him, arguing a little. Mr. Weasley was in the corner, looking frustrated. Blaise's head was in the fireplace. A Floo call.

Draco cleared his throat. All eyes snapped his way, even Blaise's head.

"Bloody hell!" Blaise swore, and then his face withdrew.

"Draco!" Bill exclaimed, relief evident on his face. His voice sounded harried though. "Where were you? We were looking all over for you!"

"So I see," said Draco. He tipped his head towards the door. "A word, Bill?"

He stepped back out in the hall and then headed towards the kitchen, intent on a cup of tea.

He had a mug out and the kettle on the stove by the time Bill came in after him. "What were you doing, Draco?" Bill asked. "You scared about five years off of us. What if something happened to you?"

Draco felt his lips twist up at the obvious concern. "I'm fine, Bill."

Bill stopped short. Draco catalogued the differences in his appearance in the few seconds Bill stared at him. There were faint crinkles in the corner of his eyes. His brow boasted shallow frown lines. There was a faint scar on the side of his face that hadn't been there before. It looked slightly ragged – not a spell then. But other than that, it was Bill. Long red hair. Freckles. Eyes bright.

"Draco?" Bill asked, incredulous.

Draco raised an eyebrow. "Surprise."

His voice wasn't as droll as he wanted it to be. It was impossible to keep all of the warmness from the greeting.

Bill gaped, then laughed, and then grabbed him into a hug. Draco didn't fight the embrace, even stepped into it and clapped Bill on the back because –

Because it had been five years. It didn't feel like five years. And he didn't fully remember those five years – or rather, those memories hadn't fully been integrated into his brain just yet, they were slowly trickling in – but he still felt distant. Removed. Left behind in a sort of way.

Bill's grip around him let him feel connected; let him feel like he belonged. But then years of etiquette classes came rushing back to him, and he stiffened. Bill immediately stepped back. He kept one hand on his shoulder though, like he was afraid Draco was going to run.

"Merlin, you're here," he said, a wide, dumbfounded grin on his face. "Look at you!"

Draco rolled his eyes and then ducked out of his grasp to prod the kettle into boiling with his wand. He poured a cup of tea and then poured another for Bill. He sat at the side table, letting the tea steep.

"I've been five years without a proper cup of tea," Draco said, mostly to avoid talking about anything else. "Five years without knowing what a proper cup of tea was. That's the most tragic thing about the thing I think."

Bill took the chair across from him. He leaned forward. "How did you find your memories? Where were they?"

Draco should have remembered how good Bill was at asking all the difficult questions. He fiddled with the steeper and then glanced up at Bill. "Pretend you don't have any memories. Pretend you've been alone and confused for months, and then you finally meet people who know you. They say that they're your friends, but they also tell you that you can't meet your own family, that it's not safe to meet your family. Where are you going to go?"

Bill's face became stricken. "Narcissa."

"Everyone knew that I would not leave my memories with her," said Draco. "But it is the one place that a memory-less boy is guaranteed to go. It's ingenious, really, if I do say so myself."

"You left them there, or you left them with her?" Bill asked.

Draco sucked in a breath. The visit with Narcissa, and the emotions that were dragged up, were still too raw. "Shit, Bill. I forgot what a pain in the arse you were."

Bill didn't say anything, just waited as Draco pulled the steeper out of his tea, added a small amount of cream to his mug, and took a sip.

"I left them with her, in fact," he said. "It wasn't the plan originally, but she's sober."

"Sober?"

"I was more surprised than you," said Draco. "And she agreed to be a secret-keeper."

"Why?"

"Because she wanted the chance to give me her sob story," said Draco. "She wanted to excuse her behavior by playing the victim and making me feel sorry for her." He put his mug down on the table and reached up to pinch at the bridge of his nose. His head was beginning to ache again. No, not again. It had never stopped aching. It was just becoming more painful.

Memory spells. They weren't recommended for long-term use. They weren't recommended for wiping an entire seventeen years.

Draco could picture the medical reviews in his head now. 'Long term use of memory spells can result in unwanted chronic side effects including continued amnesia, lack of memory re-integration, loss of sense of self, personality change, mood lability, flashbacks, disturbed sleep, and migraines. Short term side effects, following sudden re-integration of memories, include severe headache, vertigo, confusion, paranoia, nausea, vomiting, fever, cold sweats, night-terrors – '

Draco cut the list off. It wasn't helping.

"Did it work?" Bill asked.

It took Draco a minute to realize what he was asking. He shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe until I actually got my memories back, but then I remembered everything and -,"

He remembered the potions slipping down his throat. Remembered the colors and visions that danced in front of his eyes. He remembered the pain and the intense, yearning ache that seemed to crack through his bones as his body plummeted into withdrawal. He remembered screaming. He remembered crying, no tears, and shivering in Lucius' arms.

It was all so real and overwhelming that he gasped in a breath and half-crumpled over the table, his mug rocking and splashing tea over the side.

"Draco!"

That was Bill's voice, concern spiking through it, and Draco had heard that tone of voice before. He remembered it on the Quidditch field, his knee crumpled under him; in a cabin, hiding from the Death Eaters; in his apartment, high on Angel Flight.

A hand on his forehead snapped him back from the memories. He jerked back, eyes wild and breath heavy.

"Draco, are you okay?" Bill demanded.

He wanted to answer, he truly did, but the words were stuck in his throat. Was he okay? He remembered his knee being snapped. He remembered fighting for Bill through a horde of Death Eaters. He remembered being high.

"Je vais bien," Draco said, trying to wave his concern away. He was belatedly aware that his words didn't come out the way he wanted. And then the French words he had spoken suddenly got translated into English, and Latin, and Italian, and Gaelic, and then it kept going, the thoughts in his head getting filtered through a dozen different dialects, and it wasn't just hearing the words, he could see them written as well, and he was conjugating verbs and switching the order of adjectives and –

And he needed dark. He needed dark and quiet and alone so that he could finally get his thoughts straight. He needed safety.

He pushed himself up and started walking, keeping one hand trailing on the wall, half-guiding him. His footsteps took him towards the dungeons. He could hear Bill tagging along behind him, could hear him ask if he was okay, but he wasn't entirely present. He was living out his childhood again – left to his own devices in the manor, taking refuge in the dungeons and experimenting with rather dangerous potions ingredients. He remembered creating strange concoctions that fizzled and boiled and flamed up. He remembered hiding all evidence of his work when he was finished, so no one else would know. He remembered times when he couldn't go down there – Lucius had locked the doors, meaning there was an unwilling guest imprisoned inside. He remembered waking up, his head throbbing, confined with a group of children from school.

He pushed open the door to the dungeons just when that particularly memory played through – a prisoner in his own home, getting marched up to meet Voldemort in the blue conference room, a knife through his arm.

His knees buckled at the remembered pain. Bill grabbed his arm and slowed his descent to the ground.

"Draco, what's wrong?" Bill demanded.

Another voice sounded from the stairs below, a low, sonorous sort of voice. "Feeling a little dramatic, are we, Mr. Malfoy?"

Memories slammed into him. A tall man. Pale skin, dark hair, black eyes, a rather overlooked, unappreciated sort of drama about him. Moments of companionship, and guarded words of advice. The comforting notion that he could be a source of help if needed. A sharp mind for facts, but limited social graces.

"Professor Snape," he managed.

Something thumped, like it had been dropped onto a wooden table. Footsteps sounded towards him, running lightly up the stairs. A figure knelt in front of him.

Draco remembered Potion's class, all six and a half years of it. He remembered sneering insults at Potter, the scent of smoke and soot, the feel of heat and steam.

"I don't know what's wrong with him," Bill said somewhere above him.

Draco tried to bring himself back to the present, tried to focus on the sallow face in front of him.

"Ah," said Snape. "I don't suppose you had the foresight to ease your memories back into that head of yours, instead of just dumping the whole lot back in at once?"

"Only one memory box," Draco said, struggling through the muddled mess of his brain. "I couldn't… couldn't find any others. Couldn't waste anymore time."

He remembered the decision, remembered holding the box in his hands, remembered weighing the risk. He remembered pulling the memories out – the pain – the disorientation – the fear.

Draco's hands went to his head. The world spun.

"His memories are doing this?" he heard Bill ask.

"All of his memories were returned at once," said Snape, pitching his voice low. "For anyone that would be overwhelming. For someone like Draco, with perfect recall, I imagine it's closer to reliving full moments of his life."

Draco leaned forward to put his head between his knees because his stomach was rolling again. Snape pulled him up though and directed him down the stairs. Draco remembered walking down these stairs – hundreds and hundreds of times before. Sometimes he ran down, eager to start his work. Sometimes he walked slower, loneliness adding weight to his feet. Sometimes he trailed a hand on the railing, a book held in front of him, his eyes skimming over the pages.

Draco was deposited in a chair – well-stuffed and soft. Something was draped over him – a blanket, knitted. His fingers knotted in the blanket because this was new. There were no memories tied to the blanket.

He blinked down at it – a rich, green yarn. Even stitches. Handmade. Mrs. Weasley most likely. He glanced around the dungeon, and that was different too. The armchair, a side table and lamp, Snape's own potions' set up.

"Back with us?" Bill asked.

Draco looked over. Bill looked different too, and Draco latched onto those differences. The faint lines on his face. The pinch around his eyes.

"I'm fine," said Draco.

Bill laughed a little. "You aren't, but it's good to hear you say that."

Draco reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose, his head still aching. "Apparently my brain needs to re-organize itself."

"But you remember," said Bill. "You remember why you left?"

The Merlin Code.

Images rose up – the runes he'd been studying for five years. The jolted, uneven, sometimes repeated and triplicated progress he had made over the past five years. All that information slammed into him, an entire new language – but more than that – a new form of magic. He remembered Bill writing the water rune on the table. He remembered the water that flowed up.

He remembered what he had to do with the code.

Draco suddenly realized that he wasn't breathing because Bill was shouting at him, hands on his face, and his lungs were burning. The breath came automatically, but the runes didn't stop flashing over his vision, not until something pungent suddenly filled his lungs, and he choked on the next breath.

"Well, Mr. Malfoy?"

Draco blinked up at Snape and the vial he held in his hand. He didn't need to see the vial to know what it was, he could tell just based on the smell. "Aconite."

"Precisely." The Potion's Master moved back towards his cauldrons. "Perhaps you can tell me what I'm brewing."

"Wolfsbane," said Draco immediately.

"Maybe we could brew him a calming potion?" Bill asked.

Snape shook his head. "Hardly necessary. He just needs to learn to ground himself. Ingredient's list, Draco."

"Aconite," Draco said again, memories coming back, but calmly, orderly. He knew this information. "Diluted dragon's blood. Wormwood infusion. Bezoar water. Dittany. Sprig of holly. Dusting of silver."

"Instructions," said Snape.

Draco took in a breath. He knew this too. He could picture the instructions on the page and he could remember brewing the potion, dozens of times. "Start with a half cauldron of water – copper preferable." The instructions came easily to his mind and fell easily off his lips, the information being logged and placed into the proper filing cabinet in his mind. When he finished talking, he could feel the pressure ease.

"Quite correct," said Snape dryly. "10 points to Slytherin."

Draco sat back in the armchair. It was quite comfortable. Actually, from the rather homey additions to the dungeons, it looked as if Snape used it as a hiding place. Snape added something to one of the three cauldrons currently over the flames and then turned to Draco. "I am pleased to have you with us again."

Draco felt his lips tip up slightly. "It's good to recognize you, Professor."

"Not a Professor anymore," said Snape. "And I believe you are of the age where you can call me Severus."

Draco paused for a moment, letting that sink in. He was five years older than he remembered being. He was twenty-two.

There was a moment of incredulity. He'd imagined being in his twenties – a good job, doing what, he didn't know. He planned on travelling overseas. He'd thought he might sponsor a Quidditch team.

Instead, the very last thing he remembered of his real life was being seventeen.

Seventeen. And now he was in his twenties. He'd missed moments in his life, important moments. Turning eighteen and sneaking into the Muggle world to visit a few nightclubs with friends. Turning twenty and having a large party.

Graduating school.

"I haven't even taken my NEWTs," he realized, slightly horrified.

To his right, Bill laughed. "Of course that's what you've taken away from all of this."

Draco sat back in the chair. "A lack of education is hardly something to laugh at," he said, slightly cross. He sat up again, a thought crossing his mind. "Where's Ginny?"

OoOoOoOoO

"Miss Weasley?" the secretary asked. "You've a visitor in the conference room."

Ginny frowned. She had no interviews to conduct, and no meetings scheduled. "Who is it?"

"It's a personal visitor," said the secretary. She shot Ginny a wink and left.

Ginny's frowned deepened, but she pushed back from the desk and walked down to the conference room. She paused in the doorway. Draco was inside, standing in profile to her, looking out the window.

He was wearing dress robes over a silver-gray suit. That made Ginny pause at first because he'd been favoring more casual wear – not having the aristocratic sensibilities that he been instilled in him from birth. But he was standing differently too. His spine was straight, shoulders squared, when he'd been slouching ever-so-slightly before. His head was tilted at just the right angle to assume a somewhat snobbish air.

"Draco?" Ginny asked.

She watched his fingers clench as he turned, like he was bracing himself. His eyes swept over her, head to toe and then back to her face. His lips twitched up.

"Ginny," he said back, voice carefully measured and controlled.

She knew that voice. Her hand went to her throat. "You're back," she said, somewhat stupidly.

"Yes," said Draco. He took a step towards her. "I missed you."

Ginny felt something irrationally angry rise in her chest. "You didn't even remember me."

She, on the other hand, remembered Draco for five years. Worried about him, cried over him, hoped for him.

He frowned, as if that hadn't quite occurred to him. "I suppose that's correct." His hand went to his collar where he still wore the necklace with the ring on it. "It might be more accurate to say I missed the idea of you."

"It's not quite the same," said Ginny.

Draco visibly stopped himself from taking another step forward. His face was pinched – a tell of frustration, but also maybe of pain because he looked a little peaked, and he was holding himself just a tad too stiffly.

"Maybe not," he allowed. His brows furrowed. "Does it need to be the same? Missing each other?"

"I suppose not," said Ginny. "I don't even know why I said it. It's not as if I would want you to be as miserable as I was. It's just," she took in a breath. There were tears behind her eyes, but she didn't want to cry.

Draco frowned. "I didn't want you to be miserable. I told you that you didn't have to wait."

"Of course I waited for you," Ginny said, her words half-choked. "I'm always going to wait for you, Draco."

And then she walked forward, not the eager, joyful leap she had the first time she saw him. That moment of bliss had passed. Now there was a heavy, heart-wrenching relief. She reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck. He pulled her in tight and rested his forehead on hers.

"You seemed happier the first time you saw me," he said.

"I'm still happy."

"You're crying," he countered.

"Happy tears," she said. "And a few sad tears, but only because I missed you that much."

He pulled back a few inches. "No more sad tears."

"Only if you promise not to leave again," Ginny bargained.

His lips quirked up. "Promise."

He leaned down and she stretched up to seal the deal with a kiss.

OoOoOoOoO

Leave a review! There was minimal editing on this chapter. All mistakes are due to my sleep-deprived mind. Also, I have opinions about Narcissa. What are yours?
